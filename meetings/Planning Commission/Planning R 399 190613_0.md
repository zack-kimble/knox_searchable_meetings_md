| 0:14:26| That's already been taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=868)|

| 0:14:36| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Yeah, Madam Chair, if we could add item number 36 to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Chris Burkhart, I-40 Construction Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| Add 36?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| Is there any opposition in the audience to adding item number 36 to the consent list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=891)|
| 0:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| I'd like to make a motion that we hear consent with the exception of removing items number 26, 35, and 37| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=902)|
| 0:15:13| and adding item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Commissioner Graf, did you have a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| How can we add something to the consent list at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| It's your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| That's the strength of this body is you can adapt and revise your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| We don't know if there's been opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| And the Chair asked if there were opposition present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| There's no opposition present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| The reason staff did not put it on the consent agenda, we initially had thought it would go on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| We received a couple phone calls with questions and concerns, but apparently those have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| There's no opposition here present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| As Mr. Wise said, it's now the will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| You do have the authority to place something on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| There's no opposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| We have not yet voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| We've got a motion and a second, and we will be voting to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| And if anyone chooses not to hear that, you can voice that with your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| So we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to hear the consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1010)|

| 0:16:54| Motion to approve consent list as heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to hear the consent list as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| Approve as heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1025)|

| 0:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1031)|
| 0:17:19| Okay, we're going to move on with our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| The first agenda item is agenda number 5B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1041)|
| 0:17:38| If you'll let me get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| This one was 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Okay, this is the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Consideration of the Comprehensive Update of the City of Knoxville Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1070)|
| 0:18:03| I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Green for any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| Thank you, and I'll be somewhat brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I had at least a couple of workshops for the planning commission late last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| The commission heard it at your January meeting and recommended it on to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| City council had recommended certain revisions to address concerns and issues brought by the public at their workshops and review of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1102)|
| 0:18:36| As a result of those proposed revisions, the council remanded it back to this commission for further consideration and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1116)|
| 0:18:46| I've sent you the staff recommendation based on discussion at Tuesday's agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| That revised recommendation is for approval of the draft ordinances presented to you with some revisions following that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| The revisions would be to table 5-3 to the DK sub-district's dimensional standards to revise the building height in the downtown historic or the DKH sub-district from 85 feet to 125 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1141)|
| 0:19:19| Table 6-1 in the industrial district's dimensional standards added the following statement as a condition for the maximum building height in the industrial research and development IRD district, the industrial general, the IG, and the industrial heavy IH districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1159)|
| 0:19:39| This statement, however, structures must set back an additional one foot for every two feet of height over 50 feet from any required setback abutting a presidential district lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1179)|
| 0:19:51| That's to avoid tall structures. The maximum height in those districts is 90 feet. It's to prevent tall structures from looming over small single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1191)|
| 0:20:02| And that statement is present in the commercial districts and the office districts that permit taller heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| In section 8-9, the hillside protection overlay zoning district revised section 8.9.B applicability to have the hillside protection overlay district regulations apply only to lots within residential districts and to clarify the exemption of lots of record by having this exemption apply only to lots over a size determined appropriate by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1209)|
| 0:20:31| Following review of the impact of this exemption. And that's staff's recommendation. I'd be happy to answer any questions or hear comments from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1231)|
| 0:20:41| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| I didn't realize I was on, but I would, based on staff's recommendation, I would like to make a motion of Knox County planning staff recommendation to approve the draft update of the city of Knoxville zoning ordinance with the amendments as proposed by the city council and staff and the draft zoning map with the following revisions to the draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1245)|
| 0:21:09| Table 5-3 DK sub districts dimensional standards revise the maximum building height in the DK-H sub district to 125 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1269)|
| 0:21:20| Table 6-1 industrial districts dimensional standards add the following statement as a condition for the maximum building height in the IRV, IG and IH districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1280)|
| 0:21:34| However, structures must set back an additional one foot for every two feet of height over 50 feet for many required setback abutting a residential district lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1294)|
| 0:21:44| Section 8.9 hillside protection overlay zoning district revise section 8.9 B applicability to have the hillside protection overlay district regulations apply only to lots within residential districts and clarify the exemption of lots of record by having this exemption apply only to lots over a size determined appropriate by staff following review of the impact of this exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1304)|
| 0:22:08| Second, Commissioner Hill's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Phillips. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| I just want to express what I expressed on Tuesday at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| I think this thing still needs a lot of work before I'm comfortable voting for it to go back to the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1345)|
| 0:22:35| I've received a lot of phone calls from people that are talking about how their property was rezoned and it didn't make a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| Putting the hilltop ridgetop plan into this as an overlay onto this, I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| I think that should be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I mean, we worked on that thing for a couple of years and we couldn't come up with a consensus in the city council nor county commission, either one ever promulgated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1371)|
| 0:23:02| And I don't think it's time to do that by slipping it into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| I think that should be handled separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| I also, from the beginning, have had a problem with, in the commercial zones, restricting building materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| I don't think that's what our zoning laws ought to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Of course, that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| I can't support sending this as a recommendation back to city council in the shape it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| I think we need some time to get all this together where we're actually not sending back a working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| We're sending back a document that says this is what we believe is the way it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| And I know that's going to take some time and I know they've been working on it and spent a lot of money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| But I think because of that, because we spent a lot of money on it and there's been a lot of time on it, I think we need to finish it before we send it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1422)|
| 0:23:51| In staff's opinion, as it is finished, while I agree, could agree with you on the whole site protection, for example, the rezoning of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| And I apologize for not having the – having had time to finish all the footnotes on the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| But it shows that in most – the only district in which there was a significant change of zoning designation was the office district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| And most of those changes were to institutional because our current office zoning does not recognize large institutional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| Developments like UT Hospital, UT Campus, other major hospitals, Pellissippi State, they went from office designation to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1460)|
| 0:24:30| So there's a bit more than even split between those commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1470)|
| 0:24:36| Ninety-some percent went to commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Those that did not primarily went to office districts to recognize the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| The residential districts, approximately – I'm trying to remember – 94 percent went to residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Those who did not because the use has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| The proposed zoning recognizes the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| For example, the most obvious one is the open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Ninety-nine point one percent of what's currently zoned open space will be zoned open space under the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| With regard to the materials limitations, not prohibitions but limitations, 25 percent of the facade of certain buildings are limited to certain materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1504)|
| 0:25:16| Bearings could be granted if there's a reason to have more than 25 percent of those materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| That is in exchange for greater intensity of development in those CG2, CH2, and CR2 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| We've vetted that with the American Institute of Architects, the East Tennessee section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| They're comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I, at this point, don't know what we could do to make it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| We're a diverse community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| We'll never please everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Even on this commission, we'll never please everyone because of the diversity of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| What we have to do is do something that step outside personal self-interest, and this goes to the community as a whole, and look at the community, the good to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| Not whether this is good within my front yard or from my front porch, but whether for the community it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| And I'll speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| I talked with someone last night who's looking at a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| If they try to develop it, in keeping with the current character of that area, they're looking at a three-month delay over $1,000 in fees for variances, special exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1566)|
| 0:26:18| Under the proposed ordinance, they would be able to go down and pick up their building from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| How much longer do we stall development that the city wants in order to please everyone in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1582)|
| 0:26:30| I don't think we'll ever please everyone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| Not that I'm passionate about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I really hadn't noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| I didn't notice that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| And as you should be, as you should be, because I think the work that's been done has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| Some of the comments that I had just today, though, for example, with the zoning, and you may be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| It's over near the Sacred Heart Cathedral in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| There were some areas that are currently zoned office got rezoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| And it's zoned C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| And my question would be, these people that are having their property rezoned, can they opt out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| Can they ask for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Can they say, no, I don't want my property rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| That property, for example, we've received that comment from the owner of one of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And the use has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| The zoning that's proposed is equivalent to the C6 zoning that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| And what has happened is that the use of that property has primarily changed to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| And we've told the person who commented that if that person would talk to his neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| we would change the designation because we don't always know about the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| We're still revising the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| The city council will review the map in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| And so we're still revising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| It's still a draft map, and the map does need some work, and we're making changes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| And the ordinance itself provides a provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| Opting out is not an option because we don't have something to opt out to if we adopt the new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| We're not maintaining the existing zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| What do they do? Opt out and have them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I'm not sure their neighbors would like them to have no zoning or them themselves, but we do have a provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| It's codified in the draft ordinance that within a year, the owners of the property can apply with no fee to go through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| Then it's up to a comparable zone, the most comparable zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And, again, I think we've done a very good job of finding those comparable zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| I think we'll have a few, obviously, and I think realistically we'll have a few applications, but there's no fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| Staff, because it's a legislative process, staff can't change that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| It has to go through the legislative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| But we're making it as easy as possible for those who disagree with the designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| or where we may have looked at the records we have, which are tax records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1728)|
| 0:28:55| Google street drive-bys and actual drive-bys in real life by properties trying to determine the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1735)|
| 0:29:03| And the input we've had from the public, we've had a lot of comments on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| And, again, the maps are not completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I encourage the public who want to know what their property is on to look at the recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| or propose zoning to look at the recode.com site and make comments on the map because we're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1755)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| And, again, I don't think we'll ever reach perfection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| We're not capable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| I don't know that we as humans are capable of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| I'm very uncomfortable with the way it came back with regard to Hillside, just like Jeff is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| And when I get done, I'd like to hear from Mr. Hill about what his motion, how it changes, what came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1785)|
| 0:29:54| But, you know, it codified Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| It's going to affect a whole lot more people than I think the original version was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| And I just couldn't vote for it the way it came back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| But if Mr. Hill's amendment made it, you know, brought it back to where it was when we sent it to city council with respect to Hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1806)|
| 0:30:16| then I would like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| But I'm fine with a postponement, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| I mean, this is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| There's no rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I don't know why we're trying to rush this thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| And I know you're not going to agree with that, but that's my opinion and that's the opinion of a lot of people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| Well, let's get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| I mean, that's what our job is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Let's take our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Let's go through it and make sure that we know what we're voting for and we can defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| I'll answer the easy question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| The amendment proposed by Mr. Hill, which is repeating staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| would take it back to what it was when the commission approved in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| that the Hillside standards would apply only to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Existing single-family homes and lots of record would be exempted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| And there is a question about large lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| If you have a 20-acre lot, could you go grade it and flatten it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| And I think staff has to review, does have to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| But the other, exempting the commercial properties is proposed by Mr. Hill's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| or a motion from the Hillside standards would bring it back to the way it was initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| And I've talked to enough people about this that there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| every day I hear from different sides and they don't agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| I don't think we'll ever have everyone in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| even this room agree on every provision in the draft ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| That's the challenge that this commission has of trying to approve something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| that is overall good for the community and that's maybe better for some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| The person I talked to last evening, it will be better for that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| I'm trying to think of someone that it would not be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| I think maybe going to Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| if you have a building in the CG3 zoning district and you have unlimited height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| as opposed to a 35-foot height limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| that's quite an incentive to minimize the use of vinyl to 25% on the front of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| I think that's a reasonable exchange of that material restriction that was referenced by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1935)|
| 0:32:25| I just don't think, in three years of my life on this, it seems like a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| And I know some people have just gotten, become aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| You've still got a lot of years left, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| You've still got a lot of years left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I know, but I don't want to spend them all on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| But I know some people in the community are becoming just aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| I do wonder about that because I think, as of now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| we're not counting this as a community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| but I think I've gone to 90 community meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| Yeah, and that's the thing, is the 20-something meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| I remember we talked about for a long time before we sent it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| it seems like a significant amount of this thing has changed since we had those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| I think the changes have been small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| There have been a number of clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| The most significant changes since this commission sent it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| one is the expansion of the hillside standards to all properties as opposed to just residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Another one was taking a portion of the non-conformance sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| and taking out the wording that the consultants had proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| and city staff and planning staff had worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| taking that out and putting in the wording from the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Standards for variances and special uses or uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| those have reverted back to the wording in our current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| So the most significant changes outside the hillside are going from the proposed language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| and the draft to the language we have in our current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| because the community felt more comfortable with that current language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| So some may think that's a big change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| but it's a change back to what people are familiar with, so it's not a big revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2043)|
| 0:34:10| Again, I don't think the community will ever reach agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| which is why it's the purview of this commission to recommend thinking again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2054)|
| 0:34:20| about the community good as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| and finally the challenge before city council to do what's good for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| as opposed to what's good for the local people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I would just like to speak just for a few minutes on behalf of Recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| and all of the work that has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| I, too, feel that it would be very difficult to ever have 100 percent consensus on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| To be able to strategically change a 50-year-old code is a pretty daunting feat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2092)|
| 0:35:01| and I also believe that the planning staff, along with our consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| did an incredible, exceptional job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I think they were thoughtful in this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| and I support Recode going on to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| I think also city council, I don't know what, 15, 20 hours they've already spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| They, too, are going through this with a fine-tooth comb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| They are the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| and they have, too, been very thoughtful in their process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| and I applaud everybody's efforts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I think this will move Knoxville forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| We are growing substantially, and I think we are all proud of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and I'm also proud of Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I also want to echo the city council has done an awesome job of taking what we did approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| and many of the changes are what city council has painstakingly gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| and listening to their constituents and coming to agreement on most of the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| And so I agree that I don't know what postponing this would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| What more planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| Right now the planning department is taking direction from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| The legislative body is asking to do the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| so I also don't, I really would like to see this move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| so we have this as a tool for making decisions in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Right now we're kind of in a state of flux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Do we look at the old? Do we look at the new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| So the sooner that, to me, the sooner Recode can get in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| and find ways to make changes to those parts that are not workable or working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2209)|
| 0:36:57| We have a member of the audience that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| Sir, your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Michael Kelly, 550 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And let me begin by saying I am not here opposing the new ordinance that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| as I understand it, rezones every single property in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| But I am here asking the commission to echo Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| and Commissioner Roth that this needs some more evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| At a minimum it needs a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| This is a massive undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| And what came back from city council, the zoning ordinance is 431 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| City council made 73 changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| Staff recommended 15 additional changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| I would ask the question whether each commissioner has evaluated all of those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| Furthermore, I think it is not accurate to think of this body's duty as simply to do what a municipality asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2280)|
| 0:38:11| There is a court of appeals case that talks about the fact that if a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| as of course you all know, if a municipality makes changes to a zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| it has to come back to the planning commission for review and comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| And here is what the court of appeals said in the Wilgus v. City of Murfreesboro case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| talking about the authority and expertise of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| The purpose of requiring submission to the planning commission is to give the legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| the advantage of the commission's expertise on land use planning with respect to the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| that it must either adopt or reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| And then goes on to say the lawmaking powers of the municipality being vested in its governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2333)|
| 0:39:03| there is no requirement that it abide by the commission's suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| It is required, however, that it have before it those suggestions when it acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| The statutory requirement is meaningless unless the fundamental considerations created by the terms of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| militating for or against its adoption were actually before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| And a rubber stamp doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| These changes, many of them are substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| and all I'm saying is the commission needs to take time to look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| The planning commission's, the staff's recommendation, as I see it, is one fell swoop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2378)|
| 0:39:46| It doesn't analyze or make recommendations or comments on these 73 proposed changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| So all I'm saying is, as I guess it was Commissioner Smith said, this is a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2391)|
| 0:39:58| Be sure to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| What's the hurry where so much has gone into it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| If it came back with one insignificant change, a wording change, one definition, I don't think that would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2404)|
| 0:40:12| But with changes this significant, it's just incumbent upon this body, which has expertise, to really evaluate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| One last comment that is sort of procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| I don't see that the process that's been used has actually complied with the planning commission's own administrative regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| The bylaws require you to adopt administrative regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| Those regulations have been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| They set out a mandatory schedule for things to come before this commission for evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| and that includes the timing for things to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| As I look at it, city council didn't finish their work until I think it was May 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2452)|
| 0:40:59| And as I understand the process, there should have been an application deadline for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| Even the second double-fee application would have been May 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| So I don't know legally and practically how it got on this agenda without the requisite time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2470)|
| 0:41:19| So for that reason, too, and I think it's not just that the time period is arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| The whole idea is there should be sufficient time for the commission, the staff, and the commission to evaluate changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| If you do that with one rezoning of one parcel of property in North Knoxville, where I grew up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| if you require that kind of deadline, surely you're going to require that amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| when you do a massive rezoning like this that has this many changes from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| So I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| I'd encourage the commission just to, again, not opposing it, just take time to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| Mr. Kelly, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| I'm going to allow Mr. Green to address the issue about it being on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| However, what Commissioner Hill read with regards to the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| what you didn't see was we had pages of information about what changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| and we had a document that specified in green exactly every change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| So we were able to look at the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| It bothers me that you insinuate that we have not looked at what the changes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2544)|
| 0:42:31| and are acting capriciously without reviewing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| It really bothers me that you're insinuating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| So we have looked at the information, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I just wanted to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| That's a lot of changes for something that only came out two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| It was provided to us in our agenda package, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| But I will allow Mr. Green to address the issue about the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| This was reconsideration of an item previously on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| The executive director has the ability to waive the application, and I have on other applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| Given that the commission had reviewed this extensively in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| the information was provided in time for their packet to get the packet out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| They were aware that this was on their agenda coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| The deadline was waived on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Is there a written decision that validates the waiver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| I mean, is there something that says that's what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Maybe an email, I think, that we can meet the advertising deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| There was an email conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| Yes, ma'am, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| Jennifer Roach, 609 Weisgarber Road, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| I know there's quite a number of people that would like to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| so I would just ask for procedural guidance as to how you would like us to come up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2625)|
| 0:43:52| Is now the time and we just keep coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Now's the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Well, I guess I'll start if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Do you want to give her more time up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| I'd like more than 19 seconds, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Do you want to give her 23 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| I think that what we will do, this is kind of a commission vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| is to give each person a maximum of three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Are you comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| How many people have we got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| How many people wish to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Three more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| Okay, five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Just give them six minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I'll give them two minutes apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| Oh, five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Oh, five minutes each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Not to say you have to take all five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| It can be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| So I'd like to speak to a couple of different major changes that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| I'm sorry, did you already give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Jennifer Roach, 609 Wise Garber Road, Knoxville Area Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| I'd like to speak to a couple of the major changes that were made by city council that came back to you in this draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| One of those is in Article 4 under residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| and that is the insertion of the functional family and occupancy limits that come from our current code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2712)|
| 0:45:23| but it's quite old language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| This language is very backwards looking, quite discriminatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| and looks at the folks who are living in a house to set those occupancy limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| regulates unrelated persons differently than related persons within a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| and we would strongly suggest that some fair housing guidelines be looked at to base occupancy limits on the size of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2742)|
| 0:45:53| the dwelling structure, its bedroom space and living space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| We've seen a couple suggestions that I've talked about with city legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| One of those is to allow two persons per bedroom plus two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| So, for example, a three-bedroom house will allow eight people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Another way is to look at the building codes that require a minimum of 70 square feet in a bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| and then 50 square feet for each additional occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| We looked at our multiple listing service listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| When we looked at houses of all age ranges, new, mid-century, historic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| most of those houses have bedrooms of 100 square feet or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Some of the older houses have it as low as 80 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| so we'd really like the body here to come up with something that's as forgiving as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| so that we help those folks that are living in housing insecurity situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| unrelated folks that need to live together to make their bills or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| that gives them the most leeway so that they're not put in a more insecure position for their housing reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2820)|
| 0:47:10| The next thing I'd like to speak on is the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| I sent a recommendation earlier this week that our group would suggest that this body send a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2834)|
| 0:47:23| like was read from Mr. Hill's motion, that the hillside protection overlay be codified only to residential properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2843)|
| 0:47:33| and I thought that might be an adequate compromise position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| I am here to let you know from my membership, at whose pleasure that I serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| from those folks who were there during this time when the hillside went through a lengthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| complicated, and very controversial process, when it was adopted into a policy, not an ordinance or a law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2867)|
| 0:47:55| that they request that hillside be removed completely from recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| that this is a huge break of the public trust to try and slip in a policy into the recode process and make it a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| And I totally understand that position, and I'm here to support that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Taking hillside out of recode does not take hillside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| It's still there in its current state as a policy to be used by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2892)|
| 0:48:18| There's a lot of unanswered questions to hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| It's a half-page text in recode, whether it applies to residential, commercial, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| It's a 95-page binder in its current state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| I can't get a lot of questions answered from city staff and city legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| and that's not their fault, on how hillside would be applied as it is written in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| There are too many unanswered questions to do what a lot of commissioners have said here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| is to make thoughtful, informed decisions for the good of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Hillside was vetted on its own under the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| It was not vetted under recode standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Take it out of recode, let the stakeholder committee vet it on its own after recode, if it's adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| and look at it so that we can make the best decisions so it can do what we really want it to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Danny Kirby, 3035 Port Royal Lane, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2959)|
| 0:49:26| Just to touch on what Mr. Kelly said a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and one of the comments about sort of everybody being latecomers to this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| I'm not sure everybody would be latecomers to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| had city council not amended the zoning ordinance in November of last year to skirt the public notice requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| There are clearly public notice requirements that were stated in the amendment section of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| and in November of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| MPC made a recommendation to approve an amendment to send it to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| that basically told them you don't have to send notice to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| Every other developer that comes in here, a notice has to go out to the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| So to say, well, everybody's kind of late to the game, well, that's because you tried to skirt the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| So never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| That was part of my statements later on, but I wanted to go ahead and touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Never mind, too, that there's three versions of the fifth draft that are on the recode website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3022)|
| 0:50:30| I think you all approved the fourth draft and sent it to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| Then it was posted as a final draft, and then everybody got up in arms and said, final draft? Are you kidding me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| There was a special called meeting for a Tuesday afternoon at 3 o'clock to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| Everybody raised cane, and then they stopped and went, oh, no, no, we'll turn this into a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| So then they did another draft after that one, another draft after that one, and then this draft come out Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| So not only in terms of commission having the opportunity to review these changes, what about the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| This draft wasn't even posted until Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| And, again, it's 400 pages. There's 70-something changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| That's probably just between the fifth drafts. I'm not even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| And even in the fifth draft, there was blue line versions coming out of the fourth draft that nobody really is sure whether those got voted on at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3076)|
| 0:51:25| like some of the other amendments that got piled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| So I question not just commission's ability to interpret a lot of these changes, but the public as well needs to understand those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3088)|
| 0:51:38| They need more time than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| You all are familiar with this information, this type of stuff, and the language that gets used in these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| The public is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| And to say that we're going to post a draft on Friday and vote on it the following Thursday, whether it give executive order of some kind or not, that's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3107)|
| 0:51:58| But I'll go on because I've just got a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| Number one, I never thought this ordinance, the recode, was necessary to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| A zoning ordinance is made to live and breathe with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| This ordinance that we have right now has lived and breathed with the city of Knoxville for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| It's produced a great city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| And it has flexed with Cumberland Avenue, with the South Waterfront, with some downtown developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| And it can flex a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| But to go to the lengths that we're going to completely break a new ordinance out of a box, set it down over a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| and rezone every property in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| never mind the fact that if my property has been in compliance with the one-year plan for the last 20 years, why do I lose rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| Why am I losing uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| That's just a question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| So, philosophically, I don't think this process is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Now, here we are, two, three years later, 80, 90 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Gerald, if there's 90 meetings, there's 40 or so listed on the recode website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| I don't know where the details are for the other 40 or 50 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| In my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| Okay, well, then the public ought to have access to that information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| They can have it any time they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Should it not be on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| I'm sorry if you're upset, Gerald, that we're having this conversation, but that's a legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| It is, and I answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| I will also say that there were a couple of three goals for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| For it to be simpler, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| You can go to the C6 section right here, and it's got all my regulations in four pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| Area, setbacks, everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| To use this ordinance, I've got to go to no less than seven sections, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| The way to use it, the application process, is Chapter 15 back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| So it's not an easier ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| More uses permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| We were told there were going to be more permitted uses by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Because we've asked for a commercial comparison table ad nauseum and still can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| And I don't know how you think that in this matrix type system you're going to have more permitted uses by right than a hierarchical system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3237)|
| 0:54:06| Never mind the fact that you're going to talk about improving residential and protecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| You took away duplex rights, apartment rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| and you're going to stick group homes and domestic violence shelters and public safety facilities in every single zone in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, Mr. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| You're welcome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3261)|
| 0:54:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| I'm here on behalf of Community Forum to speak about the proposed revision to the draft recode ordinance for Section 8.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| Hillside Protection Overlay Zoning District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| The proposed revision by planning staff seeks to apply the hillside protection overlay regulations only to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| This proposed revision was made public yesterday, June the 12th, and comes after some discussion at the agenda review meeting on June 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3298)|
| 0:55:07| Community Forum has provided responses to each of the five drafts of recode and specifically has addressed this issue in great detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3307)|
| 0:55:16| The language proposed in recode has changed in each draft since it was first included in draft two when the overlay would only apply to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3316)|
| 0:55:27| In draft three and draft four, the overlay applied to all properties, which is what you all approved in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| Because you all approved after draft four had come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| And I apologize, I forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Just correcting the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| At the special meeting of City Council on May 14th, after considerable discussion by City Council and Mayor Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| City Council voted 7-2 to revise draft five so that the HP overlay district would apply to all lots in all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3352)|
| 0:56:05| I think I left out the sentence that draft five, when draft five was changed once again to apply only to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| So City Council went back and says, no, we'd like it to be all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| There's quite a history about the hillside protection plan, and it is detailed in our previous responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| But I would like to give just a brief summary as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| The hillside slope protection plan was adopted by City Council in 2011 and incorporated into the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3387)|
| 0:56:36| The hillside and slope protection plan was the result of over two years of work by citizens, MPC, and city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| The plan was not codified but was enforced through the planned residential and planned commercial and shopping center zoning districts in the existing Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3404)|
| 0:56:55| It has been enforced on commercial property and, for example, MPC proposed in 2017 rezoning property from C-4 to planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3415)|
| 0:57:04| in order to deal with the steep slopes for a freight terminal proposal in East Knoxville at Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| RECODE deletes both the planned residential, planned commercial, and shopping center zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| which are the vehicles used to enforce hillside and slope protection plan through their use on review development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| That is why the hillside protection provisions have been added to RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| A decision was made a year ago that RECODE would be the best vehicle to codify the hillside and slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| And that is why it was put in Draft 2 last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| We ask that you follow the guidance provided by City Council at their special called Council Meeting on May 14, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3462)|
| 0:57:51| to leave in place RECODE that hillside and slope protection provisions would apply to all properties in the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3471)|
| 0:58:00| And I thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3483)|
| 0:58:17| Okay, I don't see anyone else from the audience. I don't see any lights on. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| I wanted to ask a question about was the final draft of this, was that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| It was just delivered like on Friday or made available to the public last Friday. Is that true or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| I'm asking. I'm not insinuating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| And I'm trying to remember. I know we posted on the Planning Commission website the final draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3516)|
| 0:58:44| On the RECODE, it was earlier than that on the RECODE website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Okay. I just, I'm still, I think we're heading in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| I just, some of these things that were said concern me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| I mean, I just want to abide by some sense of fair play with regard to, in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| I think there were some statements that need some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| All property owners have been notified, were notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| and we received a number of phone calls and comments in response to that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| Again, I mentioned that we apologize for not having completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| but we're doing graphs and explanations of the, or charts and explanations of the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| and what that zoning would be proposed under RECODE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| There's very little rezoning. It's an equivalent zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| It's changing to the most equivalent zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| And most of the, Mr. Kirby made a good point about C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| That does have all the standards in one zoning district, but they're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| You're, if Commissioner Hill owned a piece of property that were zoned C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and next door was a property zoned C4, all the standards would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| He'd be looking all over the place. It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| We're trying to make the standards more consistent for all zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| My neighbor is an example, the person I mentioned who has to wait forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| and go through variances to do the type of development that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| The code, our existing code works in particular situations from a citywide standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Again, instead of looking through our own lens of self-interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| we have to look at the city as a whole and what is beneficial to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| And that's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Is the code perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| No, I would make it a lot different than if it were for my self-interest and my own perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| But for the benefit of the community as a whole, I think it works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| I mentioned the codification of the provision that you could request equivalent zoning for no fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3639)|
| 1:00:49| and staff would review those very leniently, and I'm sure council would, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| There's also an ordinance that's being proposed by Councilmember Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| to keep the stakeholder committee in place for two years to review the implementation of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| and to recommend revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| That's the purview of this commission also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| Our existing code is contradictory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| It doesn't place the same standards on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| It's a code that was put in place at a certain time and maintains the standards of that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| and that results in, again, I drive home going north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| so I see Regents Bank at the corner of Broadway and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| It doesn't match with the rest of that area because of the suburban template| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| that our current code places on the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| We have templates for West Hills now that are more in keeping with West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| We have templates for North Hills that are more in keeping with North Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| We've got templates for our near downtown corridors that are more in keeping with the character of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| and allow more intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| We've got templates for Turkey Creek that allow a more suburban-style development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| So we're trying to address the type of development that has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| make everything as equal as possible, but allow new development in keeping with the historic character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| of the community and allowing a bit more intensive uses along our corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| It concerns me about the notice that was waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| It concerns me if the draft wasn't out until late last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| in terms of how much attention is on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| I would support a 30-day postponement, but I'm not trying to make anybody mad or get in the way of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| I think we ought to consider, you know, how the appearance...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| And I don't get mad, I get passionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| It looks a little mad there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| And the notice did go to every property owner, and I can't even remember when that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| I know we spent a good deal of time answering phone calls at least a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| maybe three months or more ago, it was some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| The revised draft was posted on May 30th, which is two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| I know that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| And that was very clear that the proposed amendment, it's a document that you have to keep watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3785)|
| 1:03:14| It does change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| That's a challenge with the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| The draft changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| There was a May 30th version posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Mr. Kirby, if someone, if a commissioner wants to hear from you, they'll call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| But we're at commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Is it quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Well, I'm just going to say, there was a May 14th version, fifth draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| There's a May 30th version, fifth draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And then there's the draft that was posted on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| I even talked to council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| I was questioning where the latest draft was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| And a council member even said to me, they told us in the meeting it would be posted by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| And it was posted on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| You know, I would say that we sent this once to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| And what I would like to see from our group here is if there are things that change specifically that make us uneasy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3841)|
| 1:04:12| then let's talk about those, you know, if it's line item by line item, and then send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Most of what we sent back we okayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| You know, there are a number of safeguards when we send this back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| We have the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| We've had council was asked to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| Each council person was asked to review the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| And if they had issues, they represent each district, and some represent the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| So this is going to be ever evolving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| And then, you know, we pass this 30 days from now, and there will be some more revisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| and then we'll say, well, that's late notice again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| And every time you make a change, you'll say, well, it's late notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| So we'll never get to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| And so if there are specific things, if it's the hillside protection that gives this body an issue, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| I'd be willing to revise a motion and set it aside and then send the document up, except that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| So I would certainly like to hear from other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| I think Mr. Kirby made some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| I got my notice almost a month and a half, two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| So I live in the city, and then got six other phone calls of people that live in the city that got their notices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| which I told them to call Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| And I enjoyed talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I really just disagreed with notifying every single property owner in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| But when I got my notice, I thought, well, that probably was the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| And Mr. Kirby made that point, and I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| He also made the point that we have a 50-year-old zoning code that has expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3960)|
| 1:06:09| It's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| It's been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| It's served us well for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| Let's put some Bondo, put some paint on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| This is going to serve us well for another 50 years, but it needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| There are some very positive, positive things that this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| There's a lot of contention with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| But it's a big step in the right direction, and we were making changes to the zoning regulations last year, the 50-year-old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=3992)|
| 1:06:42| I don't think this is, in every situation, it's going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| I could support pulling Hillside out of it, but I see the wisdom in the Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| I wanted Knox County to adopt the Hillside Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| I'll stare out my – every time I leave my office, I'll look at a huge example of what would not have happened if they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4019)|
| 1:07:08| I don't – we spent a lot of time on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| It is a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Like I said, I could probably support this without it, but I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| I don't know that – what was said is a vehicle for approving and codifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| There is some wisdom in that as well, so I'll probably support this motion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4045)|
| 1:07:33| And Hillside Protection would be on and off for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| I think it's – there's wisdom either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| But as far as keep kicking it down the road, this is what we did with Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| I mean, it literally got to the point where nobody wanted to hear Hillside and slope protection anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| We spend a lot of time. We spend a lot of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| If we postpone it, we could have a lot more workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| I wouldn't have to go home and work in the yard and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| But if we approve it, I think it would be better for everyone in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| It's a starting point, and it's not going to be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| But I think in the long run, it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you. Commissioner Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| I agree with Commissioner Clancy, Commissioner Burson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| I think we need to move ahead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| There are things I don't agree with wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| But overall, I think it's really important for us to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| One thing I want to clarify is that I have been at at least 30 different meetings with groups all across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4116)|
| 1:08:45| beginning with the first meeting that was ever had on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| I've been actively involved in reading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| I've read the last draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| I've read all of the changes that have been proposed and agree with most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| But I don't have to agree with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| The document as a whole, I think, is ready to go ahead, and let's send it back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| Thank you. Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| I'm a supporter of the Hillside and Steepslope Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| I'd like to see it across all the zones, but I understand the logic in keeping it as it's currently written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| and we've been addressing the other zones in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| And I do think it's time that we vote on this and take these changes and send it back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4172)|
| 1:09:42| Okay. I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I don't see anyone from the audience that wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| We do have a motion by Commissioner Hill, a second by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| to recommend that we pass RECODE on to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| I'm not going to read the whole motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| We've got three noes. Could you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Three noes. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| Oh, four noes. I'm sorry. Missed you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you all for your input, and I believe that city council is going to be looking forward to hearing from your input again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4221)|
| 1:10:30| So we're going to move on to agenda item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4230)|
| 1:10:43| The subdivision is Tenova Medical Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| The applicant is Tenova Medical Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| The location is the south side of Middlebrook Pike, west side of Old Weisgarber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Approximate acreage is 108.17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| The zoning is A1 General Agricultural and O1 Office Medical and Related Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| Proposed use is a medical office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Number of lots is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| Staff recommendation is to postpone the concept plan to the July 11, 2019, Planning Commission meeting as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4279)|
| 1:11:28| Applicant is requesting approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| And before we go to the applicant and or opposition, I'd like to hear from Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| So as was mentioned, this is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| With concept plans, prominently what we're looking at is lot layout, so number of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| how they're arranged on the property, and any type of public improvements that need to be made to provide access to those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| or any type of improvements that need to be made to other public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| So in this case, they are proposing a new road system that's private to service the office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| It will connect into Middlebrook Pike, which is a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| They will need to make improvements to the Dow Springs and Middlebrook intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| They've done a traffic impact study that outlines what those improvements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| They'll need to create turn lanes on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| And the other entrance to their site is just a right in, right out, so there's no major modifications there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4353)|
| 1:12:43| Just wanted to also point out, since we're only looking at lots and roads improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4363)|
| 1:12:53| we aren't looking at uses that are permitted on the property at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| with the exception that the traffic impact study that was created does have to outline uses that they think will end up on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4377)|
| 1:13:09| So when you see the staff report, it mentions that there are certain numbers of uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| like number of beds of a hospital and how much medical office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| square feet of medical office space there may be in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| That's just an assumption through the traffic impact study process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| It's not something that will necessarily be constructed on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| but it is part of their process to determine what kind of improvements do need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| They typically will pick the worst case scenario for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| what they think might be the most intense that they will develop the site at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| so that they make all the improvements now that they think need to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| and not put a use on there later on that will then require them to rip up part of what they did and redo something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4433)|
| 1:14:05| I provided before the meeting some recommended conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4445)|
| 1:14:13| If the commission does choose to move forward with approval this month, you should have it on a white sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4453)|
| 1:14:21| There's 11 conditions. There's nothing in there that is really a major change to what they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| It's mainly just trying to make sure that the development gets put in the way that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| and the applicant has been discussing through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| And just to clarify, I know I'm repeating what you've already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| but this is a concept and we are not looking at what the development plan will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| That will be coming before the commission at a later time. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| Individual sites, this property is zoned 01. It's an office medical park zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| There's a lot of uses that are permitted by right, and those uses, if they propose some of those uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| they will just go through the permitting process. They won't come back before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| If they propose a use that's a use permitted on review, then it will come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| A hospital is one of those uses that would need to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| I'm not sure if any of the proposed uses will be considered a hospital by the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| because there's a difference between what the traffic impact study land use classifications are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| I can't remember how many beds off the top of my head it was that they said that they were going to potentially have on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| But what they call a hospital by the traffic impact study may not be what the zoning ordinance calls a hospital, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| We may or may not see any of the developments come back to this body after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| In other words, this may be the only opportunity for public input. Is that what I'm hearing? Or a public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| Yes, it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Sir, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Wayne Klein, 617 Main Street. I'm here on behalf of your applicant, Tenova Medical Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| This is simply a concept plan, and there is no intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| And if you read the traffic study, you may get the misimpression that it's going to be a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| All that's going to be out there right now on one of the lots is a rehabilitation facility with 57 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| We've met all the requirements of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| We've met with Mr. Reynolds, and I think we've satisfied all the requirements for a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| And as far as Mr. Reynolds' suggested conditions, if you do approve, we have no problem with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4610)|
| 1:16:57| But I do have people here. I have our engineer, Mr. Salisbury, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| In case you have questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| I will defer my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Sir, you're in opposition. Would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| John Hines, 6908 Stockton Drive, Knoxville, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| I'm here on behalf of the Wesley Neighbors Community Association and the West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| about 1,200-plus residents, households, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| And this is a big deal for us, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| I've dealt with Tenova in the past, and we're actually not against the 57-bed residence plan that Tenova has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| In fact, they've been very communicative toward us, to us, back and forth about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| However, the thing that I'm opposing today is we just received this traffic study on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| I think it was submitted on Monday after the deadline, and I guess our first look at it was Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| And so we're requesting a delay, a postponement, just to give us time to review the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| I think it's 200-300 pages long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| And I think engineering and your planning professionals are recommending a postponement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4693)|
| 1:18:22| So we would like to ask for that postponement so those guys, your paid professionals, can look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| so we can look at it, so TDOT can look at it, city engineering can also look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| Just go through that document, see what the details are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| So we think that's a small ask for something that's going to affect our community, our little neighborhood, for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4718)|
| 1:18:48| So that's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Mike, we approved this for a hospital a couple years ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4735)|
| 1:19:04| That's correct, in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Did they do a traffic study at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| And what they're proposing is less intense than a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| And that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| And Mr. Kline, you have a copy of these 11 conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| And you all are all right with all 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| We're fine with all 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4767)|
| 1:19:32| We're talking about a less intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| We've debated the hospital at least three meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| and postponed those two and three times so that the neighborhood could get their head wrapped around the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4779)|
| 1:19:48| how it was going to work, ambulances, traffic impact studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| That's all been done, and this is a less intense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to these 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| Commissioner Phillips, would you like to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| No, I'd agree with Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| This is a less intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| We've already approved a 300-bed hospital in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| I don't see any conditions change that would make me change my view of this project, so I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4816)|
| 1:20:29| Commissioner Eason, I just have a question about the intensity of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| because you said it was a 300-bed hospital previously, but this has two potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| In terms of the traffic study, it looks like it may be a more intense amount of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| For staff, that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Is it more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| The previous 2013 included a 300-bed hospital and 100 square feet of medical office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4853)|
| 1:21:03| So by their number, by the traffic impact study, the new one, they do have a little bit less beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4863)|
| 1:21:12| but they do have quite a bit more office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| But what I'm not sure about, and I was looking at their 2013 plan earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| but they didn't show any uses on a good portion of the site as part of the hospital project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| and I don't know if that 100,000 square feet of professional office space or medical office space was on the hospital site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4887)|
| 1:21:37| which I think it was, or on what was shown as vacant land for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| My guess was that it did not include that other land for future development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| so there's probably a good chance that eventually it would have equaled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| or gone more than what they're proposing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4913)|
| 1:22:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| Mike, so it's a new concept plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| So it could have different traffic patterns and different peak flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| and so that's why you want to have time to see the traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| Yeah, we got the revised traffic impact studies kind of late in our review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| so we haven't had a chance to fully vet the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| I think we're either in revision three or four on the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| so we're getting to the parts of the revision process where it's getting to be a little bit more minute in what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| It's not big-scale issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| There are a couple of smaller issues that need to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| So at this point, the engineering departments, TDOT, the city engineering planning staff in our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4962)|
| 1:22:50| just haven't had a chance to get through all of that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Is this the first submittal of this concept plan, or has this been bouncing around a few times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| The concept plan itself, I got this revision Monday or Tuesday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| Now, the concept plan itself, the actual plan, like the lot layout and the road layout, hasn't really changed a ton over the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4986)|
| 1:23:14| It's been refined, especially like the Middlebrook and Dallas Springs intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| That's been refined, especially in this last version, so that it functions better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| And just some of the internal road layout changed a little bit, but really the lots themselves and everything have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5006)|
| 1:23:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Commissioner Ruff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| In regards to the traffic study requirements, aren't we dealing with that with items two and three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| Three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| And four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| We're saying if we approve this, if we move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| we're saying they have to abide by the traffic study that was done in May of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| and they have to abide by TDOT's rules and Knox County's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Aren't we dealing with that, with those three conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| I think we're dealing with it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| So I don't see any reason why we would have to go back and postpone it again to rehash that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| because we're saying you have to abide by these revisions, these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| Commissioner Paz, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| Did you change your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Yeah, I was going to make the same point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| It says revising the traffic impact study before permitting new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| I mean, that pretty much gives them, they don't issue a permit until they've had time to revise and study the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5077)|
| 1:24:47| So I just don't see the wisdom in kicking it down the road for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| All right, we have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| On to agenda number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5118)|
| 1:25:27| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| This is a concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Subdivision is Rather Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| The applicant is, or developer, is John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| The location is the southeast side of Rather Road, east of George Light Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| Approximate acreage is 7.84 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| The existing land use is rural residential with the proposed use of attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| Number of lots is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| There are three subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| The staff recommendation, there will be three motions, three votes on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| First is the staff recommendation to approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| because the site's topography and shape restricts compliance with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Second motion and vote is to approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| And the third is to approve the development plan for up to 26 attached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| on individual lots and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| adjacent to lots 13 through 15 subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| I see one person in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Sir, do you want to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| I'll let the opposition go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Jerry Anderson, 10518 Rather Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| To be in context, it's a property adjacent to the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| I'm not really sure what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| This is the first time I've ever done anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| I'm not sure if this is to approve it or if it's just part of the initial process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| because there are concerns about the property development next to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| A couple of years ago, they put in a subdivision across the road from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Since then, we have had greatly increased traffic and flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| which goes right past the road in front of my house and on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| And I'm afraid that any further development on this will increase that flooding even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| that could even put my house and property at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| A few other concepts that you talked about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| was the traffic trying to get out onto Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| which is already getting pretty hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| and that they're going to do a possible no left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| like they've done on a few of the other roads on Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| which means that most of that traffic is going to try to go out through Rather Road to Higdon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| to get to Oak Ridge Highway, which is less than 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Two cars can hardly pass on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| To increase the traffic without increasing the size of that continuous road would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| And there's also, I haven't talked to anybody from this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| This started out as a subdivision with individual houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| and now it's at condos because they're trying to compact it farther to get the same number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| And I take issue with the property lines that they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| that is way farther east than what my original boundaries were when I bought the property 19 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| And, again, nobody from the company has talked to me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| so I don't know where the process goes from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| If you have any recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| You say that their property, tell me about your concerns about your property boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| I'm not sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| Yes, on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Before, even by the websites of the planning commission that we looked at two or three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5369)|
| 1:29:37| when the first developer was coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| our property line matched the west side of the other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5379)|
| 1:29:47| but then somehow they realigned the property lines to now it's towards the west of that property across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| And that's not where my original evaluation was when I bought the property many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5394)|
| 1:30:04| And I even talked to the surveyors that were out there last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| and their little pink markers just don't match up with what they're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| The only reason I can think of for this thing being farther down onto my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| is for the proposed realignment of that curved road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| They need part of my property to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| Again, I don't know how I go about disputing it, but I will if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| Ask him something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| Are you disputing what it looks like on the website, online, or an actual survey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Okay, because that is not going to be accurate like a survey will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| I've had properties before where the line was on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| It appeared it was really close to a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| But in reality, if you have a boundary dispute, you probably need to get a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| I wouldn't rely or take that to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| So, again, this is the first time I've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| I don't even know where they're at in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| because that little yellow sign just came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| different from the sign that was there two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| And we were told before anything really happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| the developers were supposed to contact property owners, and that's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| So, again, I'm not sure where I'm supposed to go from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| The planning staff encourages developers to contact the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| That's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| They encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| It is a requirement to post the sign, which you saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5493)|
| 1:31:39| I'd like to ask county engineering with regards to do you have confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5499)|
| 1:31:46| that there is going to be a right turn only from, what is it, George Light Road onto Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5506)|
| 1:31:54| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| That would be a State Department of Transportation decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| Well, it's in the documentation that it's a possibility going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| That's the only reason I even thought about it is I actually read what was sent to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| I think that as far as what your questions are right now is specifically your property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5534)|
| 1:32:22| which you're going to do some sort of survey, have some sort of survey to ensure what your property line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| Did you have another question that needed to be answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| I'm just wondering what's going to happen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| What's going to happen today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| I've never seen this process before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| I'll try to give an overview, and we'll ask other staff to supplement what I will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| This is a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| It's a first step in approval of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| The concept plan, if approved, would then be taken by the engineer and the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| and a design plan prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| That design plan would lay out the roads, utilities, stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Again, this plan we have now is exactly what it's termed, a conceptual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| That design plan would be detailed with regard to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| The design plan would be submitted to the Knox County Engineering and Public Works for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| and assurance that it complies with the county standards for roads, for stormwater, et cetera, grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| Upon approval of that concept plan, the developer would be issued permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5606)|
| 1:33:34| to start grading and construction of the infrastructure, the roads, any utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| the stormwater management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| At that point, the applicant or the developer could submit bonds to ensure completion of that infrastructure or complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5624)|
| 1:33:53| If bonds are provided to ensure completion of the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| a final plat would be submitted for review and approval by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| although the staff is working towards, I've forgotten if that amendment were approved or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| Yes, August 6th would be when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| August 6th, the staff would have the authority to approve final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| So this is the time for public comment and review and assurance that that concept plan is in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5655)|
| 1:34:23| with the standards of the zoning ordinance and any other, primarily the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| because getting into the design plan with the engineering would be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| So this is the appropriate time to address the questions that you've asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| The one that we can address, as Commissioner Smith said, with regard to your boundary line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| that's the best way to determine the precise location of that is through a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| And I would reiterate what Commissioner Smith said, that the maps as shown on KGIS are not always correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| But thank you for coming and becoming part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| It's educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| And I'll tell everyone in this room, I guess it's good from the county standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| but it's scary also that if you have vacant property next to you, expect to attend one of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5711)|
| 1:35:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Applicant, do you have something that you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| Yes, I'm Garrett Tucker with Robert Campbell and Associates, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5726)|
| 1:35:35| I'll just mention a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| We were kind of surprised with the property ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| It was a little different than what KGIS showed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| and actually that's kind of part of the reason that we needed to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| That, coupled with the topography, was one of the reasons that we were trying to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| make the project work financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| We are improving Rather Road, starting at George Light Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| going all the way up past our property all the way around to the next property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| which is quite a bit of expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| We're partnering with the county on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| We're giving up almost half an acre of our property to help make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| to fix that terrible curve that goes around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5776)|
| 1:36:24| We'll be glad to meet with the adjoining owners and work out any boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| We found existing pens, existing fence lines and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| so we feel pretty comfortable with the boundary line, but it doesn't agree with KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5793)|
| 1:36:43| Let's see, the only other thing I'll mention is on the drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| that it's going to drain pretty much straight through Beaver Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| so we shouldn't have any trouble with the drainage or hurting the adjoining owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5809)|
| 1:36:59| I think that's about all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| After looking this over, I think with the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| and I think a development based on what we've got so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| if you go to, I mean, if they hit the engineering standards that they have to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| I think, Mr. Anderson, I think your flooding problems will only abate somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| and nobody ever can tell you that for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| but I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| because the site's topography shape restricts compliance with subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| and proposed variances is not a created traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve variances one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Motion to approve the concept plan subject to the eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| I'd like to make a comment before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| These are private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Is that what we're approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| My comment is private roads tend to become public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5904)|
| 1:38:31| They're expensive to maintain, and once they start falling apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| they call on the county to make them public roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| and unless it's a gated community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| I have a real problem with approving private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| You're talking about the roads that are within the development as private roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| I just wanted to ask Leo, this is private roads you still inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| and make people build to public road standards now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Yes, we do, as far as pavement depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| And we've got a pretty rigid requirements in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| They have to be built pretty much to public road standards in order to be accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| These roads are we recently used to be 26 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| Subdivision regs recently require, even for public roads, allow narrower roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| I understand that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| but roads do deteriorate after a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| and at some point when the people realize how much it costs to repave that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| or resurface whatever, then they come to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| and want them to take them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| That's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Yes, we do an inspection before we would take them over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| and they'd have to be pretty well up to snuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| It does become expensive to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6027)|
| 1:40:29| We have a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| for up to 26 detached dwelling units on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| adjacent to lots 13 and 15, subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| We're moving right along to agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6060)|
| 1:41:12| The subdivision is Glenn Roth's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| Applicant developer is Stephen Maddox, Maddox Companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| Location, west side of Triplett Lane, south of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| Zoning is PR planned residential, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Existing land use is residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| The number of lots is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| Three subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| This will be three motions, three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| Motion and vote one is to deny variance one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| based on the comments identified below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| Motion and vote two is postpone action on variances two and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| and the concept plan until a revised plan is submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| addressing the double frontage lot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| And vote number three would be postpone action on review approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| until a revised plan is submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| addressing the double frontage lot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| We have several in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| Sir, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| Okay, I see three hands that raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| Do you folks have a spokesperson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| or do you all want to split the five-minute time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| Are you going to split or do you have a spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| I guess we'll split it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| I don't know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| I'll keep an eye on the time for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| I'm Phillip Royer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| I live at 322 Triplett, and I've been there 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| and most of my neighbors have been there longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| It's a quiet, rural neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| and yet all of the properties on Triplett Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| are within a half mile of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| We like it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| and when planning states that density of seven dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| is appropriate for the Glenroth property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| because it's within 1,000 feet of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| we're uncomfortable with that, and we disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| I'm not here to talk about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| I want to comment on the ill effects of such a density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| and they're exhibited by the proposed Glenroth site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| High density propels the developer to cram as many lots on the property as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| even if they must violate ordinance for setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| specifically the double frontage setbacks for lots on the western edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| High density leads to lots that are so small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| that houses have to be tightly regimented and stacked like dominoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| fronts all aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Fifty to 60-foot lot widths leads to houses with no sidewall windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| and side yards just big enough to push a lawnmower through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| Small lots lead to a lack of significant shade trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| This Glenroth development would be 11 times as dense as the neighborhood that it's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6262)|
| 1:44:29| even if you include all of Franklin Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| In regard to traffic on triplet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| density at Glenroth will cause an increase in congestion and endanger current users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| counting all the residents using triplet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| including a significant number of Franklin Hill residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| Glenroth poses more than a 40% increase in daily trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| It's no wonder that a traffic study was not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| The effects are obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| In order to gain as many lots as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| the developer is asking for two driveway connections, not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| The developer will probably claim that triplet lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| has access to a traffic signal at Kingston Park, which is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| Even a left turn from triplet into the suicide lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| is preferable to winding through more than 100 yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| of a private shopping center parking lot at Franklin Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| Glenroth will increase dangerous vehicle-pedestrian interactions at Franklin Square crossings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| I'm an architect, not a residential developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| and I favor redevelopment of this neglected property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| but I would argue that Glenroth would be a much nicer place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| with fewer parcels, larger yards, less traffic, and a better relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6347)|
| 1:45:53| You've already used three minutes, and we've got two other people that would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6359)|
| 1:46:09| I'm Brenda Walker Crider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| I live at 9701 Franklin Hill Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| That's at the corner of Triplet and Franklin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| That's a nice street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| It's a nice area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| And like you said, we're very, very close to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| But when you come down Triplet to try to get onto Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| you really do have to go through the shopping center, Franklin Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| and then out on their light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| So if you come down Triplet and you try to go across the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| you really can't because the traffic is significant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6403)|
| 1:46:47| And the cars coming down through here can't make that turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| I have to go through the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| But if you go down through there and you turn to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| you run into the back of the Chick-fil-A extra line that's right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| You may know where that is on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| And if you turn in the turn lane to turn back up Triplet like you're coming home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| there will be someone trying to get in the turn lane right there to go down by the Hibachi Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| So you kind of know where the area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| It's already congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| Now, we need a traffic study, and we need another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| And I think there's some rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| You can't have a light and a half a block have another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| I don't really know what you could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Now, that area does need to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| They've got coyotes in there, and we saw a bear a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| So we need that fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| But we'd like to have lots there, very much like Franklin Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| so that it would maintain the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| But something needs to be done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| I saw one other hand raised with regards to opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| Currently, we've got 18 seconds on the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Sir, do you have a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| I'd just like to reiterate that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| Sir, come to the microphone and name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| I'm Dwight Crider, the husband of the lady that was just here, 9701 Franklin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| I'd just like to reiterate exactly what's been said in support of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Good afternoon, Commission, staff, and directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Steve Maddox, 101 Dalton Placeway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6524)|
| 1:48:52| I actually have lived there 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| So I remember when the first closest red light was Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| I hate to date myself, but times are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| And a lot of the new policies are that we try to condense properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| and get the housing in there like the people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| When we decided that we were going to first turn in for the rezoning and the sector amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| I went out to this property and put up an eight-foot, four-foot by eight-foot sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| that had all my contact information on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| had a rendering of a typical house like we're talking about building in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| and the site plan at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| We turned in for rezoning for seven units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| During that period of time, I met three times now with the Franklin Hills Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| and the Board of Directors for the Franklin Hills, twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| and told everybody what our plans was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| And the reason I put that sign out there was so that I didn't have a way to contact people up and down Triplett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| but they could see my sign and contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| So I've done everything I can to talk to everybody in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| And this opposition has just come about in the last very few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Now, I started out with seven units per acre is what I asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6617)|
| 1:50:24| Then we cut back to 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| And now we're back to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| I'm sorry, lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| Now we're back to 26 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| And what's happened is we have currently about 15 people that have contacted us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| a big majority of them out of the Franklin Hills area and Seven Oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| and different subdivisions right there that have heard about our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| that want to downsize from 6,000 and 7,000 square foot homes to smaller homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| We originally thought that these homes would be around 2,500 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| a two-car garage and everything, and that's the reason we started off with the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| We found that since then that several people want 3,500 square foot lots, houses or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| And so we have tried to expand the lots as much as we could to be able to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| Not a single person wants a big yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| Not a single person wants to maintain or do anything with the outside of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| or their yards or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| They want an association to maintain it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| In the notes here it mentions that it's going to be served by a new public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| That was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| It's going to be a private road built to the Knox County standards, gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6693)|
| 1:51:40| And so all the people that are interested in here, that's exactly what they are wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| And the lots are small from what I would typically call my standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| but from what the people are wanting these days, this is exactly what they're wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| I'd like to address, if I may, the comments by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| I was unable to make it to a couple of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| I had to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| But the staff has recommended that the setbacks, I asked for 15 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| and they've recommended a 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6732)|
| 1:52:16| I am in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I think that would be a good thing for us to do all the way around the property, so I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| The one that I have a problem with is the back line where they're talking about a double-sided lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| And I understand the purpose of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| That's to keep somebody from driving down the back of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| looking into the backyard and seeing, you know, whatever, playgrounds or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6757)|
| 1:52:43| The back line of this property, which fronts on Franklin Hills Boulevard right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| is very densely vegetated at this time, large trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| And then we're going to go in there on our side of this dense vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| and we're actually going to enhance the vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| and we're going to add a six-foot high totally opaque privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| Every single person that I talk to, and I mean 25 or 30 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| in the Franklin Square, Franklin Hills that's going to be driving by that, love our idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| They're all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| That's the reason none of them are here opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| They're all for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| So I understand the purpose of this 150-foot depth of lots when you can see through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6801)|
| 1:53:29| but this is basically not a two-sided lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| It's actually just a one-sided lot that's going to be served by our private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| Behind that, it's going to be totally blocked off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| so nobody's going to be able to see in from the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| And the entire development's going to be fenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| Mr. Breschko, do you have ñ oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| I just had a quick question for Mr. Maddox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Regarding the vegetation and the privacy fence that you would put at the rear of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| would there be an agreement with the Homeowners Association to maintain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| or would that be subject to the individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| Well, they maintain on their side now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| We're actually ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| I mean your new community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Total Homeowners Association, it's going to maintain all the yards, all the vegetation, the roads, the gates, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| even the exterior of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| Mr. Breschko, do you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| Too many of us pushing the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| Just a clarification on a couple items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| The rezoning request did recommend an approval of PR zoning up to seven dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| The actual density of the plan that's before the Planning Commission for the concept approval is 4.64,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6885)|
| 1:54:52| so it's within the low-density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| That actually will be before, I believe, the County Commission in June 24th for an action on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6897)|
| 1:55:06| And the issue on the ñ well, a couple things were raised today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and I think it would even support why we would recommend that this be postponed to the next meeting to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| The plans we have is for public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| There were some unique designs on the corner radiuses and stuff on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| that would take some extra review by county engineering for public streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6925)|
| 1:55:33| but we did not receive this as a private street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| The issue of the double frontage lots, when that was approved over a year ago, there was a depth of 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| When the Planning Commission considered the subregs the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| and what was adopted and recommended for implementation on August 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| there were some additional options on double frontage on a local street instead of 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| The recommendation was 135 feet in depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| We would recommend supporting the 135 if this were acted on before that officially goes into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| but another option I think may be more appropriate to look at in this case is if theyíre looking at ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| and that dense vegetation you can see, and if you go on Google, you can see that row of trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| but I think itís pretty much a single row of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| And if theyíre looking at supplementing it, they can look at creating a common area strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| that would include the existing vegetation, the fence line, and the additional vegetation theyíre proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6992)|
| 1:56:39| and then you donít have the restriction on the lot depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| If you put that common area strip between there and the double frontage goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7003)|
| 1:56:48| But I think staff would like to see that plan as to whatís being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| And again, I think that would support our reason why we would like to see this postponed for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| to try to iron out these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| Yeah, Iíve been down there and looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| You know, currently weíre building homes on lots this size, and theyíre very popular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7029)|
| 1:57:16| I have a lot of respect for Mr. Maddox and what heís done with the shopping centers down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| And, you know, I think that this could be a very, very nice project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7041)|
| 1:57:26| and the 115 foot of lot depth I think is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| Weíre doing this in areas of town all over, and theyíre really hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| People really like that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| This is a good buffer, I think, between the shopping center and the larger homes on up Triplett Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7059)|
| 1:57:48| So Iím not bothered by this myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| Iíll make a motion that we approve variances one through three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7071)|
| 1:57:59| That would be my motion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Let me, if I may add, the engineer on the projectís here also, and heís listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| and so any changes that are agreed to by the commission here, he can have that drawn and turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7087)|
| 1:58:19| Commissioner, we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| We do not yet have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| We do have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Are you okay if we get some more comments before weó| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| Okay. Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| Well, I would agree with Mr. Smithís assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| On Tuesday we talked about this particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| and we talked about it being a master plan, complete community with maintenance free, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7117)|
| 1:58:46| We didnít know at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| And we talked internally that if that buffer was preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| and there was a supplement to the buffer and it wasnít being asked to be reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| and it wasnít being thoughtful and planned, there definitely was some merit to the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| So Iím going to echo Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| What I donít find here are any conditions of approval similarly to what we did for Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7149)|
| 1:59:18| So I would be all for trying to approve something, but I donít have a list of conditions to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| So Iím not sure if weíre prepared to do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| Thank you. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| I would echo the same thoughts as Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| This is a property that needs to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| It really is the kind of style of homes and lots that people are looking for these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7182)|
| 1:59:51| We certainly want to be considerate to the people that live on Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| Theyíve been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| They have beautiful houses with really large yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| But as Mr. Maddox said, times are changing, and this area really needs inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| This area needs homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| And weíre not talking about flooding Triplett with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| So I would be in full favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| And Iíll second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7225)|
| 2:00:30| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| Yeah, I agree with Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Newton and Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7232)|
| 2:00:39| I think itís a good development. I think itíll be a great development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| My problem is there are quite a few unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| Is it private roads, public roads? Is there going to be a buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| And thatís why I would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| Just bring back a package that says this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| I think itís a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| I donít have a problem with the density or the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| I just want to know what Iím approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| You know, right now Iím guessing itís going to be a really good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| But in 30 days, if you could bring back something that says this is what itís going to be, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| Thatís my only caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Mr. Brisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| Yeah, a couple things that I didnít mention earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| That the Planning Commissionís able to reduce the peripheral setback on the eastern and southern boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| on the western and northern boundary of the subdivision because it adjoins commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| The Planning Commission cannot reduce the peripheral setback below 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| Itís my understanding that the applicant is looking at requesting a variance from the BZA to reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7300)|
| 2:01:48| Again, I think if thatís their intent, I think to give them a little more room to shift things around on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7308)|
| 2:01:56| and being consistent with the, something like a 25-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| Iíve decided since I got back Iím not going to go before the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| And the reason, well, we did not make conditions for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| is that we were recommending denial of the variance issue and postponing it to try to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| So we didnít want to make it easy to not follow staffís recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| So you want to make it hard on us is what youíre saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| Very clever, very clever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| So we do have a motion by Commissioner Smith, a second by Commissioner Browning to approve the three variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| We wanted to approve all three variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| Yeah, the variances that weíve discussed, the double lot, the lot depth to 115, Iím fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7360)|
| 2:02:48| And then the horizontal, two horizontal curve variances, thatís the only ones Iím aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| I just wanted to make sure, because, what your motion was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| So your motion is to approve all the variances requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7378)|
| 2:03:04| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| There is one light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Yeah, we donít see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Iím sorry, Mr. Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Donít we need the staff recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Donít we need the staff recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| The staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| Well, I mean, in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| Iím going to start with some conditions Iíd recommend and then turn to Mr. Breschko to complete those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| One would be submission of the road plans to Knox County Engineering for approval to ensure that the roads are built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| even though theyíre private, theyíre built to county standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| Details on the buffer and the fence and some agreement or information regarding the maintenance of that buffer and fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7423)|
| 2:03:55| I turn to Mr. Breschko on this with regard to the peripheral setbacks on the sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| on which this commission can grant a reduction in the peripheral setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| I would refer to Mr. Breschko on the further details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| I hope heís got those figured out while I give him a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| Are these conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Probably submit a set of HOA regime documents that would provide for all the maintenance of SID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7455)|
| 2:04:21| These are conditions on the second vote, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| They would be on the use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| He sends a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| After the variance, those would be concept conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| and then the peripheral setback issue would be a part of the use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Development plan or use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Iím pretty much in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Mr. Breschko had something else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| I was just going to state that in discussions we had with the county regarding the road design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| that they would have supported that design with some final fine-tuning at design plan stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| which means that we would support the two horizontal curve variances that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| We just didnít address those because of the double frontage, which would have shifted things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| I donít see any real opposition to this, but I agree with Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| We need time to get it lined out, get it right on what weíre really voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7521)|
| 2:05:28| Iíd be in favor of that and come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7528)|
| 2:05:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| Letís first vote on the motion that we have on the floor, and then if that fails, then we can have another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| So the motion right now by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7541)|
| 2:05:48| is to approve the subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7553)|
| 2:05:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Iím sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| Weíre going to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| I got distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| We have two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7568)|
| 2:06:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| We have two more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7574)|
| 2:06:21| Motion to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7589)|
| 2:06:32| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7594)|
| 2:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| I wanted to create a list of conditions in addition to what Gerald had stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| And some of these are kind of the standard conditions, but in one of our next cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| well, one that we approved, Severe Meadows, the typical conditions we would have as a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| is the connection to sanitary sewer, meaning the requirements of the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| provision of street names and compliance with the street naming and addressing system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| installation of the sidewalks as identified on the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| and they shall meet all applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| and Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| The meeting all applicable requirements of Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| which could get into the final details of the road design changes that weíve talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7639)|
| 2:07:28| Placing a note on the final plat that all ops will have access only to the internal street system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| and then submitting a planning staff prior to final review the certification design plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7653)|
| 2:07:42| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Madam Chair, Iíd like to include those conditions into my motion as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| based on the conditions as read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| I see no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7689)|
| 2:08:10| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7692)|
| 2:08:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| Madam Chair, a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| What would be the pavement width for the internal roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| Twenty-six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| Twenty-six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| It also has sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| Itís a totally walkable community with a clubhouse, pool, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| Would it be possible to reduce those and would the developer want those reduced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| Iíll be glad to let the engineers work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7722)|
| 2:08:48| The planning commission does have the ability to reduce pavement width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| and if the planning commission wishes to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| and Iíll try this and look to the expertise of Mr. Bretschko,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| but the planning commission, as one of the conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7743)|
| 2:09:07| approves a reduction of pavement width as approved by the Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| and as requested by the developer and approved by the Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| That was one of our conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| I mean, if everybodyís in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| I would suggest or recommend that we go down as low as 22 but not to exceed 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7761)|
| 2:09:29| And, again, if they are going as a private right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7769)|
| 2:09:34| they can actually have a 40-foot right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| and a 20-foot pavement width actually with the most recent changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| So we can work with them going to design plan on the design of that private street standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7782)|
| 2:09:48| that would still meet public street standards that could be approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| And that actually may give them a little more room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| As long as they can get the sidewalks within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| it will give them more room with the increased peripheral setback requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| Tom, would that be an amendment to the previous motion on the pavement width?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7805)|
| 2:10:12| We already voted. It would need to be a separate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7812)|
| 2:10:15| That would be a cost-saving thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7815)|
| 2:10:16| So I think he would be motivated to do that if heís allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| Can I make a motion that we add that to the previous approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| a second by Commissioner Clancy to approve an additional condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| Before we vote on that, we do have a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| Whatís the reasoning behind the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| Mr. Graf, Iím not comfortable with 26-foot wide roads in a development of this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| It just increases traffic speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| I think it creates more of a hazardous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| I think you increase the runoff, so your drainage detention facilities are going to be more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| more additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Heís putting in sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| I think a 22, 24-foot wide road is quite appropriate for this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7865)|
| 2:11:12| and youíve got access on two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| That may be your opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| My opinion is Iíd like to see it at 28 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7878)|
| 2:11:22| The older you get, the wider you want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| And Iím getting pretty old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7889)|
| 2:11:33| I feel great when I get on a wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| I think narrower makes them less safe, makes it less safe for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7897)|
| 2:11:44| So, anyway, I donít see that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7904)|
| 2:11:50| I think in reality the speed limit in here is going to be like 15 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| What theyíre getting at is people donít obey the speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7916)|
| 2:12:00| Thatís trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Mr. Briscoe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Weíre in there regarding the private street design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| One of the other things that had been raised here was this being gated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| That raises a whole other issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| and part of that would be reviewed by the Fire Prevention Bureauís office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| because the location of that gate sometimes requires a turnaround area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| And so the final design in approving a gated access would be subject to engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7948)|
| 2:12:35| Fire Prevention Bureauís approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7955)|
| 2:12:38| and may require a referral back here if they cannot work those details out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| Leo, private roads, whatís the smallest you guys would approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7971)|
| 2:12:52| 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| And you will not allow any gates on a public road, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| Thatís correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7976)|
| 2:12:57| They would have to be private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| Mr. Briscoe, your lightís still on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7981)|
| 2:13:03| I was going to make the motion on the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| Weíd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| When youíre ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7989)|
| 2:13:10| But we do currently have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Just call that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| Let me get to the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7998)|
| 2:13:19| So we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| a second by Commissioner Clancy to add one condition to the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| with regards to the road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| And all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| Motion to approve the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| And thatís where I would like to offer an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| But you didnít have your light on this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Well, I took it off because I didnít want to confuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| And I guess on approving the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| the wording would probably need to state for the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| of up to 26 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| and a reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| along the eastern and southern boundary lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| Motion so amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8062)|
| 2:14:27| No other lights on to approve the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| And it is 344.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| I know weíve got a lot of other items on the agenda that you folks have been waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| However, I am going to call a recess for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| I want to thank the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| So we will reconvene at 4 oíclock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8094)|
| 2:15:00| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Weíre going to continue on with agenda item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8101)|
| 2:15:05| Weíre moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| This is another subdivision report concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| Subdivision is Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| Applicant developer is Masada Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| Location is northwest side of Coward Mill Road, east side of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| Approximate acreage is 33.84 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| The zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8133)|
| 2:15:36| The existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| And the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| Number of lots is 115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Subdivisions, there is one subdivision variance required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8146)|
| 2:15:52| And the staff recommendation is to approve the concept plan for 115 detached residential units on individual lots subject to 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8152)|
| 2:16:01| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| I see three hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Do you folks have a spokesperson or do you want to split your time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| Sir, do you want the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| Your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Randy Wolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| I live at 12213 Warrior Trail, but I own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| I have a business adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| That was all zoned BPTO at one point when I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| I guess the point I want to make, there's lots of issues, for me anyway, but there's two water features in this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8201)|
| 2:16:49| It's not shown on these maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| Maybe you all know, but I was just talking to some of the guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| But there's a spring on the other side of Coward Mill Road that bubbles up out of the ground, comes across my property, which is 10615,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| and then transects this property, goes all the way down and goes under Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| Then on the backside of this planned development, there's a huge sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| It's every bit as big as this right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| I was down here before when this all came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| The guys are over there now pushing those trees over with great big trackos, and they're filling it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8238)|
| 2:17:24| But I got pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| I got them in my pocket if anybody wants to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| But that thing fills up with water and transects this property and runs down towards Pellissippi and goes under Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8247)|
| 2:17:35| I thought there was some sort of easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| I mean, maybe it's going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8258)|
| 2:17:42| but these drawings have houses and lots sitting all over top of both of these streams that transect this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8262)|
| 2:17:52| Thank you. Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8272)|
| 2:17:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| My name is Deborah Pettit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| I live at 10451 Laurel Point Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| I represent over 200 homeowners on Raglan Road and Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| We know that this property we've been here many times about this property in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8291)|
| 2:18:16| Our concerns are still with the traffic and the changes to our way of life, but we accept your previous decision regarding this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8296)|
| 2:18:23| But now we ask to accept your staff's recommendation to leave all the previous restrictions and guidelines that were in place for Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8303)|
| 2:18:31| I would like to save some of my time because I would like to see what they are proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| if there are going to be any changes to those guidelines or restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| And was there one more person in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8324)|
| 2:18:50| I just misunderstood the rules. I didn't mean I wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8330)|
| 2:18:57| Okay. The applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Drew Statton with Masonic Investments LLC, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8342)|
| 2:19:10| Regarding the stream issue as well as the guidelines and the restrictions, that's something I can't not speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| but I'd be more than happy to meet with you guys outside of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| And so that's all I have to say on those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| Yeah, we didn't quite catch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8364)|
| 2:19:28| I cannot not speak to the stream issue or the guideline restriction issue without Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| Speak to the microphone. That's why we couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| I'm sorry, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8375)|
| 2:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| I cannot speak to the stream issue that was concerning the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| or the guidelines and restrictions issue without Mr. Davis present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| And so I would be more than happy to meet with him outside of this, the opposition, at a time of their convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8385)|
| 2:19:52| Okay. Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| Ms. Pettit, you had some questions that you were hoping the applicant would address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8397)|
| 2:20:06| Well, we just want to make sure that the same restrictions that Mr. Biddle had on this property are going to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8406)|
| 2:20:14| That might be something Mr. Breschke or Mr. Green can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| The conditions as proposed by staff, the 12 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| would address the standards that were on the concept plan approved for Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8423)|
| 2:20:30| If the staff recommendation for approval with those 12 conditions is accepted by the commission and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8430)|
| 2:20:38| then those standards would transfer to the new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| I believe that's all of them. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| And the only additional thing is there's a reference in the revised staff report to a variance that may be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| but with the condition regarding the sidewalks being provided within the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| there is no variance needed on the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| And on the issue of the plan that's in the concept folder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8462)|
| 2:21:07| which has been looked at by engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| identifies a wetland and stream area on the property and required buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8470)|
| 2:21:15| so they've identified that in the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| and that would be addressed in detail at the design plan stage with county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| Commissioner Newton, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| I was going to mention the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| Okay. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan for 115 detached residential units on individual lots subject to the 12 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8494)|
| 2:21:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| We had a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| a second by Commissioner Browning, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8507)|
| 2:21:50| Okay. We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8510)|
| 2:21:52| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8512)|
| 2:21:53| I have a question for staff or for engineering about the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8513)|
| 2:21:58| Do we think that those are burrow pits or sinkholes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| On the KGIS topo map, the only two closed depressions are adjacent to Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| and those are both locations where there are culverts that go under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8527)|
| 2:22:12| The gentleman who was speaking said there's another one, but they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8532)|
| 2:22:21| Whether there was too much foliage covering them, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8541)|
| 2:22:33| That that you see there, there's a culvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8553)|
| 2:22:38| Pellissippi Parkway went across a ravine, but there is a culvert, so it doesn't actually hold water at that point where you're looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8558)|
| 2:22:46| How about the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8566)|
| 2:22:58| Same thing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| Yeah, that's also where the culvert is, and the wetland is up above that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8580)|
| 2:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| I've got a picture if you want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| I've got an SD card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| Does anybody need to see a photo of the sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| What's a picture of that big sinkhole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| I was concerned that there's—of course, this is all preliminary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| but it looks like these lots and houses are sitting right on top of all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| and they do—they transect that property, and both of them go under Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8615)|
| 2:23:46| If I understood what staff said, they're saying that those are culverts rather than sinkholes, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8626)|
| 2:23:51| Well, the culverts are under where the water goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| After it comes out of the sinkhole and runs through the property, it goes under Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| When they built the parkway, they made room for those streams to run through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8639)|
| 2:24:04| One is a spring-fed stream, and the other—the water just funnels into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8644)|
| 2:24:13| There's actually two sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| There's another sinkhole that's not on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| It's close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| It's on the Zimmerman's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| This property, it's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| It's as big as this room right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| It fills up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| It holds water for about two or three weeks, and it slowly sinks down, and the creek runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8665)|
| 2:24:30| I mean, they built a culvert for it when they built Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| It's there, and this has housing sitting all over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| And, you know, the whole Hardin Valley is getting—you can't move over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8679)|
| 2:24:47| and I think that's one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| This is—I don't know how many cars might come out of this place, but you can't—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| where are they going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| How are they going to get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| There's 250 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8701)|
| 2:25:02| Just a follow-up question for staff, if I can, is that if it is—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8702)|
| 2:25:06| will there be further investigation by staff or engineering to look at the wetland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| and the buffers and the stream in the spring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| Yeah, we've already actually gotten a design plan for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| for the original concept plan that was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| They did not—I'll point it out to the engineers that there's a claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| that there's a sinkhole on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| They did identify the wetlands that are above one of the closed depressions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8731)|
| 2:25:37| adjacent to Pellissippi Parkway, but there are culverts under those ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| If there's another one, if I can find the location, I'll point it out to the engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| This concept plan was done by a surveyor rather than an engineer, which is allowable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| but the design plan has to be done by the engineering firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| Mr. Breschke, did you have something you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8759)|
| 2:26:02| I was just going to mention that on the issue about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8762)|
| 2:26:06| there's conditions on this that applied to when Rusty Biddle had it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8766)|
| 2:26:11| that they're limited to the number of permits they can get on this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8771)|
| 2:26:14| until the Cherahala Extension Project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| Well, the time on the permitting is 180 days out from the completion of that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8778)|
| 2:26:25| but the project would take Cherahala Boulevard, extend it from Hardin Valley up to Coward Mill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| so that changes traffic flow and actually allows traffic to go out at Hardin Valley at Coward Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8791)|
| 2:26:39| We have again looked recently, working with TDOT, at the possibility in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8799)|
| 2:26:45| of creating a bridge crossover at Coward Mill over to Solway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| In the projects we looked at rezoning on Solway Road area, we'd identified that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| and the applicant in that case said their engineer would work with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| on trying to preserve that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| So there's going to be a change in the future on access and traffic circulation through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8825)|
| 2:27:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8833)|
| 2:27:16| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8839)|
| 2:27:25| I see no further lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| The motion is to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| First, staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8856)|
| 2:27:37| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8859)|
| 2:27:42| We are on to agenda item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8862)|
| 2:28:08| We're on agenda item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| The applicant is Ralph Smith, PLS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| The location is the east side of Old Clinton Pike, north of West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| Approximate size of the tract is four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| Present zoning is A, agricultural, and RB, general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| Zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry, and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| Proposed use is individual lots with duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| Density proposed is 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8920)|
| 2:28:44| Staff recommendation is to recommend that county commission approve planned residential zoning up to 4.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8924)|
| 2:28:54| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| Yes, Ralph Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8937)|
| 2:29:00| Mr. Smith, you've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| I needed to ask for a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| I'm sorry, your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| 205 Lamar Avenue, Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| I needed to ask for an increase in the dwelling units in the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8950)|
| 2:29:13| I had originally asked for 4.5 dwelling units per acre when we did our preliminary design for it back in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8953)|
| 2:29:23| and we were banking on four acres back then just on paper, and we did our survey, and we came up with 3.85 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8963)|
| 2:29:30| And so we need to amend that request on the density to 4.8 dwelling units per acre instead of 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8970)|
| 2:29:44| Okay, to 4.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8984)|
| 2:29:52| Ms. Portier, you are the staff on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| Do you have any comments on that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| No, we don't have any issue with that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| It's well within what's allowed, and it's up to a shopping center to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=8999)|
| 2:30:05| There's a mobile home park across the street, and behind it is a post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| It's not going to adversely affect the area in any way to increase it by such a small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| I have the same question that I had at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9019)|
| 2:30:26| If you look on 26-2, it says the proposed amendment shall be consistent with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9026)|
| 2:30:38| and purpose of the applicable zoning ordinance, and it must comply with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9038)|
| 2:30:45| The proposed amendment to PR zoning is intended to provide optional methods of land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9045)|
| 2:30:53| which encourage more imaginative solutions to environmental design problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9053)|
| 2:31:01| Thus, it would be characterized by a unified building and site development program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9061)|
| 2:31:10| open space for recreation, and provision for commercial, religious, educational, and cultural facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9070)|
| 2:31:19| which are integrated with the total project by unified architectural and open space treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9079)|
| 2:31:27| And looking at what we had submitted, I don't see any of that on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9087)|
| 2:31:47| Do you have a question of the developer or staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| Or is it just a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| I guess of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9116)|
| 2:31:57| Because I don't see any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| Well, this request is just for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| It's not for the actual development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9121)|
| 2:32:02| So any of those issues would be resolved or worked through during the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| He's showing you what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| And as Ms. Portier said, at this point we're not approving the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| I believe Mr. Smith, on behalf of his client, just provided this as background information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9135)|
| 2:32:21| The plan will have to come back to this board for approval as part of the PR zoning standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9141)|
| 2:32:30| Staff has heard your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| I think the designer has also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9152)|
| 2:32:35| So I would encourage Mr. Smith to get with his client and pay attention to those principles of the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9155)|
| 2:32:45| and bring back a plan that may be more imaginative and creative than the sample plan that was provided as part of the rezoning package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9165)|
| 2:32:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9175)|
| 2:32:56| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| I'd like to make a motion that we recommend that the County Commission approve PR plan residential zoning up to 4.8 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9177)|
| 2:33:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Browning to approve the planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9186)|
| 2:33:12| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| We are on to agenda item number 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9203)|
| 2:33:35| This is also rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| The applicant is a development corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9218)|
| 2:33:42| Location is the Southside Manila Drive, southwest of South Carter School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9222)|
| 2:33:49| Project information is 5.808 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9229)|
| 2:33:54| Present plan designation zoning is BP1 Business Park slash EC Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9234)|
| 2:34:01| Proposed plan designation zoning is LD low density residential slash A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9241)|
| 2:34:09| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| Proposed use is residential or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| Proposed is .17 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| And this is going to take two votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| One vote per staff recommendation would be adopt resolution 6A19SP amending the East County sector plan to low density residential designation and recommend that County Commission also adopt the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9263)|
| 2:34:41| And the second vote is with regards to staff recommendation that County Commission approve A agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9281)|
| 2:34:53| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9296)|
| 2:35:04| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| Yes, Ray Christian, 17 Market Square, 37902 with the Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| We just ask that you approve based on staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9317)|
| 2:35:18| Yeah, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| I'm going to make a motion we adopt resolution 6A19SP amending the East County sector plan to LDR low density residential designation and recommend that County Commission adopt the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9320)|
| 2:35:34| And I would say that this was just an error in the original sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9334)|

| 2:36:10| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to recommend County Commission approve zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9370)|

| 2:36:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9385)|
| 2:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9386)|
| 2:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| And we are moving on to agenda item number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9396)|
| 2:36:42| The applicant is Robbie Toole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| The location is the west side of East Governor John Sevier Highway, northwest of French Road and southwest of Old French Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9405)|
| 2:36:54| Tract information is nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| The present plan designation zoning is LDR low density residential slash A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9417)|
| 2:37:05| Proposed plan designation zoning is RC rural commercial slash CR rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9425)|
| 2:37:13| The existing land use is agricultural forestry vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| The proposed use is rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| We have two votes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9444)|
| 2:37:27| One per the staff recommendation to deny the RC rural commercial sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| And also a second vote would be to deny, per staff recommendation, deny the CR rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9453)|
| 2:37:41| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| We also have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9468)|
| 2:37:49| Sir, do you want to go first or let the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I will respond to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9475)|
| 2:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9481)|
| 2:38:02| My name is Janice Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| Ma'am, could you pull the microphone down a little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| My name is Janice Pritchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| I live at 1918 Serene Cove Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9488)|
| 2:38:15| I submitted a comment through your commission website as did additional person, Kent Lusby, and one other person, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9495)|
| 2:38:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| I would just like to indicate that I'm requesting the planning commission to deny the sector plan amendment 6B19SP and rezoning request 6119RZ as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9511)|
| 2:38:49| The applicants who are investigating these applications to change the sector designation and rezoning application have articulated in writing compelling reasons to not approve the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9529)|
| 2:39:05| If the applicant succeeded in changing the designations from the R8 to RC and to RC for the LDR at the nine-acre location at the John Smear site, the address 0 East John Smear Highway, it would negatively impact the already limited residential section of this highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9545)|
| 2:39:32| There is only approximately two and a half miles of residential area in this section of John Smear Highway which needs to be maintained as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9572)|
| 2:39:49| The proposed commercial business would be right at a curve in the road which would adversely affect the flow of traffic as there is no traffic light in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9589)|
| 2:40:01| John Smear Highway on the other side of the river is high-density commercial with approximately 35 commercial businesses and it appears the commission is going to approve the use of one of those vacant commercial properties at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9601)|
| 2:40:26| The location of the proposed rezoning and change of the sector plan is adjacent to KUB on the opposite sides of the Crossroads Church as well as just across from the East Tennessee Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9626)|
| 2:40:46| Increased commercial development will only impede traffic flow, impact residential low-density, and negatively impact the reverence of the area for the cemetery honoring our military men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9646)|
| 2:41:02| Additionally, this property, if it goes commercial, would be another property that will add to the already commercial sites on the riverfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9662)|
| 2:41:17| As we know, when things go commercial, the history is they rarely ever change back to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9677)|
| 2:41:27| So, again, I am hopeful that the commission would deny these rezoning and sector plan amendments. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9687)|
| 2:41:38| Thank you. Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9698)|
| 2:41:43| My name is John Valiant. I'm an attorney. My address is Suite 1650, 800 South Gate Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9703)|
| 2:41:55| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Toole, who is also here and could answer any questions you may have of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9715)|
| 2:42:03| I've read the staff recommendation. I understand what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9723)|
| 2:42:09| One of the things that I want to clarify is that when we went to NPC, we were asking what can we do, what would be the closest zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9729)|
| 2:42:18| We'll take any zoning that would allow what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| We'll also cut back the acreage to four acres if the nine acres is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| We just arbitrarily drew a line cutting this track down smaller to accommodate the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9747)|
| 2:42:35| On the map that you've got handed out to you, it shows some of the reasons why low-density residential wouldn't really work on this particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9755)|
| 2:42:51| One, if you look across the river, you see an active quarry operation, which is American Limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9771)|
| 2:43:00| There's active dynamiting going on there on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| People who live in residential communities don't want dynamite going off on a regular basis right across from where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9786)|
| 2:43:15| So that causes one problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| Secondly, there is a flood zone that takes up the lower portion of the property, and it's oddly shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9798)|
| 2:43:29| It takes part of the bottom next to the river, and then it sort of forms a reverse question mark going up into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9809)|
| 2:43:37| So it would, my guess, it would take maybe a third or half of the property, make it undevelopable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9817)|
| 2:43:47| What we could use it is is we're going to grow straw there for the purpose of his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9827)|
| 2:43:53| Now, what his business is, as I've discussed with some of the staff, is remediation of erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9833)|
| 2:44:04| He does a lot of work for DOE, DOT, and their contractors, some utility districts in Knox County, Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9844)|
| 2:44:13| and I think he does some work maybe for KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9853)|
| 2:44:29| Another problem we have is that across the John Sevier Highway is the Veterans Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9869)|
| 2:44:37| I think that would also cause some problems with regard to people who may want to locate a residential community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9877)|
| 2:44:49| The map shows you how sparsely the residences are in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| This is not going to be a noxious business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9895)|
| 2:44:58| Most of the traffic that's going to be going in and out of this are going to be the trucks that are going out of this business to go to DOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9898)|
| 2:45:07| go to DOT jobs, and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| So it's not going to be a high or intensely high traffic area because of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9913)|
| 2:45:23| He's having to locate from another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| He's got a vibrant business, but it's not something that I would consider noxious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9926)|
| 2:45:32| He's actually trying to ameliorate problems that the county has, the state has, utility districts have with regard to erosion and erosion control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9932)|
| 2:45:49| Oh, and we will be more than happy to accommodate any conditions that this commission or its staff would want to impose upon his use of this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9949)|
| 2:46:04| to ameliorate any effect it would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9964)|
| 2:46:10| So we will take any questions that anybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9970)|
| 2:46:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9976)|
| 2:46:23| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9983)|
| 2:46:25| Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| I've looked over at this and read the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| I think the staff's got it correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| And I'm going to make a motion we deny R.C. Rural Center sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Buston to deny her staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| Do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10005)|
