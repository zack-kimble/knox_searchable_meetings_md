| 0:02:24| kind of anchor into my prayers, my any efforts, my thought life, the way that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=144)|

| 0:14:23| And I couldn't be more proud of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=863)|

| 0:19:53| The county itself only has to deal with one organization and manage one instead of 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| We don't take any administration fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1200)|

| 0:20:25| Can you guys stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1225)|

| 0:21:23| It's a contract for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| So the county hires these 24 organizations to operate as a magnet to bring people from outside Knox County into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1287)|
| 0:21:39| To draw them here to spend a bunch of money that the county gets to keep after they go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1299)|
| 0:21:47| So how well did the consortium do their job during calendar year 2022?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| Just on the heels of the pandemic, I'm here to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1313)|

| 0:22:11| who brought with them $33,866,000, which those visitors kindly left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1331)|
| 0:22:22| At restaurants like the Tomato Head and Copper Cellar, hotels such as the Holiday Inn and Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| parking lots like Dwight Kessel, and shops like Bliss and even the Farragut Con.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| The sales tax alone that Knox County collected from those visitors was $3,134,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1357)|
| 0:22:50| If you only count the sales tax, Knox County appreciated a $7.50 return on every $1 of investment in these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1370)|
| 0:23:04| In another happy consequence of the 4,000 events and activities the consortium produces to attract visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| is that Knox County families and children also benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1391)|
| 0:23:16| Perhaps in the past week you have received a letter or two from the thousands of Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| who enjoy and appreciate their favorite consortium members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Did you get any letters? Emails? Genes chuckling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| What this means is that a local museum installation that attracts and inspires visitors from out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1413)|
| 0:23:42| will also instruct and delight local school children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| Likewise, a symphony performance enjoyed by public school children during the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| will be performed for tourists at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I can't think of a cleverer way for our county to use hotel-motel tax funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1437)|
| 0:24:05| to generate so much benefit for so many in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Now I'd like to turn the floor over to my friend, Deborah Porter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1451)|

| 0:29:11| and all the things that go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1751)|

| 0:29:24| Would you send that report to us in the final year report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Don't send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| Send it to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1769)|

| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| You mean the ARPA report or this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Well, the total of the 637.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Oh, I'm happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Who that breaks down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| And then any year-end report that you would have would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| It would help us out a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| I'll do it, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1783)|

| 0:30:03| Presentation of rural metro monthly report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Madam Chair, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| It's a different microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| Jeff Bagwell, 160 North Campbell Station Road in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| Monthly report for rural metro January of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| 794 medical first responder calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| 97 car crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| 10 residential structure fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| 77 fire alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| 19 hazardous conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| 361 lift assist or invalid assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| 28 still assignments or car fires, brush fires, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| We responded to properties valued at just over $645,950 and had a property loss of $221,547, which means we saved an average of 76% of the valued property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1838)|
| 0:31:08| With an average response time of six minutes and with 8%, only 8% of the reported fires being contained to the room of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1868)|
| 0:31:16| In January, we had a tremendous number of house fires that when called in to us, the structures were already well involved with fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| That puts the fire department, I don't care which fire department you're talking about, behind the eight ball and makes it very, very difficult for us to save a lot of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1885)|
| 0:31:34| We transitioned to new software in January 1st of this year, so getting data is now a learning experience for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1894)|
| 0:31:44| This software has data gathering points that seem to be endless, however, there is a learning curve that I have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| Station 30 in Halls continues to be the busiest in Knox County with 198 emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| Station 36 in Powell is now in second with 177.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| The North Battalion continues to be the busiest at 477 and the busiest hours this month were between 12 and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| At the first of this month, we celebrated a birthday, our birthday, of 75 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| Now, while we've only been in Knox County since 1977, Lou Weitzman created our company in February of 1948 in a small rural community outside Scottsdale, Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1939)|
| 0:32:31| Lou was a young newspaper reporter, we don't see those much anymore, and experienced what few of us will ever experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1951)|
| 0:32:38| and that's watching a neighbor's house burn to the ground with no fire department response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| He purchased a fire truck, petitioned some other men to join him in protecting the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| and asked his fellow community citizens to help pay for the endeavor by paying a yearly membership fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| Little did Lou know that he had just created an alternative funding source for rural communities that lacked municipal fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1977)|
| 0:33:06| Rural Metro Fire Department entered into an operating agreement with Chief Blankenship at West Knoxville Fire Department in 1977| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| at the request of Knox County leadership and then county leader Dwight Kessel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| We later did the same with East Knox County, Hall's Powell, bringing organized stable fire protection to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| Mr. Kessel knew that Knox County would not grow without this valuable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| Not only was he right, but we've seen a tremendous amount of growth since 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| You can read more about that in the albums that I gave you guys at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| There's a whole, like, ten pages of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a quick question, Mr. Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Do you all provide any mutual aid to any of our neighboring counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Yes. Anderson County, that's where the six came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| We went to Anderson County twice, Union County once, and Granger County three times, if I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| What type of services do you provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Just fire protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Most of those, we're always sending water haulers for house fires, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you. Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Mr. Bagwell, we just finished a beer board meeting where we talked about a particular establishment in the Halls area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2063)|
| 0:34:32| which you talked about being the highest call volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| You can find that. It's the El Tequila Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| You can find the address on our beer board agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| Between now and next month, would you look back through your data and see if you can determine how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| and what types of calls you've gotten from that address or that immediate proximity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Do you remember the address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Well, I'll get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Maybe for the last 120 days, you would be the responding agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| Separate from our Sheriff's Office, if you could help us better understand what impact it has made on your force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| 7,002 Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2122)|

| 0:35:38| Under our rules, those who have signed up to speak to a particular agenda item will speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| We have one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2144)|

| 0:35:53| Hi. Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| I'm going to start off with a few comments just about this commission real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| I know you don't get this often, but I'd like to compliment this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| What I saw at last week's work session was phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| The attention to detail, the homework you put in, especially during the zoning meeting, was phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| The trajectory this commission's on from last year, two years ago, is just really encouraging, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| Second, junior commissioners, I don't know what I expected out of this program, but it wasn't what I saw last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| You guys aren't just here to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| You guys are putting together a perspective and a voice that's badly needed on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| and I really appreciate everything you did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| If you have imposter syndrome, don't, because you guys absolutely crushed it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| To that point, what you talked about mostly was the proposed age requirement for corrections officers going from 19 to 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2204)|
| 0:36:57| In theory, I support that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| I enlisted in the Army at the age of 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Some of the most high-performing soldiers I served next to were on the younger side, enlisting at 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| That argument was made by the Sheriff's Department and by members of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| If they can serve our country, why can't they serve our county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| I did the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| When I joined the Army, I was given 4,690 hours of training before I was put in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| The Sheriff's Department is proposing that 18-year-olds receive 366 hours of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| That's only 7% of the training I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| It's less than 25% of the training that KPD officers receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2258)|
| 0:37:45| More to the points you were making, does KCSO set up a safe environment where 18-year-olds' mental and physical health is protected while they're serving in the prison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:58| Based on statements that KCSO made to the Merit Systems Board or Merit Systems Board of Directors, I would think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2278)|
| 0:38:09| To quote Board Member Wright, just for clarification, if they, the 18-year-olds, are working in there, would they be in a pod by themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2289)|
| 0:38:18| Sheriff Spangler, quote, of course they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Yes, sir, they will have that six-week training just like everybody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| And we've had some of our younger people do just as well as our matured people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Quote, Deputy Chief Purvis, right now we are at a great deficit inside corrections facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| We are continually challenged in trying to perform the mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| We want to make the environment as safe as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| And in order to do that, we need additional bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| That implies that it's not a safe environment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| And based on throwing a handful of 18-year-olds at the problem, when there's 100 correctional officers shortage, it's not going to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2326)|
| 0:38:55| So you're shoving 18-year-olds into an unsafe prison situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| The underlying problem here is not that the Sheriff's Department can't hire 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| The underlying problem here is that the Sheriff's Department is at a tipping point in a staffing shortage where they're about to run afoul of state and federal regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2345)|
| 0:39:15| And 18-year-olds are not going to solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| I've begged you to look at this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| I know it is not something that you can initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| But the Sheriff's Department, the mayor, and this commission need to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| And you need to raise salaries for KCSO employees by approximately 25% to stay competitive in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| That is a big ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| That's a big lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| But I've identified $6 million, at least, that you could dedicate to that in the Sheriff's Department budget with no impact to how the community is served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| This rule change is simply flailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| It's grasping at last-ditch efforts to not raise salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| And I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I'd like you to ask some questions about why salaries are flailing at KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| Because it makes no sense given what we've seen over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you for your time and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2410)|

| 0:43:55| Mr. Snowden, you're on the hot seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| The developers are developing the property as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Do you know how many has been developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| I went out there, but I didn't drive down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| It's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| There was a total of three developments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| The first development, the one that's closest to the intersection as you're driving on Fritz or Hatmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| away from the town limits, is Windsor Forest, and it has 126 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| The next one, as you approach, is Towering Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| It has 84 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| And then the one at the very terminus of Hatmaker, Fritz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| where Fritz got bisected by the interstate, Fritz and Hatmaker actually just changed names as you drive on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| The last one is 155 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| I think the math on that's somewhere just shy of 400 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| I asked you in the workshop, and I still don't understand why we're giving them a certificate of occupancy without them having the road done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2699)|
| 0:45:12| Until the road's done, they shouldn't be building houses, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| So I'm going to be voting no on this because I think it's wrong that the developers are getting out of paying at least half of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2716)|
| 0:45:28| And even maybe the town of Farragut should kick in some money because it's inside the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| And I know we're going to solve the problem in the future, but that doesn't stop us having to pay $500,000 to $600,000 of taxpayers' money to fix a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2734)|
| 0:45:45| that should have been at least cost-sharing with Moncks County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Do we really need a turn lane there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Is it a state requirement that we have to have a turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| Yeah, the metrics or the warranting procedures that we use are nationally recognized standards that are actually codified in our access control policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:12| So if this turn lane were on Moncks County Road, it would warrant that same condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| The premise behind it is if you have so many following vehicles and stopped vehicles, there's the higher potential of rear-end crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| So I would feel as if this turn lane isn't constructed, it would negatively impact the operation of Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| I appreciate you, and I understand that. I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| But I'm just so aggravated knowing what took place by these two developers, Mr. Scott Davis and Mr. Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| It just irritates me, and it will probably irritate me until I won't get to sleep tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| So thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Mr. Snowden, just for the record, the three subdivisions that you just listed, that's a total of 365 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2820)|
| 0:47:09| Those properties, because there's been some confusion, are actually located in Moncks County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| Those subdivisions are not within the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| The only thing that's in the Town of Farragut is actually Campbell Station Road, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| That is correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| And then kind of following Commissioner Daley's comment, for somebody doing 365 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2845)|
| 0:47:35| again, they're not required to do any road improvements because of what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| the amount of volume of traffic on that little two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| That is correct, but it's a condition that, unfortunately, we don't have the legal authority to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| But we're going to fix that, hopefully, coming to this body next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2875)|
| 0:48:03| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| I just wanted to clarify, I think Commissioner Schoonmaker said this, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Moncks County allowed the four rezonings of these properties, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| Yes, all three of these properties were rezoned in the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve by Commissioner Beeler, with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=2917)|

| 0:53:59| The age requirement was lowered from 21 to 19 in September 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| I asked how many applicants age 21 and over since September 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| There have been 166 applications age 19 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Ninety-eight of the 166 took the Psyche Vow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| Eight of those 98 failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Since lowering the minimum age, how many 19 and 20-year-old applicants have been received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| Did we see an increase in the applications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| And if so or if not, what were contributing factors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Since September 2021, there have been 26 total applicants that were 19 or 20 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| That's not a large increase since reducing the minimum age requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| How many of those applicants passed the background and Psyche Vow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| Nineteen have taken the Psychological as of the present date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3285)|

| 0:54:51| The other seven have failed the Psyche exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Those exams cost approximately $245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| How many of those 19 and 20-year-olds are still employed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3297)|

| 0:55:09| Dr. Adwin, who was with Helen Ross McNabb and actually conducts the Psyche Vows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| he got back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| I asked for the number of evaluations performed in the years 21, 22, and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| In 21, he did 183 evals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| In 22, 346.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| In 2023, he did 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| And how many of those evals were for applicants 19 and 20 years of age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| He does not have access to those numbers, nor does he have access to how many failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| And I asked him in his professional medical opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| what is the age appropriateness of applicants for this type of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| He said the relative immaturity of teenagers and lack of experience working in structured environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| especially safety-sensitive ones, is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| However, he's unaware of whether some teenagers can benefit from training to be competent corrections officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| I asked about his terms of employment with KCO and Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| He has an annual contract with them to perform NMPIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| This is for a specific service for Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| He came on at McNabb in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| He has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, and he's been licensed in Tennessee since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Most of his career, he has conducted pre-employment and fitness-duty psychological evals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| for law enforcement, security, health care professionals, and private industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| as well as court-related evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| So he is very experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I asked him what type of evaluations are used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| He said that they use a standard psychological evaluation that utilizes, at minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| an hour of a semi-structured interview and a standard psychological test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3404)|
| 0:56:50| the Minnesota Multi-FACIC Personality Inventory Type 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| collateral contacts with the sheriff's staff or past treatment providers are sought when indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3415)|

| 0:57:16| I asked just about the cost of the background checks and psyche evals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| A psychological is only given to candidates that are chosen to move through the hiring process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| but background checks are done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| I asked what is the cost to train new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| They said approximately about $6,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| This does not include all testing, background investigations, HR costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| uniforms, and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| This number does not include the cost of vacancy rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| How did recruiting efforts change after the age was lowered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| The sheriff's office began attending job fairs within local high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| I asked if there was a recruiting plan in place ready to go to engage 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| They said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| There wasn't any description of what that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Will training efforts and performance metrics be reviewed to accommodate lowering the age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| They said that it is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Who performs the psyche evals and how can they provide a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| They told me to contact Dr. Adler, which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| Have there been any officer-related incidents in corrections over the past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| The answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| There was no further clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| I asked how many unfulfilled positions there are presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| They currently have 93 vacant correction positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| I asked about cadet programs or explorer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| They have had an explorer program in the past that provided training and exposure to law enforcement at younger ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| They currently have 18-year-old employees working in the commissary and as property officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| That is the intake and release center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| They gave me a great description of their hiring process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Those are just some things that I reached out and asked for in the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3538)|
| 0:59:04| I just wanted to share those responses with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Chief Purvis, do you join us at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| I just wanted to give you an opportunity to not necessarily address every point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| but just reiterate that you run the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| You run in corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| Can you give a recap of why this is important for you as the department head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| We are continually trying to recruit individuals to come work in the corrections division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| As has already been pointed out, we are at 93 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| Within the scope of what we can do, we have exhausted everything that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| to try to get individuals in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| We are continually recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| One group that we haven't been able to reach out to are the ones that are just leaving high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| the 18-year-olds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| As has already been spoken by the gentleman that spoke earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| would we be reaching out to 18-year-olds if we weren't in a crisis in corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Because there is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| We have 93 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| We have had a mean average of around 73 vacancies throughout this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| The sheriff has done everything he can to include bonuses and longevity raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| Within the scope of his budget, he has done everything that is possible to try to reach out to folks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| This is an effort to try to recruit more individuals that are just entering into the job market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| I know that it has been spoken, there is a lot of concern about the training hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| I want to say that the Tennessee Corrections Institute requires basically seven days of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3649)|
| 1:01:00| and two of those days are online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| We have six weeks of training in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| and then we have an additional on-the-job training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| If at any point in time, if someone does have issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| and it is identified by the individual or by the supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| we will continue to train that individual until they are comfortable entering into that job skill, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3680)|
| 1:01:28| There is not six weeks, and if you make it, you make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| If you don't, then you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| If we get to the end of the six-week process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| and the trainers see that they are inadequately trained in a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| their job skill, whatever it may be, is not up to the standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| we can continue that training process up until that point that the individual is able to comfortably do the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| Same thing with the on-the-job training process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| If they are out there and they are not comfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| or the CTO is not comfortable with the individual's performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| we are not going to release that person into the job until everybody involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| including the individual that is doing the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| the person that is evaluating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| and the supervisor are all going to have to be on board before that person is released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| I know that there are larger agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Commissioner Oster talked about the big three out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| and I would like to say that those agencies all pay a significant amount more than we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| some of them as much as $53,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| We are just trying to reach out in any way that we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| to get adequate personnel in to perform the job that we are asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you for that recap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| I am going to be supporting this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I think we should give our Sheriff's Office every tool possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| Tell me an area of this community that doesn't have staffing shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| Find me one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| It is a really tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| It is a really tough market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| We have an opportunity to engage people into law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| and not lose them to partner agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I think that we have to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| and I do believe that if you can serve our country, you can serve our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| I hope that you will as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| I am going to be supporting this for maybe a little bit different reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| and that is that if you don't try something, you will never know if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| I am willing to give them the opportunity to try this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| but if a year from now or a year and a half from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| this is not the way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| I will be the first one to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| hey, we need to move it back to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| I don't really have strong feelings one way or the other on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| I do have a couple of comments, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| No one makes an 18-year-old apply and makes them do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| Sometimes we compare it to the draft or to the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Some of you may remember the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| These 18-year-olds did not have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| They were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| This is not a case where anyone is telling these high school graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| that they have to go and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| I am a little bit encouraged, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| by the numbers of those who did not pass the screenings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| because to me that indicates that that process is working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| that in fact they are taking into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| that many would not be psychologically or physically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| emotionally ready for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| and that's what that process is supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Is it ideal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| No, it certainly isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| But I'm not real sure it's necessarily our place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| to limit our high school graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| those that may want to go into law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| tell them that they cannot go that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| because they have not turned 19 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So that's kind of my thinking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| I do also have a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| I do understand the argument that if they are old enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| to make the decision to go to the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| as Commissioner Hill just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| the point that she just made at 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| that that is a good reason for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| to at least have this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| to be employed by the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| That is also the reasoning for us to have the 26th Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| to lower the voting age to 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| was because if they were old enough to fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| then they were old enough to vote for their commander in chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| I also understand and respect the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| that Commissioner Beeler referenced last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| We did appoint this merit board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| However, the vote for this to pass on merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| was four to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| It was not unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| So that gives me pause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| because almost half of them had pause as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| Do I think an 18-year-old is mature enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| after teaching them for seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| to be in charge of inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Is that my decision for those individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| So I'm really struggling with this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| and I don't know where I will land on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| I appreciate everyone's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| I'm very indifferent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| So becoming a law enforcement officer is a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| And how can I judge that at 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Because some people grow up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| that's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| I think my comment is just making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| that if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| that we make sure we create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| an environment of empowerment for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Because I still get calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| people feeling like they are not valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| So I just want to say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| from a leader to another leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Just really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| and really talking to the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| and making sure they are feeling valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| Chief Purvis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| How many years of law experience do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| I've got 30 years with the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Prior to that, I was a military policeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| I started with the United States Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| when I graduated from high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| So you're close to 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| Getting around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Sheriff is 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| That's 80 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| I'll trust 80 years of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| I have zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| except for the Citizens Academy back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| If we had 93 more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| if we filled the 93 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| have you ever started a shadow program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| to where they go through their six weeks training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| then they're with an experienced officer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| for six months to a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Right now, I'm sure you can't do that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| but if we had 93 vacancies filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| I think we could do a shadow program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| We have a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Every employee that begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| with a Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| and under merit system rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| is under a one-year probationary period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| And during that one-year probationary period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| they're going to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| They have a six-month, a nine-month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| and an annual evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| And during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| their supervisor is going to monitor their activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| and make sure that that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| is going to be able to be successful in this career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| And that entails not only that that individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| can do the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| but that the individual is going to do the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| without a detrimental effect to their person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| As Commissioner Lundy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| it is a calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| A lot of people are attracted to this line of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| that maybe don't belong in this line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| And that part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| is the supervisor evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| and ensuring that they are in the correct line of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| that they can meet the expectations of the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| but also that they're going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| to meet those expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| without it causing undue effect on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| For our junior commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| KPD is the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| They are under a mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| The KCSO is the Knoxville Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| under Sheriff Bangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| You're not a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Well, you're a department under the sheriff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| but the KCSO is the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| It's not a department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| So when you hear someone say sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| you've got to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| no, it's the sheriff's office is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| And the KPD is a department under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| The mayor of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| appoints the chief of police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and he answers to the chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| He or she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| Can I go to people who haven't spoken yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| I just had a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| What is KPD's hiring age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I think they are 21, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| I'm not 100% sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| They're older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| They also have a cadet program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Yes, ma'am, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| So I may be the lone commissioner on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| and I'm really okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| If I'm hearing that we're 93 officers short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4289)|
| 1:11:36| and we possibly wouldn't be looking at 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| if we had 93 officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| that gives me a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| I can't wrap my mind around anybody thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| putting an 18-year-old in a pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| with career criminals makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| To me, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| Everybody wants to talk about the military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| and there again, I've stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| I have very deep roots to the military and my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| and I actually spoke to a general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| that is my great-uncle last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| And anybody who's been in the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| understands that the hierarchy and the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| and the oversight that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| And if we're 93 officers short in a pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| I don't think that our kids are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| the staff that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| that they're going to be getting in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| Now, maybe I'm just simplifying it too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| and I'm the one with the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| I don't necessarily think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| I do want to ask you, Chief Furbus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| because I don't see Sheriff Spangler in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| I didn't see you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Let me ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| and I might not normally ask this to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| if we weren't talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| but have you guys reached out to officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| seasoned officers in other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| that are having problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| meaning that their cities and their states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| don't treat them well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| and they're getting out of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| because of the environment that they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| to possibly bring them to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| Sure, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| We've done all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| And there again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| I understand your concern as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| but here's my intention as a sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| who runs the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| is I've got to find any and every way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| that I can safely make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| that we have the employees that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| Not every 18-year-old, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| is going to pass the psychological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| or even make it through the vetting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| before the psychological even comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| We just want to be able to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| from another pool if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| because this is one good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| If an 18-year-old who is a shining star| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| in everything that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| and we don't hire them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| Blount County, Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Anderson County will hire them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| And I don't want to lose people like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| and I want to give them an opportunity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Again, I understand your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I know the gentleman that came up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| and spoke from public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| and I heard what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| I stand in front of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| We had to turn our budget in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| I've got a request in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| And keep it at $19,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| if you all approve my budget request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| And I think that will help keep the people we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| and also recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| I'm not going down that road right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Get ready is all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| That was just the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| And I want to also say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| that I reached out to Chair Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| to let you know that this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| what I'm trying to hinder you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| And this is nothing personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| It's a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| And that's just where I have to land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| I'm not questioning your abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| I'm not questioning Chief Purvis' abilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| I'm not questioning any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I don't want it to make it sound like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| that I am when other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| say that they respect you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I totally respect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| But that's just a difference of opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| that we're going to have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| So on this, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| I won't be supporting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| just for those particular reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| And I mean, I hope some of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| will think about it in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Just as a follow-up question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Chief Purvis, don't run off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| The question that I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| about officer-related incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| and corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| and I got the affirmative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| can you give me some indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| of what happened with those incidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Because it is part of our job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| to look at risk and liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| I don't know what incidents that you're referring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| You asked if there was incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| and I said yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| because they happen every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| in a correctional environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| It's a very tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| I'm not trying to minimize that in the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| They deal with a lot of situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| almost every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| It is rare for an officer to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| and go to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| and just coast through a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| and not have a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Could you walk me through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| what some of those typical incidents might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| for the layperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Well, there's a lot of challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| in the correctional environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| as you're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Of course, you're dealing with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| who are incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| They're in there being monitored by our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| They go through, they do checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| to ensure that these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| are in the appropriate places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| doing the appropriate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Many of these individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| do have psychosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| They do have individual problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| that have led them to wind up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| to be inside the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| But we have a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| under the influence of drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Many of them are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| how can I delicately say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| inside their person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| they have drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| We have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| individuals that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| that OD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| We have a lot of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| that are coming in that are suicidal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| A lot of individuals that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| in the most acute moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| of their entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| So there is no doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| that it is extremely challenging for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| And I would like to say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| to what the commissioner said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Just remember, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| it is 93 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| But everybody that we get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| is in a safer environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| I want you to be concerned also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| about the men and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| that are doing the job right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| because we need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| We need individuals in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| to make it a safer environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| They're doing the job every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| coming in and doing the very best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| that they possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| to ensure that they're keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| this community safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| by keeping these individuals incarcerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| and doing above and beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| what we've ever asked of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| which is the helping to do that job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| makes that environment safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| And that's our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| is to make it as safe as we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| for every man and woman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| that is doing that job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| inside the correctional facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Just furthermore, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| I'm really struggling with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| Having a 17-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| and an 18-year-old boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| and also being married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| to an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| who's been a medical director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| over a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| who would tell me stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| of as a 40-plus-year-old man at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| having difficulty navigating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| through the manipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| of these incarcerated individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| And then also as a former HR person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| I would never suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| or recommend to my leadership staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| to make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| based on staffing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| And I hate that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| I just really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| I hate that we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| I'm just really struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Going from 21 to 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4785)|

| 1:20:07| And I've actually spoken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-business?start=4807)|
