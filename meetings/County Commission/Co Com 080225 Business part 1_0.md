| 0:07:34| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| By accepting the chairmanship, I think you've successfully resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| I would start with the nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=463)|

| 0:08:21| but I'm going to decline that because I would have to resign my seat as chairman of Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| But I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=507)|

| 0:09:01| I really appreciate that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| There might be something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=545)|

| 0:09:28| I will respectfully decline, but I appreciate the honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Would you consider nominating Tony Norman, who I consider an exceptional commissioner as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| There's no use in nominating me because I will not accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I appreciate the honors going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| So are the cookies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| They should come back, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| We need them over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Or you need them down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Yeah, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| I'd like to make a motion to denomination cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| I'm probably moved and second that the nomination cease on the one given name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Mike, it seems like if it's just like the chairman, nobody wants it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| At least he's got the right color tie on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=613)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Chairman, if I might take just a moment to thank you, commissioners, for giving me the opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| I look forward to serving you and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to serving under your able leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| And this is, indeed, a historic day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| And I'm just proud to say that we've gone through a lot here in the last few months that have been historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| But this is one of those times where it's really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And I will look forward to serving under your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=650)|
| 0:11:00| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| I have one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| I'd like to put a resolution to honor Mrs. Lois Kelly on her 100th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=665)|
| 0:11:13| Sam, would you like to also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Yes, I'd like to co-sponsor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Co-sponsor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| I have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=680)|
| 0:11:30| We'll put it on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| Mr. Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Yes, I'd like to postpone for 30 days or the next meeting on page 10, R08-2-901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| Since we just got the material today, I think it's unfair for these eight members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Do we have any objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| Commissioner, Vice Chairman, Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Chairman, I have a resolution congratulating Bruce Pearl and the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| I would like, instead of that being from myself personally, that that be from the commission as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| and that we add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Also, I have three other resolutions which I think have been passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| I would ask that those be added to the agenda and discussed at the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=736)|
| 0:12:22| I think you've already been given number 102 for Bruce Pearl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| The other one would be resolution 909, 910, and 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| Are they all on the consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| No, these would be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| Is there anything else that needs to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Mr. Chairman, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I'd like to take personal privilege to say something in reference to the election that I probably misstated in the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=772)|
| 0:13:03| I can do that at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Just in my comments, I think, in regards to the appointment process, I had made several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=787)|
| 0:13:16| or I had made quite an issue about the caretaker role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| And then in some of the appointed seats, such as Mr. Briggs' seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| I had mentioned his name and all his laudatory references and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| And I felt like I at least needed to also mention his opponent in that August election, Mr. Don Sprouls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| And, of course, he is highly qualified, a businessman, a former lawyer, and very well qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| And I just felt like I had been somewhat remiss in not saying anything about Mr. Sprouls at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| So I just wanted to say that, just in fairness to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| We can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| You're withdrawing everything that says to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| I have here, I'd like to add to the agenda, Tennessee Code Annotated 454-5111,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| trying to get us more BEP money that would come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| It looks like we may get $8 million out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So I think the mayor's staff is prepared to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Are you all going to sign the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Do you want to give me what I got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| How do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=884)|
| 0:15:00| Is there anything else that needs to be added or withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| Mr. Chairman, down at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| I've got three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| On Page 9, Resolution 403, we request a 30-day postponement for that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=911)|
| 0:15:20| And on the same page 9, Resolution 404, we would ask that that be withdrawn from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Item 404 on Page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| Motion to withdraw those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=933)|

| 0:16:19| Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| If we could ask on Page 10 if we could have a 30-day deferral on Item 902, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=982)|
| 0:16:32| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Well, Dwight, that was a discussion item that was taken up during the committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and we weren't going to do anything with that today anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| So you want to defer it how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| 30 days, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Well, that would be putting it back on the agenda, and we've already dealt with it at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Fair enough, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I do think we would look for us to reintroduce it for the March agenda, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| in the event that it's not rolled for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| because we wanted to get some information about it out to the new commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| But that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| If it's not on the agenda for action tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| then we'll either reintroduce it in March or April or come back to you with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I think that would be appropriate for you all just to come back when you're ready to present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1040)|

| 0:17:23| but I'd ask the finance director, Mr. Troyer, to come with the projections of revenue for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1043)|
| 0:17:31| Are we on target or is the economy soft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| And he's coming with that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| The green waste facility, you were coming with how much money that we have lost by not collecting the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:46| So whenever that's appropriate for the administration to tell us about, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1073)|

| 0:22:23| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| I don't know if anybody is here to provide us some counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| but the FCC, which is the Federal Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| they said that Nextel's wireless network interfered with the public safety of 800 megahertz systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| and they've been deliberating over this for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| And I was wondering, they said that it has caused nationwide interferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| and I was wondering how old these units are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| And I was also wanting to know where the county is in rebanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| because there is a prioritization of waves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and I was wanting to know if there's anybody here to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1377)|

| 0:23:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| I see Doug Dillingham out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I got a question about the Cedar Bluff Elementary construction project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| If I could ask him a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1428)|
| 0:24:00| It's 202.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| 201 was going to be heard during the regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| You recall we had a meeting out of Cedar Bluff when we talked about the parking situation out there and the traffic flow at Cedar Bluff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Does this money take care of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Does it take or is this strictly for the building itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| This is strictly for the building itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| parking and a traffic flow problem because we had a child hit by a car on his way to school just outside the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:39| And we do need to address that at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| But you'd have to come back before us later, would you not, for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| Or have you resolved it in another way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| We have not resolved it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| We need to look into this in conjunction with the county because we can take a look at tying into any sidewalk that may be installed by the county in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:07| And that's where I understood that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| But we also talked about that there's a problem with the traffic flow and the parking on the school site itself, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Right, which we are going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| We are looking into addressing part of that with speed humps, some of the things that we had discussed in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| As long as you all are looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1528)|

| 0:25:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Doug, one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| On the sidewalks, do we have an estimate of how much it would cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Because we had had a meeting about the possibility of putting in some sidewalks around Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| Commissioner, at this point in time, we do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Again, we need to probably have a meeting with Mr. Weitrick, take a look at what we need to do off of our campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| and then we can tie in at that point and come up with a price on how to route the kids the way that we need to to get them from that point into our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:09| So we're prepared to do that at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| Any other motions to approve the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| I think we already had those, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| We got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Ivan Harmon made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| We just agreed to withdraw 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| All for approval, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| And properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Elections and appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| Resolution 110 is approving the appointment of Thomas Deakins to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Intergovernmental had no recommendation at 5-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| 5-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| I will move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| Properly moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| By means of background, the Board of Education met and asked that Mr. Deakins be appointed to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| That would give us ten members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| The Ethics Committee voted to keep the number at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| And in our last meeting, our law director told us that in order to add someone, we had to change our policy first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| What I have before you is consideration of a change in the ethics policy with regard to the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| And basically what it says is that the composition of the Ethics Committee would include a constitutional county officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1672)|
| 0:28:00| or a member of the Board of Education that would keep the number at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| And, Mr. Law Director, you and I had a conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| If you would address this as well as to exactly how this would work in terms of the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| But the first thing would be to amend the ethics policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| And I have no problem with Mr. Deakins being on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| It's a matter of amending the policy to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| I mean, what you have before you is a small change in Section 4 of the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| where basically right now it says one countywide constitutional county officer of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| appointed mutually by the Knox County Mayor and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| The change is to add in or a Knox County Board of Education member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| So it will read one countywide constitutional county officer of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| or a Knox County Board of Education member appointed mutually by the Knox County Mayor and the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| Should no countywide constitutional officer or Knox County Board of Education member be willing to accept the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| an additional member of the Knox County Commission or a member of any other board, committee, commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| and so on and so forth shall be appointed mutually by the commission and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| So the change is just to add in Knox County Board of Education member to that one designation within the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| It does not automatically put on the board, put on that committee, Thomas Deakins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| but it gives you the ability to put Thomas Deakins on the board along as the mayor agrees with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| instead of a constitutional county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I like Thomas Deakins as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Campaigned with him all summer a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| My problem with this is that it gets to an even number, which makes tie votes possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| How can we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Could we make him a, I don't know, like an alternate where if only eight show up, he can fill in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| How can we handle the tie-breaking issue right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Lambert, you want to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| You really have two things before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| One, you have this resolution, which has received a motion for approval and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| which basically adds a tenth member to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| And it does make it a little bit unwieldy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| And the committee itself has voted on it and expressed their desire not to have a ten-person committee, to keep it at nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:53| So Commissioner Hammond has proposed by separate resolution, R-08-2-911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1853)|
| 0:31:01| that we change the ethics policy to give you the ability to appoint a Knox County Board of Education member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:10| instead of the one constitutional county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Right now, we have a constitutional county officer, Miss Martha Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| who is the person designated for that slot on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| And she is on there through August the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| This would give you the ability to appoint someone after that date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| and that someone could certainly be a Board of Education member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| That's the change that Commissioner Hammond is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| It does not at this moment put Thomas Deakins on the Board of Education on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:51| So how does that affect the other resolution about putting him on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| Basically, you would need to, in order to effectuate Commissioner Hammond's 9-11 resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:08| you would need to deny the 1-10, Resolution 1-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:16| If, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| If you approve Thomas Deakins, if you approve 1-10, then you've added a tenth member on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| I mean, that's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| 1-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| What if, say, someone that's one of the members decided to resign their seat on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| Could we then come back if we approve 9-11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Could we then come back and appoint Commissioner Deakins or a school board member Deakins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| Yes, so long as they fit within the categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| There are several categories within our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| If you recall, the mayor can select two citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| The commission can select two citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| The mayor can select one county commissioner, and the commission can select one county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| where we get up to nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| This just adds that additional person who may fill that slot instead of the county constitutional officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| It's an or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| It's an or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| If the constitutional officer decided to resign, then we could go back to school board member Deakins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=1998)|
| 0:33:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| With the consent of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| It's a mutual appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| I guess if we change 9-11 just a little bit and put Knox County constitutional officer or change the or to an and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:48| and we increase the number to ten, how many meetings, Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| have you had all ten members show up that you could potentially have a tiebreaker, a dead tie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| As it stands now, most of our meetings we've had eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| We have not had the ninth member at most of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| So right now we have had eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| So most of your meetings now could have ended up in ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| It still takes five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| But to change this would change this going forward as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| because come September 1 we'll be reappointing or appointing a whole new ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| and you could possibly have all ten members showing up at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| And?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Well, I'm just saying you could have, as, like, Commissioner Lambert said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| if you had ten members and you run into the possibility of a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| And if they tie, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Then it's, I guess, anything that came before them would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| It would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| It would fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Not if they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Well, if it was five to five, whatever motion was in front of them would be a failed vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Yes, but at the end of the day, what can they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| I mean, if you've got six-five or. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| I'm just saying you'd have a tie vote and it would be a failed motion, whatever it was, if you have a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| I'm not saying it's good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:10| I'm just saying you just have a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| I'm just saying at the end of the day, what difference does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I mean, what's the outcome if you have a five-four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| I mean, where does it continue to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| I assume that you'd still have to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Actually, I think you'd have to have six regardless, would you not, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| if it's a ten-member because would you not have, if it's a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| It depends on if you're talking about a nine-member or a ten-member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| If we have a ten-member committee. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Could you not make the vote six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Then it would take six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| If you have a ten-member, it would take. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Just like this. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Yeah, just like this body, if it had. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| We're 19 members now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| It takes ten votes no matter if we have 19, 18, 17 members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Because the point of it is I think we should have a constitutional county official if they decide to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| and someone from the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| And then you end up with a majority of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| So I don't see where that causes any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| I'm just telling you what it takes for a motion to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I'm not saying it's good or bad, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| Well, I support putting Mr. Deakins on there and us doing whatever we need to do to change the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| And, you know, it just makes a majority of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| So I guess on Resolution 9-11, if a friendly amendment to Commissioner Hammond would be changed or to an and and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:38| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I was going to say I personally don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| I'm just following the dictates of the Ethics Committee and trying to do their wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| I personally do not have a problem with adding Mr. Deakins on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Mr. Law Director, would it be appropriate to put Mr. Deakins on as an alternate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| And let's go ahead and approve this for August, but put him on right now as an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| We don't have any provision in our policy for alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| So, you know, you can create it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| You know, the Knox County Ethics Policy is a creation of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| You can change it any way you please on one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| You know, you just tell me whatever your wishes are and we'll make sure the changes get made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| If you wish to create, you know, an alternate member, we've not had one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| We would have to create a provision for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| If you wish to add a tenth member, we can add an additional paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| and we can make that a commission appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| and that be the selection of a Knox County Board of Education member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| with or without the consent of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| You can do it as your appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| It's your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Well, Commissioner Hammond well knows we've had one member there, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| was there the first meeting and hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Am I correct on that, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| And I just thought if we put him on as an alternate, if we could in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| then in August we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Is the reason that you're adding someone from the Board of Education to have an education perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| or what is the rationale behind adding someone from the Board of Education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| They met and voted to ask that a person from the board be added to the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| and they asked that their representative be Thomas Deacons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I do not know all of the details as to why, except they wanted representation, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:52| It was partially an education perspective, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| That was their desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| And also he's an exceptionally good individual for the task and that was their thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| And I realize that Kim Waller is on there, but she brings a slightly different perspective than the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| They're from the administrative side of the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| I think that perspective needs to be considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| And I think they make a good case, and that's why I hope we can add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Is she on there as a citizen or how was she appointed onto there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| I believe she was one of the citizen appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Wasn't she one of the mayor's appointees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| With the Board of Education, they're one of the, or not one of, they are the largest employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2373)|
| 0:39:41| And we have representation from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| And also I believe Mike Duncan from the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| It only makes sense to me that we have someone, instead of an and or situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| is that we have a school board person on this panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2394)|
| 0:40:04| How we do it, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| If we add ten, I like the size of a nine-member board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| But if we have to add the tenth one to do it, I'd like to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| I'd like to support Thomas Dinkin at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| Your light is still on, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| I'll go ahead and make a motion that we go ahead and add the paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| and make it a constitutional county officer and a Knox County Board of Education member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| and whatever the law director thinks we need to put in there would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| We already have a motion on the floor to approve Thomas Dinkin's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Yes, but we've got to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| Does the maker of the motion want to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| Let me just understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| We already have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Well, you can make that a substitute motion, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Well, we've got two different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Do we need to do them separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| I think we need to do them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| I will make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| I would suggest we invert the order, first make the change that Commissioner Moore suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and then consider Mr. Dinkin's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| So I will withdraw solely for the purpose of reintroducing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| I don't want it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| And I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| We'll second also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| We'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| I second it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Well, no, Commissioner Moore, we're back to you and your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| Yeah, but I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| And then we'll come back to putting Mr. Dinkin's on after we vote on yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Okay, now, Scott, you have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Motion for us to change and have a, to include a constitutional county officer of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| and a Knox County Board of Education member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Okay, now we're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| That would be 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| As specified in 9-11, that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| You're admitting 9-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| We'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Are there any questions on 9-11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Yeah, let me make sure I understand it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| So this goes to a ten-member ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| And then a majority would be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| You know, I know it's not going to come up very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| I still have a problem with the tie situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Could we add some language that if they're in the event of a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| They have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| They'll never be a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| They have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| A tie is still a failed motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| A tie is still a failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| They have to have six votes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| I mean, I was just thinking, could a tie send it to this commission or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| Please, let's not add a level of complexity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Your light's still on, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| We have a motion on the floor to amend it to ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| And what else was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| That tenth person had to be a school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Tenth person had to be a school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| And is that tenth person, we'll fit them within paragraph four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| So we're going to change the or to and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| So I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Or to and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| And it's also a member that is approved by this commission and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2592)|
| 0:43:19| So will the mayor approve of Thomas Deakins will be the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| He says he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Could I have a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Is this getting too complicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Could I amend it to where the school board appoints this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| The school board has requested this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| I don't think this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Well, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| I mean, in the future, that this appointment be a school board appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| since it's going to be coming from their body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| I mean, the ethics committee affects them as much as it does us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| That's okay with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| I'm a maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| If the second would agree, I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| I'll agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| I guess if you just add the language that the school board would send their nominee to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:12| To be confirmed by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| And to be confirmed by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| And the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| And the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| You approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| You okay with that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| I think everyone knows what the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Now we can go back to, do we need to go back to Deakins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| Make a motion to place Thomas Deakins on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| Item 11 is appointing members to the health insurance appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I have no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Five-zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Five-zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I'd ask that members submit names to the county commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| and I don't think we've had any names submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| So I guess on both these items, this one and the next one as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| if we could defer it for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| and give commissioners another opportunity to submit them to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| Because there are some guidelines that they have to meet on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| certainly on the first one on the insurance appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| I'm wondering is there a way that we can send this information out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| organizations or bodies that do this type of thing so that they would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| that there is an appointment available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| I guess Commissioner Smith, since you're in the insurance business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I mean are there organizations or people we could maybe get some names from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| or some suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Yeah, they're located in the 640 building, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| But, yeah, there's health insurance associations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Could we make a motion then to send a letter to, I guess, the insurance association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| whatever they name it, asking for recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| So instead of simply just withdrawing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| why don't we make a substitute motion that we ask that the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| send a letter to the insurance association asking for a nomination for this position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| I'll get a second on that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| All in favor for writing a letter to the health insurance people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| And also deferring this until we hear back from that association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| That doesn't mean that's the only people that can make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| No, but we're just asking for a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| But also it's a member with benefit administration experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| and then a citizen member with financial management experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| Put that in the letter, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Well, I'm going to ask that that be part of the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| You want to make that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Yes, put that in my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| So that they meet the qualifications of the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| We have a motion on the floor to send out information and letters to the health field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2855)|

| 0:49:47| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| We have no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:12| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| Is Mr. Napier still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| I know we withdrew whatever resolution he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| but I asked him to come down to speak to us for a brief minute on TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| and the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| I know it's been on a lot of our minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| and a lot of us talked about it at Intergovernmental and Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| Mr. Herb Slater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| I'm Todd Napier with the Development Corporation of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| 17 Market Square, number 201, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| I am here tonight as staff to the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| which is what the Development Corporation does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Also with me is Herbert Slatery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Herbert is legal counsel to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| What we wanted to do was to just give you a brief overview of TIF process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| We'd like an opportunity to come back in to address you in workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| although I've been told you have a lot of those already scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| so perhaps we could do that in committee meetings at next month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| if that's more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| What we'd also do at that is to go over the pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| which the Industrial Development Board also manages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| The policies and procedures were adopted by the Industrial Development Board in June of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| and we held a workshop with the county commission in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I'm going to have Herbert come up here and go through the process that we have adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| for properly following a TIF through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| and then I'll give you a brief update on where we as the Industrial Development Board see we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| on the two that you've already considered and the one that was withdrawn tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:14| And you've got a package that we've distributed that has those policies and procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| and on the last page there's a flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| Mr. Chairman, I'm Herbert Slatery, Post Office Box 2047, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you for the opportunity to address you on this TIF program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| There's a flow chart that Todd just referred to on the back of the packet that might be helpful for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| I'll just try to be brief, and if you've got questions, we can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| I think a lot of this information and the detail is much more suitable in a workshop setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| or a committee meeting where there can be more give and take and there's more time available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| But the procedures that we worked through with commission in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| contemplate basically two actions by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| What we wanted to do was to get a full application package to you with a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:17| some evaluations, perhaps some reports from engineers about the proposed project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| and take that application with an inducement resolution to you to ask you basically one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| one or two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| The first question would be whether you would entertain an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| And the second question would be whether the public infrastructure improvements are of such importance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:54| and significance to you that you would like to see them done in this development funded by tax increments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3234)|
| 0:54:02| rather than from the developer or applicant financing and paying for the improvements itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| And our thinking there is that TIFs, their basic purpose is to provide public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| It's a way of doing, you may call it off balance sheet financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| It's not something that's going to be funded in your capital program necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| It's an opportunity to make some improvements with a development that will facilitate not only the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:37| but what's going to be happening for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| and the adjustments that the citizens of Knox County will experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| So the first hearing would be we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| the industrial development board would actually bring you the application and a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| So if it doesn't come from the IDB, it's coming from somewhere else outside of these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| and procedures that we've established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| And we're trying just to follow the procedures that we've talked with you in July about to the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| Assuming that it does come to us, does come from us, you would be having a summary, a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| We think that it will help you decide and evaluate that initial decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| which would be to come back and tell the industrial development board we would appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| and request us to put together an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:33| And if I can just back up just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| only the commission can actually approve and allocate tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| approve those revenues for this particular purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| That's not the role of the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| That's your role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And we don't want to infringe on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| We want to serve and help you get to that point where you feel like you're making a very reasoned decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:57| The role of the IDB is to initiate the economic impact plan under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| And the economic impact plan has a number of statutory criteria that we've got to provide to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| but we will provide some additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| and come back to you a second time and present that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| And it's when you approve the economic impact plan that the tax increment financing will eventually be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| And then our board's next role would be to administer that particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| That's the basic procedures on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And I could go into more detail, but I hesitate to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| You're going to have probably a long meeting, and I'll be happy to answer questions if you have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| or we can go into any kind of detail you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| I've sort of had the flu, so just bear with me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| The one question that I had and raised the last time is that the Hardin Valley project, I'll call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| and it seems like that plan has a whole lot of merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| But now the timeliness of it is we're faced with a pretty prompt decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| As I understand it from the applicant, he submitted this plan in his words in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| Now we get it now, and, you know, he's wanting a 30 or 60-day decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| Whatever it is that you're going to do or will do, you know, we've sort of got a smoking gun here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Turn down a project maybe with merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| What's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| There's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| There's a problem in the time flow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| Todd is a little more up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I'll let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Also, I think he said that he went to you, then you asked him to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| It looks like that's a little, you know, wishy-washy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| If you have a plan, why didn't it go by the plan and we didn't get it sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| Gary's a great guy, and I think he's got all the best intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| When he submitted his application, it was incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| It was asked for more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| The application review committee listened to him, but there was no action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| We just got the remainder of that information last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| And so the process is when we have all the information that is asked for in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| we've had a chance to send it over to the mayor's office, to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| and to the different departments for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Then we will send it on to county commission for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| But you understand my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| We're now faced with a project with merit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| or if we don't vote for it then there's going to be a Kroger's store there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| There seems to be a flaw somewhere in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| I can't speak to the flaw, but that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| It sounds like there's a timing issue with this project and when it was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and when he needs to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| But we met, I guess, last week or the week before with the industrial development board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| and they felt like we needed to follow the process because as soon as we didn't follow the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| everyone was going to ask for the same exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| We've got three, if you count the Hardin Valley partner application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| Well, we've got three applications actually in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Todd, can you speak to the two TIFs that were sent to you by commission in the halls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:46| Is that, I guess, not brought to you in proper form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:54| or would you all wish that we would not be sending requests to you to look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| Or is IDB okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:04| I mean, you tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| What the IDB board stressed at the last meeting was that we wanted to follow the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| and the policy and the procedures they adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| which was for us as staff to receive the application, to review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| to make sure that all the information was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Once that information was there, that we had a chance to look at it, get input on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| was then to send it to you all so that you had the full knowledge of what it is you're approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| and that all the information, you know, approving or not approving, to send on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| You had that at your purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Without it, we believe that it's really not fair to you to make a decision on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| or not it has merit to send on for IDB consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:50| So long and short of it is, our preference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| and the way we would like to handle it is for it to come from us to you on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| Do you ever see a time like, say, the one here on Still Road, if, say, time is of the essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:11| that maybe we need to at some times say we want the IDB to go ahead and look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| or do you think we still should follow the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| The IDB within their policy and procedures has the ability to make exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| What I heard pretty clearly was that they didn't want to start making exceptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| certainly at this point because you make an exception for one that is going to be expected by everybody else that's applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:43| So the preference is to wait until we hear from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3711)|

| 1:02:37| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3757)|

| 1:02:42| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Then property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| John, what do we hope to gain from this audit or this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| From the study, we want to update our cost allocation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| And what that is going to do is give us the most recent and up-to-date methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| so that we can maximize the overhead that we can charge to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| And so this will help be a positive revenue item for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| When you say maximize the overhead that you can charge grants, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| We're allowed overhead on certain grants, and that's just a part of the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:30| and we want to make sure that that's as high as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| So if I understand this correctly, excuse me for interrupting, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| there are certain fixed costs of county government that, in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| you're maybe allowed a little bit here on this grant, a little bit here on that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| And what you're trying to do is move them around to get the maximum bang for the buck out of our grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| to squeeze as much of that out of the grant givers as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| And so in the long run, this expense will probably come back many times over in reduced overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| I'm buying your argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| At a university where they do that all the time, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| With a motion on the floor to approve, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| Resolution 803 is approving a contract with Lewis H. Jones CPA for professional auditing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| for the Knox County Medical Examiner's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| Voted, no recommendation, 5-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Finance approved with Knox County with an amendment on it for the Knox County Auditor to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| 5-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Probably moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| Are we approving it with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Approving it with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| That's what my second is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| I don't know what the maker of the motion was approving it with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| I just want to note that we have been in contact with Richard Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| and he is aware of our time frame and our approach and is going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| And, John, you were going to, I see you gave us this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| Are we doing autopsies in Knox County from outside the county and not getting reimbursed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| Mike Harms, 11913 Wisconsin, Chase Circle, Chief of Staff to the County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| I guess the answer to that is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| And if I could spend 30 seconds maybe telling you the background on the medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| A medical examiner is appointed by the county and confirmed by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| Guidelines are laid out and Tennessee code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| In Knox County, for instance, Commissioner Moore, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| previously we had a doctor who was not a pathologist serving as a medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| That medical examiner, when that person made the decision that an autopsy was to be performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| it was done by the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| specifically by their Pathology Service Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| which runs the forensic autopsy services for the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| A lot of autopsies are performed at that university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| and I think there's probably about 500 a year there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Only 100 of those are basically Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| So over the last three years I think we've done like 91, 99, 100 or so of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| That's a regional center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| So Dr. Elkins, when she performs an autopsy, is not paid by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| She is paid by that corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| She's paid by Knox County as our medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| So she wore two hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Actually, she wore three hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| One, she was employed by the University of Tennessee Teaching Hospital as a pathologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| and she served as a faculty member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| So, in essence, that's why we're doing this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| It's a very convoluted set of operations over there, but we believe it's a good operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| We do not own the morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| We do not own the pathology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| The University of Tennessee Hospital owns that morgue and the pathology department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| so they can perform as many autopsies there as they choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| and actually basically they're marketing that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| I'm trying to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| What is the second page you handed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Like in 2007, $165,100 for 127 autopsies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:53| If you divide that into 127, is that the cost of an autopsy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4073)|
| 1:08:03| If it's $1,300, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| What's 127 times $1,300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| About $1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| We roughly are charged $1,300 for an autopsy by the University Pathology Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| which is the same thing they charge roughly for an autopsy from someone from Anderson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| or Blount County or any of the surrounding counties they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| We are concerned with an autopsy being a fixed price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| I mean, it's almost like when you go to a dentist, you don't get a fixed price to go to a dentist, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| which costs more to have your teeth filled or cavity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| or an extraction versus a cleaning or a crown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| So part of this study is to determine the cost per unit of services that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| But going back to this point, the last thing Knox County would want to do is set up our own pathology service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| and our own morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| That would be very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| One other point I want to make about this audit is shared jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| It's co-funded by Knox County and by their pathology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| That was my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Do we not have employees that we pay over there besides Dr. Elkins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Dr. Elkins has hired other employees as part of her medical examiner staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:30| And we do know that they performed work on other autopsies for citizens outside of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| So that's one of the questions we want to get resolved through this audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| How many employees do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| Five full-time, six part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| And do you know what their total budget is on the county side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| $780,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Plus the $165,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| That is part of it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Plus the $165,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Or is that in the $780,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| It's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| So what we'll be looking at is the cost of maintaining that whole operations of a morgue, pathology services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:25| There's another company, Dynacare, that does a certain piece of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| So we're going to look at five different entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| determine the total cost basis of what Knox County is receiving for its $780,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4232)|
| 1:10:40| and hopefully determine if, in fact, we're getting a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| Hospital, thanks for getting a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Commissioner Lucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| Mr. Arms, I guess the essence of it is that we have these five full-time, six part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| They're Knox County employees, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Are we being compensated by any of these, by either UT or UT teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| or whatever the other services that they're doing for doing autopsies outside of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:21| Currently, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| That's what we're trying to determine, if it's a bargain, using a common word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| if it's a bargain to have that many employees versus us having our own morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| We're not being charged for a morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| We're not being charged for a pathology department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| An analogy would be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| If the sheriff has jailers but doesn't own the jail or doesn't own the cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4299)|
| 1:11:44| or doesn't own any of the laundry services for the jail, how much does it cost to keep it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| But I guess the question is, do we have county employees doing work for other entities without being reimbursed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4311)|
| 1:12:02| Or is our contract that we provide this work to have these facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| Well, our contract has been in place a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Part of this is review this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| We know there's holes in that contract because this has evolved over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:21| And we want to, as a result of this audit, we want to come out with a new contract that makes herself whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| Well, I think it's a good idea to have this audit so that we can get to the bottom of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| and have these answers because I'm still not sure that my questions are fully answered or Commissioner Moore's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| So I think we need to pass this so we can find out what's going on over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| and we can have a clear explanation in how we need to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I just want to point out that because this is indirectly tied to my employer, the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| I will refrain from debate and abstain from vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| What you're trying to say is Ms. Elkins works for the university, too, so she can do these autopsies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| She's working three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| We're paying in under her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| They have no authority unless it's in the contract to perform autopsies with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| So, I mean, Dr. Elkins is wearing two or three hats, but these other employees, from my understanding, are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| So that's why I think we need this audit done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:43| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I've got a question for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| John, on this right here, when you have police investigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| or you're trying to determine homicides, suicides, my understanding is that we don't have a licensed pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4432)|
| 1:14:01| Does that necessitate that UT does that to make it official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| No, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| You know, Dr. Elkins is certainly a licensed pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Okay, she's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| That's one of her hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Do we have a number for this, how much this is going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| It's not in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| $25,000, I believe, is to be split between us and UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| So the cost to the county is $12,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| I've got one more question for Mr. Orms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| So I'm just trying to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Say if, like, Campbell County had 39 in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| 39 autopsies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| So you've got a medical examiner, I guess, in Campbell County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Some counties are having trouble getting medical examiners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| We followed the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Anderson County has basically resigned, and they have trouble finding one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Okay, well, let's say they have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| We don't know, but for the sake of it, we'll say they have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| And they send the body to the regional center, and they're charged $1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| It looks like it would be cheaper for us just to send them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| and pay the $1,300 at $165 instead of the employees and all that for $780| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| if the rest of the counties around us are doing the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| That is one of the things we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Of course, our Attorney General, our law enforcement team in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:42| feels it's very advantageous to have a medical examiner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| who is also a certified pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Previously, we did not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| So our current medical examiner and the deputy, Doctor, what's your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| Manousnik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Are both pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| And I guess an example of the Jonah Berry case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| the recent high profile of Ed Dossett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| our medical examiner is also a pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| So if you talk to our current Attorney General, they feel that's very advantageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:24| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Let me clarify this just for the rest of the people here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| because I may have a little bit better understanding what some of these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| A pathologist is someone who has done training in pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| He's a physician, almost always they're a medical doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| To practice their profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| which may be looking at slides to determine cancer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| or interpreting bone marrow biopsies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| they have to have a medical license to practice in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| Pathologists, because of their training, can also be board certified in pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| What a medical examiner is, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| he's a person that's done additional training beyond the basic pathology training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| to become a medical examiner where he can testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| as to whether there's been criminal activity or other causes of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| He determines the cause of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| So he's someone that has additional training beyond just being a pathologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| I think, is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| And I would doubt, I don't know this for a fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| that many of these, there's not too many medical examiners around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| who actually have done the subspecialty training in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| And I would doubt if some of these smaller counties have someone who's actually board certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| or has done additional training to become medical examiners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| Now, you do have the coroners, you know, which are a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| And they, in some counties, may not even be physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| They'll have medical examiners who do the work for them, make the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| but then they're the ones that would actually testify in court on the basis of the autopsy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| that was done as far as to the cause of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| And just one other thing, just to make it clear in my mind, is what the audit's trying to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| It sounds as if we've had county employees who are working over at UT, some are part-time, some are full-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| and sort of as an in-kind compensation for the work that they may be doing beyond the work they're doing for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4703)|
| 1:18:31| we've said that by us using the facilities, by us not having a morgue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| by us not having the expertise of maybe some of the other people in the pathology department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| is that they have done this in-kind work, I'll call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| which may or may not balance out what they're providing as far as facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| One of the things that the audit is intending to determine is really is this a balanced relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| or has it just been a gentleman's agreement for a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| That's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| And, for instance, our medical examiner, Dr. Elkins, has free office space at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| So we're trying to look at that balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| And when this audit is finished, and Dr. Van Meter at UT, he is just as concerned about this issue as we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4757)|
| 1:19:27| We've been looking at it now for over six months and determined the best thing to do is do the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| see where it lays, and that's why they're anxious to get this behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| And then we'll come forward after the audit, as Commissioner Leuthold says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| and we'll know roughly what it cost us to perform an autopsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4782)|

| 1:19:49| Mr. Arms, did I understand you to correct to say this budget is $780,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| That includes the autopsies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:01| And we're getting our rent free, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| She has office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| Office space, of course, use of the morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| We're the big player in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| What I'm saying is if we're getting all these things free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| I'd like to have a breakdown of what this $780,000 is, how it's being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| We can get that easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| I'd appreciate it if you'd get that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I think we can have that right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| We have a motion on the floor to approve with the Mounds County Auditor's Assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| And one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| We need to go back and have two things added to the record that were on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:54| This resolution is to honor Lois Kelly on her 100th birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| And Resolution 102 is congratulating Coach Bruce Pearl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| and the University of Tennessee Volunteers for their victory over the Memphis Tigers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| and becoming number one in men's basketball for the first time in school history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:18| Next we have 201 on page 8 at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:27| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| appropriating $160,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| and approving a memorandum of understanding with the Benton County Fire Protection District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| number two, for the purchase of 320 handheld and mobile 800 MHC radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Intergovernmental approved 5-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Finance approved 5-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| 5-0, but wasn't that the one that Mr. Freeze had pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Yes, she had pulled, but we never did talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| Can I get a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Yes, I'm doing the math on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Are these new or used radios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| They're used radios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| $500 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| $500 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Are these handheld radios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| That, I mean, I bought aviation radios, nautical radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| That seems a bit high compared to what are these similar in makeup to the marine band radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| and the aviation band radios and things that I may have purchased in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:50| because $500 seems about like a new price, not a used price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| Actually, Chairman, can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Actually, $500 is a very, very cheap price for this type of radio from what I've tried to research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| but I do want to know how old they are and what happened with the rebanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| because the FCC, they did have some public safety issues, and they've studied this for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| And Sprint and Nextel is responsible because there was cellular phone towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| and there was a lot of conflict with using these and that jeopardized public safety in using these radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| And that was resolved in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Sprint and Nextel had to post a bond for $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| So a solution is there, but the process is extremely slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| And so I just wanted to know for Knox County where we are in the rebanding of these waves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| and how old these units are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Well, we have Mr. Thomas from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Bob Thomas, 5325 Beverly Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| And I also have Ron McPherson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| Ron is our executive director for finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| And both of us reside across the street at the A.J. most of the time, but that's a residential address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| Some very good questions, Commissioners, on these radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| First, let me go back and say it is totally driven by the rebanding process that is taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| And these radios that we currently have, fortunately for us, have been loaned to us by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| And they have loaned them to us for some period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| But as you were saying, the recall on these, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| the police department is going to be taking these radios back because they are their radios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| and then they will be replaced by the vendor at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Of course, it would leave us without radios with that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| And these are three years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| None older than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Some are newer than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| What I've been told, the retail price on these ranges anywhere from $2,400 to $2,700 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| So $500 is, from what I understand, a good price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| We didn't want to purchase a pig and a poke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| So we asked Motorola out in Washington State to look at these radios to certify them for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| They will also have to look at them again because they will have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| It's something to do with the banding out there that they will have to look at them once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| What we're asking for you to approve is, of course, for us to purchase these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| This way the school system will have its own radios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| There will be no frequency issues, again, from what I've been told, that will interfere with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| It will operate totally on the school frequency that's been allocated to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| So, again, I don't know if that answers all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| Bob Thomas, what state did you say that these are coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| Washington State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| It's Benton County, I think, in Washington State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| The fire department, they're transitioning to some new equipment that would operate on a lower band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:56| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| Mr. Thomas, what kind of accessories are coming with these radio units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| Gosh, Commissioner, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| This is not going to make, as far as I know about radios and others, 87 MCS2000 dash mounts, 11 MCS2000 dash mounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:20| There's 190, I think, portable, the base radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| Batteries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Batteries, charger units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| It's really, I think, from what, again, I've been told, Officer Bill Key is our radio technician person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| but he assures me that we're getting a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| And we didn't want to just take his word for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| so we wanted Motorola to look at these to certify them, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| because $160,000 is a lot of money, even if it is a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Yes, and I had looked into that, and the prices were very, very expensive for these units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| and the $500 actually kind of caught my attention because I thought that was rather cheap for these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| And I did notice out in Washington they do have a different prioritization of waves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| which is different than the section that we are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| But if you talk to some radio specialists who can reconfigure and re-band those radios, I'm sure they'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| And thank you for answering the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Thank you for your consideration on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5249)|

| 1:27:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:47| Resolution 903 is approving the second amendment to the lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5267)|

| 1:27:57| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Intergovernmental, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5279)|

| 1:28:05| Can I get a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| I'd make a motion we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| I asked you to look up about the contract to see if there were supposed to be taxes paid on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| Yes, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| And that's the one thing I haven't done, I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Give me five minutes and I'll look at it right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| While you're looking there, I'd like to talk to Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| I'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| Doug, now, are we taking our rent money from the old facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| plus the new facilities to pay for this property that you're supposed to be giving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| We projected, I think, around 15 years to pay for the debt of the property, the new property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Also, looking at this year on this TV appraisal fees there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| we're having to pay $313,750 out of pocket just to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5346)|
| 1:29:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| And that is a requirement coming from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I understand, but we're having to pay it to taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| Well, you know, on the way that he finds about the taxes, I asked him to have that and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| You know, we're taking in roughly $106,000 a year rent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| Now, on the new one there, the first ten years, it looks to me like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:45| now you correct me if I'm correct, we're going to be paying, we're taking in a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| but yet that's all we're getting to pay towards our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Yeah, the total debt for the package is a little over $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| You see on the summary sheet there, we're about $2.2 million is estimated to pay for the entire deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5403)|
| 1:30:08| And then in the next ten years, it's basically the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Why have we raised this up to a 50-year lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| That was proposed by the Campbells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| It currently is about a 45-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| It's 25 years with two 10-year options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| So I would assume that because of the additional investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| they would like a longer term with no breaks in there for options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| You know, as I asked you once before on the taxes on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| and I'm going to get into this while he's gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| it's my understanding when any government entity leases land out, it goes on at the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:51| For the leaser to pay taxes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| You know, this started out in 2005 with only $1,198 in taxes being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5455)|
| 1:31:03| It fell in 2006 to $579, and all we're getting now is $764.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| Now, that seems awful low for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| That's being lakefront property and being commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| That was TVA says it has to be changed to commercial even on this other floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| So I'm taking for granted that the old marina is on commercial too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| And that's supposed to be assessed at 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| I just can't see where these taxes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| And we've only got this property appraised at $94,725 and assessed at $28,417.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:43| You know, Commissioner Hammond came up and talked about this $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| I mean, it's 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| It's appraised at $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| But when you get into lakefront property, you're talking about anywhere to half a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| sometimes close to a million dollars for a lot, not just an acre, a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| You know, I think we need to be awful careful on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| We've got this property down there that everybody is using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| We're limiting the number of people that this property will be available for for recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:15| We're taking on lease default could mean we have to accept the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| We're limiting use of the you've got it all down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I don't have to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| But it increases commercial development on that river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| And, really, we're denying a lot of the taxpayers in Knox County a place to go where we have lakefront property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:35| You know, we've got a little place over here on Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| What does it consist of, Doug, two-and-a-half acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| And Karkallen Park, that's one on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Is that the only lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| No, we have several parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| And we probably in total there's probably, oh, gosh, seven, 800 acres of land on the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5571)|
| 1:32:57| that was all given to us from TVA in the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| So we do have quite a bit of land on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| I'm really concerned here on this administrative fees is $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| You know, they're offering to pay $15,000 of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| But on the $313,000, we're just paying it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:19| I just can't see where in Knox County the Knox County taxpayers are benefiting any whatsoever on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| I mean, we're stringing this out to 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| And you're saying, well, you give me a projection year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| That's if they're still in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| If they're not, we're going to have to feed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| That could be true, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| I mean, I'm going by what you're saying down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Yeah, and it's just our best estimate on what the future would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Let's wait and see what the taxes are on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| I'm concerned about the way this property is assessed down there, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I feel like we haven't been getting our fair tax dollar for all these years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| And I'm not blaming the Campbells on it because all they're doing is they're taking assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| come out of the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| No, they come out of the property assessor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Property assessor's office and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| But that seems like I'd like to own that property and it be appraised at $94,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| I guess I need to wait for the law director to get back before I can ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| I think it might be helpful to do a little history on this so that the new people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| and so that the folks who perhaps are watching fully understand what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| As you know, we approved the YMCA to be built down at that area down Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| Before that, it was a swimming pool area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| And it was a place where I know that we spent many birthdays there with my children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| and spent many afternoons there because it was a great place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| But, frankly, it became in a state of disrepair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| and legal liabilities were such that the county made the decision to close the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| And so the YMCA came to us and said we would like to build a facility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| We approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| TVA came back and said that they would not accept the Y being put on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| So the property basically has been sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| The Campbells came to Knox County, as I understand it, and said we already have a marina there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| And when you look at the property, they were wanting to expand the marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| to put some additional boat slips there and also put in a dry storage facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| As you know, Knox County is right in the middle of an area where a lot of boats are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| And so a lot of people own boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| And so there is a definite need for a dry storage facility as well as additional slips down at that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| When you look at that property, you can't go down and build a condo there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| You can't build a cabin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:45| You can't really build anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| But it is lakefront property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| So the Campbells came and said, you know, we would like to expand our marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| They did an initial contact with TVA, and TVA said that that would be an acceptable use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| But they haven't approved anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| They just said bring us a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| We'll be happy to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| There must be a public hearing involved with that so that the public will have an opportunity to see what this proposal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| and weigh in on that before they would even give any opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| And so the Campbells were told, bring us some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| If you can bring us some property and we might be able to consider an opportunity to maybe do a lease swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| or to do something here so that you're giving us some property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| So they spent weeks, months looking at property in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| They found 20 acres on McPhee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| If you're familiar with McPhee Road, the town of Farragut is also building a park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| The town of Farragut, as I understand, has also bought 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| which they're in negotiation now to maybe build an elementary school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| So you're looking at an area there that could be 60-some acres, which would also serve as recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| So the idea would be that the Campbells went out, found the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| They've got options on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| They're paying monthly option prices on that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| And they've offered that to Knox County for the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| Now, it would have been easier for them to have come in and said, let's expand the marina and not worry about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| But they were told, see if this might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| So this is what they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| We have some folks here that I know would like to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| I'd like to hear from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| And Mr. Ed Neely is here with CBFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5839)|
| 1:37:21| I'd like to hear from the Campbells as well because I'd like for you all to know the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| And I understand that the law director is going to talk about the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| If it's a good deal, let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| If it's not a good deal, let's don't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| But as Mr. Neely has come forward, I will tell you that this property would be used for recreational facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5854)|
| 1:37:41| Finding 20 acres of land in West Knox County is almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| It is not 65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| I believe Mr. Pinkston used that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| Sixty-five thousand an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| Yes, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| It's about 60 to 70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| They bought property adjacent to it or sold it for 70,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| So we're looking at about 1.2 million, up to 1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| But when you look at the recreational opportunities there, CBFO is the largest recreational program in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| And as they've told me, we have all these kids to play and no facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Or they have facilities but not near enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| And I know Mr. Neely is going to give us some figures here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| but there are nine high schools that participate in CBFO, 14 middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| And this is not all Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| We have some folks from the lower city in Anderson County who come in to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| Girls softball, CBFO football, the soccer program, the baseball program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| It goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| We've got all kinds of children who participate in this recreation program, and we need fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| So with that, if it's all right, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Neely is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| I'd like Mr. Neely to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| Like he said, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| My address is 1015 Lovell View Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| I live right beside U.S. Sailor, one of your better complexes in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| I want to clarify a few things that he brought up about the numbers of kids and the organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| CBFO on a yearly basis deals with 400, more or less, probably more, girls in softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5951)|
| 1:39:20| We have anywhere from 400 to the highest we've had is 526, year before last, in football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| And the soccer program is not part of CBFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| That is part of the American Youth Soccer Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| And at this time, and I've made it apparent to Mr. Hammond that if we were going to ever work together to get fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| it would be now because I'm in charge of both groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| Groups have a hard time working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| The limits on our practice facilities, we have two girls' softball fields to practice football on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| Other than that, we pay out several thousand dollars per year to Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| We beg churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| We beg anybody that we can get with a blade of grass in their yard to let us practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| The soccer is in the same situation almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| We get two fields at Concord Park, which are adjacent to the marina for Omni County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| We have 800 kids signed up right now playing spring soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| They started practice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| If you question the need, drive out to the four fields on Pellissippi Parkway at Hardin Valley on March the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:38| and see how hard it is to find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Also, we are looking at a destruction of half of our playing fields at Pellissippi because of the Orange Route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| and the exit to Hardin Valley Road from Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| We have been very reluctant at CBFO and particularly AYSO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6054)|
| 1:41:01| to jump into this political ring over fields, property, and just what goes on with all the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:11| But we're in a position where we can't do that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| We turned away more than 50 kids last fall in football alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:22| We had eliminated four teams from the year before, which is over 100 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| To make up for the other 50 or so kids that were the difference in the numbers from the two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| we overloaded teams and made it impossible for coaches to have a positive experience with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:47| We had 35 kids on some teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| We can't play them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| It's impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| We are supporting this project because we are in desperate need of fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| And this is the best opportunity that's approached either group, to my knowledge, in the ten years I've been with CBFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6123)|
| 1:42:12| I'm sure there's a lot of folks that have reasons against it, but we have totaled between the two groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| 1,500 plus soccer players spring and fall and over 800, closer to 900 kids playing softball and football with CBFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6139)|
| 1:42:31| There's nobody here that can say they have more of a reason for those fields than we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| or there's nobody here that can bring you that kind of representation against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| The money situation that Mr. Pinkston has brought up, I'm not very well aware of what's going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| I'm here because we need fields, and this is the only way I see that we're going to get them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| And it's my understanding it's going to be a couple of years in development at the earliest before we can use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6176)|
| 1:43:04| But we have to think that far down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| Anyone that's driven into West Knoxville, there's a development on virtually every vacant piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6187)|
| 1:43:15| Two years from now, I would expect the numbers to be double what they are right now with children wanting to play youth sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:23| They don't care what goes on in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| They don't care what the parents argue about, about who's right and who's wrong about the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| They need a place to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| I thought of a quote earlier, idle minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| What would those 1,500 soccer players and 800 football and softball players be doing if they weren't on a field somewhere playing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:51| Are there any other questions for Mr. Neely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| Thank you, Mr. Neely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Doug, do you believe this is a good deal for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| This is a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| As a parks director, do I love the idea of building a big box in Concord Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| And in a perfect world, if I had all the money in my budget that I could just go out and buy more land in this part of the county for more ball fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| I wouldn't dream of bringing this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| But at a time when we don't have a lot of money to expand a program, this is creative financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| And frankly, Campbell's brought to me a couple other ideas earlier once the Y fell through of other properties, and I said not interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6277)|
| 1:44:45| The map that I gave you all tonight, hopefully you had a chance to look at it because I was waiting on some information in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| This one I was interested in because there's three parcels together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| One already exists that the town of Farragut owns from McPhee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| The other one you may have read they're negotiating right now to look at the idea of a future elementary school in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:06| that the town of Farragut may buy this and work with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| They're still in that negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| It's not for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| But the property we're looking at is adjacent to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| So when you put all three of these together, it's 63 acres and a joint project between Knox County, the school system and town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| So it's a creative way to expand the system and get more ball fields and take some of the pressure off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| Because as Mr. Neely said, there is a tremendous pressure for ball fields out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| And Concord Park is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| It's 500 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| But only, gosh, less than 100 of that is really available for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| And after that, we start looking at taking out ridges, which I've had two proposals for, for ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| Now, frankly, I don't think I would ever want to do that either, especially with all the pressure on ridgetop development now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| I wouldn't dream of proposing clearing off those ridges for ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| But, obviously, that does nothing to alleviate the pressure of the situation as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| So do I love the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Frankly, I look at it as a bit of a lesser of two evils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| But, you know, it is a creative way to finance, which is, frankly, what we do all the time in parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| To me, the true test will be, if this moves forward, to take it to a public meeting and let the public weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| I've had conversations with TVA about that, and they very much agree that the general public would need to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| But I think, as you can tell from Mr. Neely, there's going to be quite a few folks in favor of this, as well as I know there will be some against it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| As the Director of Parks and Recreation, you're in favor of this moving forward tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| I think I am in terms of the fact that it still has got to go to a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| And the public, in my mind, will have the ultimate say as to whether this is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| And I think that's my job is to try to listen to them as a whole and move forward on what they feel like we ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| Eddie Neely does a yeoman's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| I've worked with him with CBFO Basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| What he says is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| I have the utmost respect for Mr. Neely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| I mean, you have a hard time getting a hold of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| I don't even see how he holds a full-time job with all the work that he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| So I appreciate all that he does for the boys and girls in West Knox County and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| because we do have probably every district here is represented some way by kids going out there to use the facilities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6443)|
| 1:47:34| My concern, though, is that, Mr. Law Director, if we approve this resolution tonight as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6454)|
| 1:47:47| TVA will hold a public hearing and then whatever they determine out of their process, if they approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:56| it does not come back before this commission, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| Or does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Not the way it's written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| You would approve the agreement subject to TVA's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| So instead of having Knox County hold a public hearing, it would be a TVA public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| With Knox County's certainly input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| Well, I'm sure we'd participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| But, see, I just have a problem, and it may be a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| It may be what Knox County wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| But this is Knox County's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| It's the citizens' part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| It's not my part, other than I'm a citizen of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| So my concern is, is that we put it in the hands of TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| and take it out of the hands of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| That's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| The citizens of Knox County may be 100 percent behind this or maybe 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| They just might not be in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| And if that's what they wish, then I think that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| But I think we should find out what the citizens of Knox County wish to do with the part of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:07| My family, my wife's family, where this pool and this property used to sit, was theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:15| It was their property that was condemned by TVA and flooded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| and they didn't have anything to say other than just what dimes on a dollar that TVA gave to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:30| So they were told, when this was condemned and taken from them, that this would always be for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:40| They had problems with the YMCA going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| And I know that at that time they talked about whether or not we should have a dry dock storage there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:53| and they were totally against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| I know it's no longer their property, but, you know, this was their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| This would still be their property if it had not been condemned and taken over by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| So I think that we need to at least have their thoughts in mind when we start dealing with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:18| I would like to add a friendly amendment to the motion that Knox County would hold a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6618)|
| 1:50:28| and that it must come back to this board, this commission, prior to it going to TVA and gaining their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:40| And if the maker of the motion would like to accept that, then I can move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| Otherwise, I'm going to have to vote against it because my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| other than the loss of additional revenues, I'm not sure what Knox County gains from the Campbells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| We're giving them property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| I see that we may gain their option, but what are they actually giving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| We're giving up revenue that we have currently coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| and additional revenue that we would gain by having these additional facilities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| So I'm not sure what we're swapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| Maybe I'm missing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| But I think prior to us giving away valuable county property that can never be replaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| I think we should go to the public first, find out their wishes, and then proceed on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:41| Commissioner, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| In talking with TVA, I have discussed with them that we would, at the same time, conduct a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| That would be my first objective is to conduct that meeting in conjunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| Well, Doug, that's good, but that doesn't give this body a chance to respond back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6712)|
| 1:52:00| I want this body to have a chance to respond back to any public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| Not that whether or not TVA approves it, it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6726)|
| 1:52:12| That's my only problem with this resolution, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:18| is that it takes it out of our hands once it leaves here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| Otherwise, you know, do we need ballparks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| We need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| We need them desperately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Do we have idle minds and idle hands out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| If we don't, yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| And, Doug, you know, maybe we need to, you know, we're talking about over $2 million here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| Well, if we've got $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| then maybe we need to go out there and figure out somewhere else to use $2 million to take care of this need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| But I just think we need to go to the public, find out what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| And if that's what they want, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| But I don't think we need to take it out of our hands yet and just turn it over to TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| Understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| And in talking with TVA tonight, this mayor meant I'd help, but let me pass this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| In discussion with them, I have four concerns that I expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| and I think all but one they would probably agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:20| One was the pending seal property, which is that middle property that Town of Farragut is working on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| I think that's a very important part of this deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| that if those properties aren't all contiguous, to me it's not quite as appealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| So, but hopefully that will shake itself out soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| The second, I passed along to you a letter from TVA about their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| We're projecting a $30,000 cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| You know, it could go higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| And I think that's something we need to deal with, too, the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| how is that paid if it, in fact, does go higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Because we have had very long processes with TVA that could get quite expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| One discussion item I had with them is public sentiment, how do we measure it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| I said, in my mind, it ought to be at least 60% in favor of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| And they agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| So whether we could write that formally into this resolution, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| The last item, and I've asked the law director to look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| and I know he hasn't had a chance because it's probably a tricky one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| but just the fact that TVA is saying we've got to reappraise the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| and pay them $300,000 for the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| I don't quite understand that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| It's Knox County that owns this property, why we're paying TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| So that's a question for the law director to look at at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| But those are my four concerns on the deal as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| What we have to be careful here, it seems to me like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6879)|
| 1:54:43| we're expanding this marina for the Campbells at the taxpayer's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| Now, you've already raised this $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| It may be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| So now we're up to $328,000 that we've got to pay right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| That's just our part, and it could even be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| Plus, also, you have to realize, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| I want you to realize we're going into a tough budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6906)|
| 1:55:11| We're paying $328,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| We've given the seniors a reduction on their taxes and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| It's just tough to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| And I think the reason why TVA, and, of course, I'm no lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| I'm waiting for Mr. Oren to tell us about this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| The reason why they're going at $313,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| because they're increasing that from public recreation to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| And it should be on the taxes like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Now, I don't know whether it's a good deal or a bad deal for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| But in my little business experience I've got, it's a bad deal for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| That's all I can tell you is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| But I'll tell you, we could raise the tax rate two cents and go buy this property the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6951)|
| 1:56:00| And then we have the two cents coming in, a million and a quarter coming in every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| I mean a million and a half coming in every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| that we've got to spend with just a two-cent tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| This is a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6970)|
| 1:56:11| Now, Mr. Neely is up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Nobody wants these kids to be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| Doug, you yourself know we have the same problem in South Knoxville that they have in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6974)|
| 1:56:20| We have it in North Knoxville and East Knoxville that they have with the children playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| But it seems to me like, and I don't want to start class actions and everything here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| but it seems to me like everything we're doing, we're doing in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| We're building the new schools there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| We've got schools in our part of the town that need to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| We've been in classrooms over there, these portable classrooms, for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| Some of them have been 10 years and they're hollering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| But we can't get you or the parks and rec, it seems like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| to do what you've obligated us to do over in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| But here we are going out and giving up tax money and spending more money down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| I can't go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Our county law director is back, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| I've been back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Plus, another thing is, Doug, I want to tell you, we're taking off 20 acres off the tax roll, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| So that's probably, I don't know how much more money that we're losing when we acquire that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Okay, let's go back to 2001 when we approved the lease agreement for the professional management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:27| and operation of Concord Marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| It was proposals were requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| We went through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| And we had the best proposal, and that was submitted by the Campbells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| We went through months of negotiating an agreement that ultimately came before this body in 2001 and was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7062)|
| 1:57:52| The objectives for this lease were that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| and Concord Marina of Knoxville LLC would construct a new marina with facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:06| as described in a number of documents, as well as to maximize the public use of the marina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| as well as the revenue received by the county and the return on Concord Marina of Knoxville LLC's investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7093)|
| 1:58:23| That's where we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| So we had a 25-year agreement with two 10-year options to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:33| So we were looking at 45 years, at the possibility of 45 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| As I look at this, the options to extend were given to the lessee, which is Concord Marina of Knoxville LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:52| But they were subject to the sole discretionary approval of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| which approval may be withheld for any or no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| And so you're looking at a 25-year agreement with no other guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| A 25-year agreement with no other guarantees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| Now, one would presume that if they were operating the marina to our satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| and, you know, Knox County is benefiting from the marina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| and the public is benefiting from the marina, that you would extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| But that's going to occur on or about December the 31st, 2026.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7167)|
| 1:59:37| I don't know how many of you are going to be around, but I will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| The two 10-year options to renew are in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| Under our code, under the Knox County Code, we have a provision that deals with multi-year contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:57| And it would apply to this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| And we are in compliance as of this date because of the way that this contract was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7199)|
| 2:00:07| But let me tell you what that section says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| That's section 2-643, which basically gives the life of a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| and it stops the life of a contract roughly at 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| So this body can approve of a contract of 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| We're in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| What you have before you is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:37| What this agreement seeks to do is to basically exchange a 50-year term for roughly a 45-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7237)|
| 2:00:57| But we've already gone through seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| We're adding on 50 with no options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| Under our code, we cannot approve of a 50-year agreement, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| Ultimately, if you were to approve of the two 10-year options to renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| you would still be tacking on another 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| So we're still way out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:23| And, Mr. Pinkston, the taxes on this property, any real estate taxes are accepted from this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:32| There are no real estate taxes that are paid by the lessee under the terms of this agreement that was approved back in 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7292)|
| 2:01:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| Let me ask you one thing here, too, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| Did I understand you to say that Knox County helped build that marina, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| I think you would have misunderstood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| What we, you know, as part of this process, what we wanted was a first-class marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| And that's what we sought to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| And I think that's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| I live in the area, and I travel through there occasionally, and it's first-rate without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:13| The agreement that we have in place complies with Knox County law as we know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| The new agreement, unfortunately, I have to tell you, would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7339)|
| 2:02:27| It would be my recommendation that we would basically not exactly go back to square one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7347)|
| 2:02:37| because I know a lot of progress has been made in dealing with this new little piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7357)|
| 2:02:46| that they wish to include with the marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| And then you've got your 20 acres or so that, you know, we would certainly like to use for ball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| But if we could just take those two items and we can, under our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| negotiate those items outside of the confines of our agreement as we know it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| if we can do that over the next 30 days, the mayor would have to sign off on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| Hugh Holt would have to sign on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| He's our purchasing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| John Troyer, the finance director, would have to sign off on that, and it would come through me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| It's to bring back, and that's provided that the Campbells are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| I know it costs them money every second of the day for a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| But under another section of our code, we can enter into non-competitive negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:47| And if you wish to do that, we can bring back to this body an agreement next month through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| Basically, Hugh Holt, the purchasing director, has to do a market analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| You know, this is a unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| But we can accomplish that through our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| and bring back to this body something next month that you can vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| Based on this new information, I have a substitute motion that we withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:24| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:27| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| I think we still have some more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| Commissioner Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Yeah, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| I was just looking at one of the potential risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| and under the limit use of the parkland to one user group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| I'm trying to read your map right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| Is this where the proposed storage building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| I know there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| Is that pool in use right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| We closed that a few years ago, and it's just building right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| And then the access, I think there's some bike trails out back behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| Would this cut off any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| There may be some rerouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| I frankly would hope we could adjust the parking to where we don't affect those trails any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| I guess the basic question I have is that the Campbells have gone to a lot of time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| This is something that hasn't come across just in the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| They've been working on this for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| and they've been talking with folks here in Knox County about the process and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| They're the ones who are out the money, and they have spent quite a bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| and money on this, and you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| Do you want to do this, or do you just want to walk away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| I mean, if you want to wait 30 days, it looks like that's the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| But if you guys are saying, hey, we've had enough, and you want to walk away, I understand that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| I guess I need a little clarification on what you're going to be voting on to know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:54| Our best case scenario is to separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| If you all want this property, the 20 acres, then fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| We'll let you walk into our shoes and buy it for exactly what we're paying for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:05| not a penny more, not a penny less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| If that's a good deal, then I would let you determine that on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| What we really are wanting to do is the same thing we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| We just want to be able to expand it to an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:20| Well, answering Mr. Pinkston's question about whether it's a good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| I think this body a couple of years ago approved a YMCA for maybe a dollar income to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| What we would pay for that same piece of property would be approximately $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| So, and it doesn't cost the county any more than it would there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| So I'm not sure how you determine a good deal or a bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| But, really, you almost need to look at them separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Do you want this property is property that TVA has said basically has a very restricted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7611)|
| 2:06:58| And, yes, lake property is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7618)|
| 2:07:00| But only if you can build a fancy house on it or condos or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| This property has basically little or no monetary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| As public recreation, it's useful mainly for picnic tables and passive use such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:18| And there's a document here floating around that will tell you exactly what you can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Commercial recreation takes it just a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| And it's created by TVA to make proper use of the marine activities that would go along with the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7647)|
| 2:07:35| And they mention specifically marinas, cabins, restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| and things that would use and make an efficient use of that property on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7661)|
| 2:07:49| And that's really all that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| That's all they'll let you do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| So what's it worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| We're willing to pay exactly what we've been paying for all the rest of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| and what this body thought five years ago was a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7680)|
| 2:08:04| I will say it's about 21 times what you were getting before we took it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| And it grows every year at a very fast pace compared to what you all had six years ago in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7689)|
| 2:08:18| You have probably 100-fold more usage as far as the citizens down there that drive in it, that spend time down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:27| I think it accomplished every goal that this body had five or six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| and I haven't heard any negative response from anybody about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| But I don't know, Commissioner Hammond, what you're asking me to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| Preferably, we would just separate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| I don't think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| But on the other hand, we can't continue to pay the seller for a maybe situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:57| I'll be glad to let you have the property and you can pay on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:01| and we can go to as many public meetings as you'd like, take years to do it if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| as long as it's on your dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| But I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| I mean, it's too expensive for me to hold that property in case the county may decide they want to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| My sense is that that's what you're talking about is you're talking about a maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| I mean, there's no guarantee that you'll sit down and negotiate anything in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| I mean, we've already been doing this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| We've gone through four meetings and we're no closer now than where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| So that's why I'm saying it's entirely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| If you all want to go through the negotiation process, but my sense is there are no guarantees here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| But it's basically you're in Darby's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| Well, are you saying that we would negotiate something over the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| and then we would have an up or down vote in 30 days, in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:48| I mean, if we had an up or down, we might gamble another 30 days at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| I can't read the tea leaves here, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I guess what we're asking is it sounded like John Owen said that this body could recommend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| What exactly did you say that this body could vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| Well, they can't vote on what's performed tonight and be in compliance with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:13| What they can do basically, they could defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| They could withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Either way, you could bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| A commissioner could bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| And during the next 30 days or so, go through this noncompetitive negotiation with Hugh Holt and the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:38| and try to come to some agreement that will comply with all of our rules and regs and our code and charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:48| Mr. Law Director, I'd like to change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| I want to be just a little creative here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| I'd like to change my motion to a withdrawal with a nonbinding something of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7856)|
| 2:11:05| basically where if we vote yes on this, that we withdraw it to give them time to go back and renegotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:15| But by voting yes, we're sending a nonbinding signal to these folks that we are in favor of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:22| and if something favorable comes back to us that we can vote on legally, that we intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| That way, with that vote, it will show these guys what our intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| Even though we can't actually vote for this this month because of the problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| it would show these guys what our intent is so as they go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| I think that would be acceptable to Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7908)|
| 2:11:50| I think what we're really looking for is it has been four meetings now, and it has kind of kept on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| And then this is a new thing that cropped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| And we are paying $10,000 a month for this option, plus other expenses to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7917)|
| 2:12:03| that if we could get some signal from this body that, yes, they think it's a good deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| it's worth trying to negotiate on behalf of us and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| and see if we can come back with something that they could approve, that would, you know, be otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| I mean, if we're just going to continue down the road of indecision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| and maybe one day go to a public meeting, then I'd have to say we'd probably be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| You know, I mean, that's nothing to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| But if we had a little bit of something to go on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| I think Ed and I are willing to take a flyer on it and continue down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Is Hugh Holt here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| He's sick today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| Mr. Pinkston, are you okay with that added thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| Mr. Pinkston, are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| You second Mr. Lampert's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| No, I'm not okay with the intent, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:54| I would like to ask Mr. Campbell something else, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7974)|
| 2:12:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Mr. Campbell, I really feel like that you're not giving us anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| because you're taking our money, our rent money that we collect from you, to buy this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:09| We're putting up $328,000 for you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| Now, let me ask you this, would you be willing to pay the $328,000 or half of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| and would you be willing to put this new property on the tax rolls for what it's appraised as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| and pay taxes on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8008)|
| 2:13:29| I mean, what I would say we would do with the additional property in Concord is lease it just like we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8009)|
| 2:13:37| It's a fee-based, it's a percentage-based deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| And the more we can rent it out for, the more the county makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| That's been projected by Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| And it makes enough money, ostensibly, for you all to buy the 20 acres at no cost to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8029)|
| 2:13:59| I know you keep saying it comes from the taxpayers, but if it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| it's only because he's missed his calculations by a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| But generally, what we're going to pay is additional revenue to what we're paying right now for the additional six acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8045)|
| 2:14:15| That's property you're not getting a dime for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| You're going to pick up, you know, well over the course of about 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| I think he figures that you will pay off the 20 acres and you'll keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| and you'll still be collecting money from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| And it will be a lot more in 20 years than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| So from a real estate perspective, I think it's a pretty good deal, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| But I don't really care if you do it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| Fifteen years from now, we'll be collecting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| But right now, we won't be collecting a penny because the $106,000, say, that you're giving us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| I mean $109,000 you're paying in 2008, that will not go into our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:52| That will go towards the purchase of the 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| No, sir, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| I think what we're paying you now stays what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8096)|
| 2:15:00| There may be some shortfall in the first couple of years because there's going to be a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:04| before we actually get the docks going and creating money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| And that's in your projection, too, from what I saw that Doug created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:13| But the $109,000 is what we're paying now, and that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:19| We're at $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| At $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| But does that $109,000 not go, that's what I'm saying, towards purchase of this 20 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| That's the way I asked Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8130)|
| 2:15:31| That's the way I understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| The way we've set it up right now, yes, sir, because we can pay the entire amount off in about 15 or 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8132)|
| 2:15:39| So the $109,000 is not going into our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| It's going towards purchasing the property that they say they're buying for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| Yes, sir, because the original proposal, if you recall, actually had them buying the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| and then us paying them back for it, which we can borrow money a lot cheaper than they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| And so, frankly, it made no sense to me in a business sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| Well, you know, if you're taking my, I'm a taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| and I look at if you're taking $109,000 that would be going into our general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| buying property that somebody's giving me, I can't figure that out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| It is a short-term loss and a long-term gain, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| I've had two citizens that have had their hands up for the last hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:23| Yeah, with the stripy shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| He's a citizen first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:30| Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| With all the high finance and the land swapping deal and everything else going here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:40| as a voter, as a citizen of West Knox County for 31 years, I'm kind of a real advocate for saving the shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8200)|
| 2:16:51| I know that sounds like tree-hugging and all, but we used to vote on Teleco Lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| when you could actually walk up, see trees and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| Knox County, when you go along the Tennessee River up through, all you see are houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8220)|
| 2:17:06| And as Mr. Leuthold says, when you give that property up to put another dry storage facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:16| and put more docks in, you've lost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| The people have lost access to the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| I don't know how many of you are boaters, but as you go down the lake, you can't pull into a cove anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:27| You're sitting in somebody's front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| There is no shoreline left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| And I was a big proponent and sent a lot of emails to TVA when they finally opened it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| and wanted citizen input to the problem of giving away public land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:44| So I would just like to go on record, and I hope that there are some other folks that support me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| I think there may be a few here this evening that would like to have something prior to TVA's review of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:56| citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| I would like to see citizens of Knox County have input as to what they want to happen to this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| I have a striped shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| I'm just going to let two, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Cecil Presnell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| I was kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| I'm Cecil Presnell, 1242 Eagle Nest Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| and I appreciate the opportunity to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| I think Commissioner Leuthold made a very good point about public input into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8304)|
| 2:18:29| because I remember this process about two or three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| We got public input on a dry dock, and if I'm not mistaken, it was almost unanimous public disapproval of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:40| So I say I agree, first of all, that we should get that public input before we take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8320)|
| 2:18:45| Commissioner Pinkston makes a very good point, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| We need to make sure that this is an open process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:50| and that we really are determining the value for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| There may be a lot of people interested in that property at that kind of price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| and we need to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| I am absolutely in favor of youth sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| and I recognize that we have much need for more property for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| and I'm involved in First T, which is youth sports, and we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| But that doesn't say that this is the only way to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| And I think there must be other ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| So thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| Commissioner Moulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| I think you were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| I just want to confirm one thing so that there's no misunderstanding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| I'm here for sports fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Up until a couple of weeks ago, I didn't know Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| But this is the only deal that has come up in my 10 years with CBFO that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:43| The money part that Mr. Pinkston talks about, he may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:48| I've been drug into this just a little bit in the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| and I'm kind of in the black on the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| I don't know what's going on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| I'll tell you right up front, that's your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| You protect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| I'm a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:00| I don't own a boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| I hardly ever go in the water anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| But the two groups I represent need those fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| And Mr. Pinkston's right also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| His groups in South Knoxville need them just as bad as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| Our ref out there and their fields are in as bad a shape as anybody in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:21| I just don't want any misunderstanding of why I came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| Those 2,500-plus kids I represent are my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| If this is financially viable, it is a no-lose situation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| Doug mentioned two groups that he's been approached about developing county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:46| We're one of those groups at CBFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| We did the architecture work, have a site plan, and the estimate is $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:56| There is no way under the sun that a youth group of total volunteers can raise any kind of money near that to do that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8456)|
| 2:21:04| We've been to his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| It's just not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| We've wasted several thousand dollars drawing up the plans, but I've taken a little look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| and we could take that plan and stick it right on that property for less than half that money probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| It's all because of all the earth-moving and shoreline stuff that we would have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:29| over by North Shore at our current fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| Craig and I haven't always agreed on things on the court, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| but I have the utmost respect for him also and the gentleman that respects the shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:46| I've been in the timber business my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I've recently quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| And there is no one here that loves a tree more than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| And I like to see them standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| So you've got a tough decision, and I don't envy any of you having to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| But somewhere in the next four to five years, you better be prepared for the number of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:09| that you're going to have to deal with in these rate programs, both in Mr. Pinkston's area and, you know, Sam's groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:17| They need them bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:18| We need them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| But right now is the only opportunity we have to get them where we are in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:27| Can I say something real quick to Mr. Neely here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| Eddie, in no way did I think that you didn't have anything but the most utmost reasons for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:38| and just looking out for the kids of the community and trying to find ballparks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:43| And I commend you for being involved the way you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| I said earlier I've stayed away from this political ring for a reason, but now it's time to get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:53| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Doug, to get to dry storage, do we need to land swap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| or can we just take the dry storage and forget the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| If we voted to ask TVA to give us permission to build the dry storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:13| I'm not too sure I'm following the question, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| The Campbells want to build a dry storage on that land they've got leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:20| Can we just vote that up or down and forget the land if people think the land is a bad deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:28| If we think the dry storage for the citizens who do boat, saving the shoreline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| and putting those boats all in a building, it's away from the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| It's where a pool was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| Nothing is there now except, I guess, where some of the pool used to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:47| You absolutely could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| My thought is that the carrot in this deal is getting more ball fields for the kids in that part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| I think if you went to a public meeting and just had a dry storage unit with no carrot attached to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| I don't think it would work, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| The hour is getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| It's 835.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8652)|
| 2:24:13| I'm going to ask that we just go ahead and withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| I don't think we're going to be able to resolve anything here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:19| Let them get together with the law director, see what they can work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| see if they can come up with a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| If they can, bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| If you can't, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| But I guess I would go along with Commissioner Lambert's thing that we withdraw it without an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| Let's just withdraw it, take it off the agenda, and let them see what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| Well, I'll tell you what I'm thinking with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| It's not binding, and if my motion fails to withdraw with a statement of intent, what that does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8678)|
| 2:24:47| if my motion passes, these guys know that there's a lot of support for this project on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| And so then they can make the decision based on whether they want to continue to pay on this option based on that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| If that vote fails, then we can have another simple vote to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| and then what these guys have another piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| They know that there's not enough support, and they may not want to continue to pay on that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:15| And that's what I'm looking out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| I just hate for these guys to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| You know, I want them to know whether they're throwing good money after bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8720)|
| 2:25:23| or whether they're continuing to make an investment that may manifest itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:28| So I'm going to ask if someone will second my withdrawal with a statement of intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:36| Well, you already have a substitute motion with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| Oh, I did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| I mean, with all due respect, I'd like for mine to stand just so these guys can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| Yeah, I was going to second his motion because I like the idea that it brings all the groups to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| and then these guys know what they've got to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| And I can say, Mr. Kemp, you know, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| If it doesn't, let's pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| But I want to send a message to these gentlemen too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| Commissioner Luther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| I guess I'm not sure what the intent is, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| Could you explain the intent part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| The intent is what we're saying by voting yes for this is that we're going to withdraw this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| but we're in favor of how should I say this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:37| Yeah, yeah, we're in favor of the continued negotiation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| and we're in favor of the spirit of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| Even though we're not allowed to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| we are in favor with the spirit of this motion to put this deal together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| And it's not binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:53| If something totally changes next month, you know, we're not committing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| What we're basically saying is that if they put something together that's legal and that works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8818)|
| 2:27:05| that our intention is to make this deal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:08| Well, I guess on my part, I'd have to know what was negotiated before I could give you an up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| And that's, I guess, my problem with the intent, because I don't want to send them a mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| Well, and I plan on voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| I plan on voting yes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| But my intent is not to vote on anything that comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| My intent is if they negotiate in good faith with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| and put something together that's mutually beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| my intent is to support this project, providing they put something good together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8856)|
| 2:27:42| Well, I guess we all will have in our own minds what's a good deal or a bad deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| or what we can support or not in another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| I mean, I can go along with it, because I would like to see something come forward that could be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8873)|
| 2:28:01| I don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| And quite frankly, I don't know what, Mr. Campbell, I mean, is this something that you're in favor of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| sort of a withdrawal with an intent or just a simple withdrawal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| just knowing that we would like to continue to negotiate with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8893)|
| 2:28:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8900)|
| 2:28:21| Frankly, it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| When I wake up in the morning, I'm not sure whether I'll proceed on or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| But if I don't have some encouragement, then I know I probably will not proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| As to you, personally, I think that I'm not sure there's ever going to be enough that's going to persuade you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:41| I think your family involvement with this property is very significant to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I'd feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| You know, I feel like I probably am not going to be able to do anything to get your vote anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| But I would like to get maybe a straw poll of how many people here think that given it's a rational deal for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8938)|
| 2:29:08| and we can talk numbers all night long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| and everybody's eyes will roll up in their head and we'll not know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| But assuming that Mr. Owings and Hugh Holt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8954)|
| 2:29:18| and the various ones that can delve into the details decide it's a good deal for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| are you all interested in doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| I don't want to sell you a bill of goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| I don't even really want to be involved in this 20 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| other than the fact that it's the only way I can get your attention, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| And I may ask that you recuse yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| Well, quite frankly, I don't have a personal interest because it's not owned by my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8977)|
| 2:29:42| at least not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8982)|
| 2:29:44| That happened, what, 50-plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| So I don't have a direct interest in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| I'm going to recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| It doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:54| I could be convinced to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8994)|
| 2:29:57| I was ready to vote for this if we would allow this to go to a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| and then come back to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:04| I've stated that for the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| I just don't think we should take it out of our hands yet and simply put it in TVA's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:14| But I also think that we should take a look and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:17| You said you might be willing to allow us to take over your option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:22| And if that's something that we could, you would be willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:28| I think that's something that this body ought to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| and maybe compensate you for the money that you have already spent on the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| so that you're not out any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| I don't believe you should be out one cent, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| You all have done an excellent job with that marina out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| It is the best marina I've ever been to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| So I appreciate the job that you've done out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:56| I just think we should, before we give up park land, we should hear from the people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9056)|
| 2:31:01| And that's all that I've ever asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:06| But I think if we can maybe buy out your option so that you're not out anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| and we have a fair deal and this commission and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| and everybody thinks that we ought to make the deal where we just purchase that land ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:21| and maybe we can pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| And I think that's maybe something we could do over the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| That's a good option and I appreciate your bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:33| Our intent is not to make any money on this property and nor lose any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:39| And we're sitting here kind of between losing it and maybe going even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| So if you take it over, then we're not opposed to public meetings or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:48| Our only problem is the time frame that we've got now, as you know, with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| Well, and if we were to take it over, I wouldn't want to be paying out however much it is to keep the option going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:58| I think we want to act on it quickly and then start paying money on the property, not just on an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9118)|
| 2:32:08| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| Commissioner Bowne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| I just want to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| I'm prepared to vote for the motion that's on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:17| knowing that I have another vote to make the final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| Motion on the floor from Commissioner Lampert is to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| I'm binding intent and to renegotiate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| That's the motion on the floor that was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9164)|
| 2:32:46| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| There's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:49| Two no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:50| There's somebody down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| All the noes, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| There's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| Kingston, DeFries, and do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:06| No, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| We're ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt1?start=9193)|
