| 2:45:31| proposals on access so you're not paving the entire site and that is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| through the ordinance to a nice County Department of Public Works to approve an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| alternative parking plan we've referenced their application which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9941)|
| 2:45:49| outlines how this will operate hours of operation it identifies lighting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| that they will have full cutoff or shielded down lighting on the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| lot which is closest to the property to the north so those kind of things have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9960)|
| 2:46:05| been addressed there's not a foot candle site lighting requirement but it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9965)|
| 2:46:10| requirement and and not County ordinance that you're not supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9970)|
| 2:46:15| direct lighting to adjoining properties so the staff's position that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| addressed these issues and I think they by how they market the thing they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| direct people how to come to the site and deal with some of these concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| this is scaled back a bit from what they originally had because the previous plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| in addition to having the tent location they had a more permanent pavilion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=9994)|
| 2:46:40| was proposed and they've taken out at this this stage and coming in with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10000)|
| 2:46:47| to do a little smaller scale event facility here and I guess you know any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10007)|
| 2:46:52| change from what's in this proposal would have to come back before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| Planning Commission for reconsideration thank you miss King did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10016)|
| 2:47:02| something really short yes and thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| mr. Bracco you made some great points there one of the things with the lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| mrs. blue who owns a property so the other side of the road if in fact lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| looking at what she submitted she said submitted all copies to you all it shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10034)|
| 2:47:19| that property might have to be tweaked or adjusted more because of her owning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| that property across the street which therefore it goes back to Corinne's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10044)|
| 2:47:29| Ravetti's property of the one that signed the release this has been a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| long year and a half for all of us one thing I love that you're doing now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10053)|
| 2:47:37| that you're doing field trips there has not been communication and there has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10057)|
| 2:47:43| been a very bad exchange I'm asking this group we'd love to talk with them miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10063)|
| 2:47:48| King we're looking for facts on the case and we do have a motion on the table we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| have a second I will I didn't know whether you had some other relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| facts it's just that she owns a property that was showing anything it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| there's not three of it buffer thank you three of it and 200 for shows for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10084)|
| 2:48:09| 28 acres mr. Buston Commissioner Smith I was just asking since this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10089)|
| 2:48:17| includes four or five different parcels that it's if one of these parcels was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10097)|
| 2:48:24| broken off and sold does it affect the approval for the main parcel that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| buildings and stuff are on I think that's a mr. Briscoe question the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10111)|
| 2:48:37| thing that may impact is the number of overnight accommodations by the 41 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10117)|
| 2:48:44| that they have as a part of this proposal I think they can do up to 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| overnight accommodations they're proposing nine with this and so it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10129)|
| 2:48:57| reduce the number that they could actually have out there in combinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| as far as what they take out of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10141)|
| 2:49:06| madam chair I'd ask call for the question please we have a motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10146)|
| 2:49:12| table by Commissioner graph to postpone for 30 days second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| Buston all in favor aye opposed no can we do a roll call please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10157)|
| 2:49:28| Commissioner Buston mr. Clancy no mr. Crowder yes mr. Eason no mr. graph yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10168)|
| 2:49:40| mr. Hill no mr. Ooten no mr. Phillips no mr. Roth no mr. Smith yes mr. Toker no I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10180)|
| 2:49:59| can make a motion to approve the development plan for the rural retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| with an event facility second subject to the eight conditions we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| by Commissioner Clancy a second by Commissioner Hill to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| development plan subject to eight conditions madam chair could we add one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10214)|
| 2:50:21| more condition to that please can we would you like to make it a making a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10221)|
| 2:50:26| recommendation yeah lighting be dark sky compliant I'm sorry would you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10226)|
| 2:50:34| dark sky compliant also that it's only during events in the parking only doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10234)|
| 2:50:46| during events I will amend my motion to include commissioners before before a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10246)|
| 2:51:02| second I just like to ask the question does that simply mean down lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10262)|
| 2:51:06| down lighting and pretty much in there certain other parameters for dark sky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| but it's pretty it's very common now it doesn't bleed over into neighboring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| properties second can I ask a question about the compliance with conditions is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10276)|
| 2:51:25| for example if mr. Betty sees that there are some lights on when there is not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| event going on what is her recourse does she call the sheriff does she call code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10291)|
| 2:51:38| administration of the city I would I encourage the owners operators to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10298)|
| 2:51:45| provide numbers to call because and then given my sense of humor my length of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10305)|
| 2:51:54| tenure also give mr. Betty a nice pellet gun in that so so yes if it's if it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10314)|
| 2:52:01| codes compliance and codes compliance is probably not going to answer the phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10321)|
| 2:52:05| at 11 o'clock at night and you know and that that's true but then they they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10325)|
| 2:52:11| would take action against the the operators of the event and I'm sure mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10331)|
| 2:52:17| Elliott would come out there and reprimand them severely is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10337)|
| 2:52:22| mr. hill your light still on mr. crowd Commissioner Crowder thank you madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10342)|
| 2:52:35| chair I don't want to stir the pot but I'd be a mess but not mentioning that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| happen to run across a written document last night from the state and I'm glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| to hear you say that you're willing to follow all rules and regulations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| permitting but we know the history of this development and there were lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| rules and regulations that were never followed I think a 30-day extension is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10376)|
| 2:53:02| not too much to ask for even though we've voted that down and I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| you continue to follow rules and regulations everyone else in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10387)|
| 2:53:11| community in this community has to we're builders and developers also we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| follow those rules and to see someone blatantly disregard state permitting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| is beside me I just I'd be a mess if I didn't bring that up I hope you follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10403)|
| 2:53:32| every rule and regulation from here on out and you can satisfy the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| to their requests because they certainly deserve it thank you Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10416)|
| 2:53:42| Crowder we do have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10422)|
| 2:53:48| Commissioner Hill to prove the development plan subject to nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| conditions Commissioner Weston that's right there was nothing said about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| buffering and that's not in any of the conditions the landscape buffering you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10439)|
| 2:54:12| might ask Commissioner Clancy to amend his motion I think that the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10452)|
| 2:54:21| plan and it's already addressed in the development plan I think adequately can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10461)|
| 2:54:32| you show me where it's addressed mr. Bretschko that may be something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10472)|
| 2:54:38| also mr. I think it in the covenants with the adjacent property owner the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10478)|
| 2:54:45| buffers written into the document that was signed for the encroachment thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10485)|
| 2:54:52| you all right can I can the residents verify that statement please yes yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10492)|
| 2:55:04| can you verify that please so in the agreement that I've signed for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10504)|
| 2:55:11| reduced setback it does indicate that buffering will occur okay it doesn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10511)|
| 2:55:17| in what capacity I think we may have agreement here but it would be lovely to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10517)|
| 2:55:21| codify the head to say that it would be Gerald what were you saying according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10521)|
| 2:55:28| city versus County that that's an even better buffer zone or whatever would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| give me adequate buffering is the my main point foot buffer is described in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10533)|
| 2:55:39| the city zoning code would you be willing to put that in your motion no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10539)|
| 2:55:46| ma'am all right Commissioner Hill yes thank you would the applicant be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10546)|
| 2:55:55| willing to abide by that we are yeah so we would put the landscape buffer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10555)|
| 2:56:01| so that should be part of the motion 20 20 because we cannot minimum 25 okay we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10561)|
| 2:56:10| are we good with the applicant has agreed to this it is in the contract we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10570)|
| 2:56:20| have a motion on the floor and we have a second madam chair County can't enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| private contract between those parties so it's like it's not existing in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| of our okay so the option if you want this condition added is to deny the or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10591)|

| 3:00:04| off the alley we mentioned that that is not the has not been the current or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10804)|

| 3:00:21| infill housing guidelines requested that that standard be reenacted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10821)|
| 3:00:26| applicant received approval minute 2008 for for this development showing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10826)|
| 3:00:37| driveway off the off the street the reason for that is we've determined was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10837)|
| 3:00:43| that the alley was then improved in 2007 it was paved in 2009 therefore became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10843)|
| 3:00:50| usable and accessible for driveways and I'll defer to Miss Portier now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10850)|
| 3:00:55| additional information so for those of you who may not be familiar with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10855)|
| 3:00:59| infill housing design review committee it's sort of a lighter version of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10859)|
| 3:01:03| historic zoning Commission so the rules and regulations that are associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| the infill housing overlay zone are not as detailed or stringent as you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10867)|
| 3:01:12| find in the historic overlay however both boards have similar goals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10872)|
| 3:01:16| they are concerned with the aesthetic qualities of these older neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10876)|
| 3:01:20| that have some historic homes within those neighborhoods as Gerald said the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10880)|
| 3:01:25| regulations and one of the regulations and the infill housing guidelines state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| that there's a functioning alley abutting the property that it's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10889)|
| 3:01:33| provide the access this might seem arbitrary but if you think about older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| homes they have much more narrow lot widths the housing stock is smaller so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| the houses are closer together so all street parking is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10901)|
| 3:01:45| curb cuts driveways and parking are preferred to be at the rear of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10905)|
| 3:01:49| to protect street views from the visual clutter there are some properties with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10909)|
| 3:01:53| access off the street on Connecticut Avenue however these predate the infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10913)|
| 3:01:57| housing guidelines they were adopted in 2005 and actually these properties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| one of the reasons that this guideline is in place to mitigate that condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10922)|
| 3:02:06| as Gerald said the infill housing design review committee approved this his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10926)|
| 3:02:12| application for a new building and site plan in February and one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10932)|
| 3:02:17| conditions is what he's appealing which is the alley access a couple of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10937)|
| 3:02:22| with the original approval mr. Fairchild had to submit a new set of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10942)|
| 3:02:27| plans because the old set of building plans no longer met building code so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| committee's original approval couldn't stand at that point also regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10952)|
| 3:02:36| Tennessee state law I know we kind of touched on it earlier in the meeting but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| state log is development plans three years a three-year vesting period and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10959)|
| 3:02:44| there are things developers can can do to extend that period but state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| specifies that in no case shall it extend past ten years and the city's law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10968)|
| 3:02:54| department weighed in on that and that was their finding so for these reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| or actually the committee's authority to attach conditions to their approvals is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10979)|
| 3:03:02| granted in the city's zoning ordinance and their conditions are based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10982)|
| 3:03:07| guidelines associated with the infill housing overlay zone and so for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10987)|
| 3:03:11| reasons staffs recommending denial of the appeal to uphold the infill housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| design review committee's decision I'm happy to answer any questions and of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| course the applicant is present and applicant would you like to is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11000)|
| 3:03:27| opposition my name is Monty Fairchild my address is 6815 Washington Park I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11007)|
| 3:03:34| here for the committee some papers one of them is the prior approval that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11014)|
| 3:03:39| had in 08 to have the access in the front that it was stating that the alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11019)|
| 3:03:47| is unusable as access to the property it all it also I think this would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11027)|
| 3:03:53| good I think this is more of a city ordinance than a state ordinance on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11033)|
| 3:03:58| vesting period that is talking about but if somebody would hand these out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| committee I've got these right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11042)|
| 3:04:05| Thank You mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11045)|
| 3:04:32| I also have these papers right here which is showing a little small diagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11072)|
| 3:04:45| and a color chart of the accesses on Connecticut Avenue with the driveways in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11085)|
| 3:04:51| the front and the some of them that don't have that during that time was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11091)|
| 3:04:56| unaccessible because of the terrain anyway that's the reason that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11096)|
| 3:05:00| not more driveways on the front of Connecticut Avenue it also shows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11100)|
| 3:05:03| ones that do have driveways in the back some of them are just dirt and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| them do coincide with what they're what they're asking for but if you'd pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| these out to that I have these that's showing all that information right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| Thank You mr. Briscoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11116)|
| 3:05:30| oh thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11130)|
| 3:05:50| when I met the guidelines in 2008 and it was approved for the alley to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11150)|
| 3:05:56| accessible point and have the driveway on the front and then if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| chart there all the colors in blue have the driveways on the front going in off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11161)|
| 3:06:05| Connecticut Avenue all except for my property which is highlighted right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11165)|
| 3:06:08| there and and because of the terrain the way the terrain goes down was the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| that it was unaccessible from the alley my guidelines then are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11173)|
| 3:06:17| guidelines that was in place now the guidelines have not changed from 2008 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11177)|
| 3:06:22| present the alley has not been upgraded from 2008 to present so I would think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11182)|
| 3:06:28| that this would be able to stand and go forward for the reasonable use of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11188)|
| 3:06:32| property to put the driveway in the front and be be done with this and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11192)|
| 3:06:37| able to access my property from that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11197)|
| 3:06:44| thank you as I noted the I'd like to get the confirmation from city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11204)|
| 3:06:50| that the alley was paved in 2009 is that correct I can't speak on the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11210)|
| 3:06:56| that it was paved I'm not certain didn't didn't do that research and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11216)|
| 3:07:00| but it is a paved alley now appears to be in really good shape and I'm sorry to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11220)|
| 3:07:07| put you on the spot but we do have an email from Tom Clabo I think was shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11227)|
| 3:07:11| with the Commission that it was paved in 2009 also have some pictures right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| this shows you can only see from the plot plan of a aerial view but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11236)|
| 3:07:21| shows the terrain of the from the front view and a terrain from the back view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11241)|
| 3:07:26| that shows the way that slope so bad you got to do the swale in the back of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11246)|
| 3:07:34| property anyway so water runoff and stuff if you hand these out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11254)|
| 3:07:46| it just shows a little bit more of the terrain because I'm gonna satellite view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11266)|
| 3:08:00| you can't hardly see the slope of the terrain and the way it goes from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11280)|
| 3:08:03| back use that's how come it was deemed unusable access because of the severe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11283)|
| 3:08:09| slope going down from the backyard and I was just asking that it be originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11289)|
| 3:08:27| as in 2008 that would be able to do the driveway from the Canadian thank you sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11307)|
| 3:08:35| did you have anything else you absolutely can't support of what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11315)|

| 3:08:47| contractor Knoxville's last two years I finished 13 houses smaller houses I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| like to be advocate for money on a couple issues I don't know if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| pertains to the board but I'll say my piece anyway several years ago the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11336)|
| 3:09:01| asked us to build smaller and more inexpensive homes that lower-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11341)|
| 3:09:06| people can use them this is exactly the neighborhood that Knoxville was looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11346)|
| 3:09:10| for since then Knoxville has increased the price of a little home $8,000 by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| changing new codes we've made them better safer more insulated certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11354)|
| 3:09:20| more efficient however you cost $8,000 more this is a couple thousand dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11360)|
| 3:09:25| difference between being able to park on the front in the front of the house the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11365)|
| 3:09:29| way every other house that's on there does and you can look at the map see all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11369)|
| 3:09:32| the cars in the front yard versus going to the backyard and money I do have me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11372)|

| 3:09:49| right thing on his houses they're nice they're low-income he sells them or he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11389)|
| 3:09:53| rents them and I think once you guys approve or disapprove this nobody's ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11393)|
| 3:09:59| going to go out there and care one way or the other whether one house in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| middle of 20 other houses has a car parked in their front yard on the on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| driveway like everything else does but it's a big deal to us and it certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| hurts our wallet I mean we're trying to do what what you know everybody in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| room would like to see which is more affordable housing and it might not seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11414)|
| 3:10:19| like a big deal but it's a big deal to turn around and tell somebody to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| four times the amount of property to have a driveway in the backyard not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| that low-income houses often have people who are handicapped and you park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11427)|
| 3:10:31| back there and you don't go all the way up to the house then you're walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| uphill after you park your car and who wants to do that so I know this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| unique situation I understand that you want to support the city and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11438)|
| 3:10:41| arguments but you have the ability to just let them build the house like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| everything else on that street and agree to it and one other thing I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| say if I bought that lot which we had talked about at one time to build a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| house I would have assumed that that his permission to put the driveway in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11452)|
| 3:10:58| the front yard would convey with the property just like if I buy a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| property and someone's already run through the health department for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| septic tank that it would go with the property to it doesn't go with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| individual and I'm kind of shocked that the state is saying or any anybody is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11469)|
| 3:11:12| saying that that yeah we approve there but you didn't do it in time so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11472)|
| 3:11:16| therefore you need to do it all over again and we're not gonna judge you by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11476)|
| 3:11:19| the same criteria I doubt this is going to come in front of you again it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| it's a unique rare thing but let the guy build the house and let's just get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11486)|
| 3:11:31| on we've delayed it three months already thanks mr. Kearns thank you and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11491)|
| 3:11:35| have Commissioner lights on but before we go to Commission that's like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11495)|
| 3:11:38| from me one other thing I'd like to state that the original house that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| there the driveway was in the front you can't see it now because the grass has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11502)|
| 3:11:46| grown back over and everything but when the original house was there before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11506)|

| 3:11:53| mr. Green yes I just a couple of things one driveway does not have to be paved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11513)|
| 3:11:58| could be graveled the cost of a driveway is the cost of the driveway regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11518)|
| 3:12:03| where it's located the one additional cost that may come from putting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| driveway on the off Connecticut Avenue is that a curb cut would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11527)|
| 3:12:12| there's not required off the alley so if there's a desire to reduce the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11532)|
| 3:12:16| the alley may be the most cost-efficient the the standard changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11536)|
| 3:12:23| if we're still built homes to the standards we did and I 1600 would all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11543)|
| 3:12:31| cold in the winter and hot in the summer but and that's why standards change to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11551)|
| 3:12:36| improve our both our homes in our neighborhoods and yes the condition may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11556)|
| 3:12:43| have changed over the since the the house that was on there was constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11563)|
| 3:12:48| but that's at the desire of the neighborhood and again these standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11568)|
| 3:12:52| were putting agreed to by the neighborhood crafted by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11572)|
| 3:12:56| in order to to continue to improve the quality of this neighborhood and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11576)|
| 3:13:00| seem to have worked well based on the attention being given to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11580)|
| 3:13:04| today I grew up in that neighborhood and I don't know who the committee or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11584)|
| 3:13:14| who said that the neighborhood approved all this I have never got one letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11594)|
| 3:13:18| stating for me to come to any meeting to agree with where the parking is you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11598)|
| 3:13:24| I mean the reasonable use of your property should be you know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11604)|
| 3:13:28| that's that's close to the houses that's there but since I've been there I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| lived there 30 years I've never got any type of any type of formal letter stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11613)|
| 3:13:38| me to come to the city or a city county maintenance to have any type of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11618)|
| 3:13:42| stating what type of house what type of parking or anything like that thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11622)|
| 3:13:48| Commissioner Clancy I know everybody's tired and wants to go home but I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11628)|
| 3:13:53| I've got a few things I want to address here in pre-agenda we talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11633)|
| 3:14:00| and at first glance I look at this and every other driveway on that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| comes from the from the street not the alley to which Mr. Green said well it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11644)|
| 3:14:14| promotes looking like a parking lot and I get that I get that coming in from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11654)|
| 3:14:19| alley seems like it's a lot more opportunity to put several cars in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11659)|
| 3:14:23| back of the house as well but if you listen to the applicant's friend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11663)|
| 3:14:34| doesn't work out either because if he rents it to somebody with a handicap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11674)|
| 3:14:38| it's better to access it from the alley it puts it at grade whereas a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11678)|
| 3:14:42| from the street does not put it at grade so it's and it's really saving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11682)|
| 3:14:48| money I think that's my opinion but I really do have a problem with not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11688)|
| 3:14:56| allowing the driveway from the street it looks like it makes sense at first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11696)|
| 3:15:02| glance but I appreciate the fact that the infill housing review committee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11702)|
| 3:15:09| a broader view of what I'm looking at than what I do and when we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11709)|
| 3:15:15| decisions and pass them on to County and sit and County Commission City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| Council I feel like we make a better decision because we've done more more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11719)|
| 3:15:25| research and we've we've looked at it a lot harder than County Commission has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| the opportunity to right then and there they are the legislative body for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11729)|
| 3:15:35| reason I feel like I have to support the the decision-making process that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11735)|
| 3:15:41| infill housing review committee took and I'll make a motion that we deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11741)|
| 3:15:47| appeal we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy a second by Commissioner Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11747)|
| 3:15:55| to deny the appeal however we do have quite a few lights on and I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11755)|
| 3:16:02| hear from Commission Commissioner Smith I kind of feel the exact opposite way I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11762)|
| 3:16:09| mean number one the application that was made was it was the the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11769)|
| 3:16:17| committee approved a front access garage so what I mean the guy has that approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11777)|
| 3:16:24| number two we build houses all over town with front-loading garages with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11784)|
| 3:16:29| front-loading driveways and it just seems like to me I cannot imagine that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| this is this controversial of a thing that it seems like a very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11794)|
| 3:16:39| request the topography of the backyard I didn't realize until I saw the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11799)|
| 3:16:46| you have but you have a down-sloping backyard into where you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| the house so you're going to you are going to spend a lot more money coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11811)|
| 3:16:55| off the alley because you're going to have to manage that grade and tie it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11815)|
| 3:16:59| with the with the house level that faces the front I just you know the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11819)|
| 3:17:05| argument I've heard against using Connecticut Avenue as a dry as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11825)|
| 3:17:12| driveway is that you know some of the houses everybody leaves junk in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| front yard and they it just doesn't look as nice but I mean these same size lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11835)|
| 3:17:21| we build $400,000 houses on and we build them all over town and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11841)|
| 3:17:26| managed to put their things where they belong and I just I think I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11846)|
| 3:17:31| support the applicants right to do what most of his neighbors have done and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11851)|
| 3:17:36| a driveway off the front so thank you Commissioner graph I agree a hundred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11856)|
| 3:17:43| percent with Commissioner Smith and the only thing I want to add is why in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11863)|
| 3:17:50| middle of the block and they all have front-loading garages would you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11870)|
| 3:18:00| one that has to access through the alley that doesn't make any sense at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| that you know if this was over a couple I might be able to say it but it's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11886)|
| 3:18:16| the middle it's not in the middle but there's another next to it yeah it's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11896)|
| 3:18:22| both sides Commissioner Hill thank you madam chair the applicant has asked that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11902)|
| 3:18:30| we use the same criteria and that's exactly what I want to do and if I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11910)|
| 3:18:36| I hope my peers here will correct me but it seems as though he was approved for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| the front cut because of an unusable alley and the facts changed later on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11922)|
| 3:18:50| we now have a usable alley are those the correct facts is that the criteria that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| has changed yes that's correct also this there were sidewalks that were added at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11936)|
| 3:19:02| the front of the property since then and if staff who's running the visuals could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11942)|
| 3:19:11| go could scroll down in the packet there's actually a chart that has that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11951)|
| 3:19:16| color-coded that shows access from the alley driveway access if it's street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11956)|
| 3:19:20| parking only and that shows there are actually several properties along this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11960)|
| 3:19:24| alley that have access off of the alley it's not just this one in the block so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11964)|
| 3:19:29| I'll support this motion based on the change of facts commission reason I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11969)|
| 3:19:36| wanted to say I do appreciate the fact that mr. Fairchild and mr. Kearns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| building building quality small houses and until houses in these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11979)|
| 3:19:44| but I I do think that having a good alley and having improved alley in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11984)|
| 3:19:49| back is an asset and I think it's also safer with a lot of the smaller smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11989)|
| 3:19:53| lots and in cars having to back out into the street for pedestrians and bicyclists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11993)|
| 3:19:58| and and kids to use the sidewalks if you don't have all the vehicles backing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=11998)|
| 3:20:04| so I think we should support the infill housing got commissioner Crowder Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12004)|
| 3:20:12| You madam chair I probably would support a driveway from the front for a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12012)|
| 3:20:18| reasons I wasn't as cognizant about handicapped accessibility to a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12018)|
| 3:20:23| ago and to get a handicapped person up to the alley would be a major unless you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12023)|
| 3:20:30| built a ramp or put retaining walls for that driveway to come down to the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12030)|
| 3:20:35| but I've noticed one other thing it was mentioned that the previous house did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12035)|
| 3:20:41| have a driveway to the front was there a sidewalk or curb cut for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12041)|

| 3:21:16| the driveway was originally right there yes right right there you can see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200312?start=12076)|
