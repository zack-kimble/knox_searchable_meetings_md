| 0:03:22| There are no consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Moving right along to Item 6, my report to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| I want to start this evening with an issue that's on a lot of our minds, and it's the coronavirus, COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| I want to let you guys know that we are responding in full collaboration and partnership with the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=219)|
| 0:03:48| both as a community response and insofar as we employ 1,800 people and need to make sure we take care of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| So I want to update you on our response and also that we've had several meetings with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| both that they've come to the city and met with us as a city, but also that they've had community meetings multiple times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| And I invited Dr. Martha Buchanan to speak to us in just a minute, but I just want to also say that we attend twice a week media briefings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=253)|
| 0:04:25| Local officials are totally prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| This is their job at the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| And just as you all well know, the health department, it's the Knox County Health Department and serves the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| They are our health department, and they have an entire division that deals with contagious diseases, including coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| And they have been really helpful about sharing the information about what the latest news is and how we are responding as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=286)|
| 0:04:57| We now link on our website to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| At the top of our website, you can check it out, and it goes right to the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| And then the health department also has links to the CDC, which has advice on a more national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| The health department has been doing this really consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| I have full confidence in our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| And also, of course, our emergency responders are working closely with their teams of people and the emergency operations and command group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| So there's a lot of community preparedness and public communication, which we plan to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| I fully support transparency in this process and to be as prepared as possible and follow the guidelines that Dr. Buchanan and her well-equipped team of professionals give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=333)|
| 0:05:44| So, Dr. Buchanan, I'd like to invite you to come to the podium and give us a little overview as our leader of our health department to share what you think we need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=344)|
| 0:05:56| And we need to be broadcasting to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Do I need to give my name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Dr. Buchanan, head of the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| I have to do it at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| So anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you, Mayor Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you for those remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you for the opportunity to address city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| As you so well stated, the citizens of Knoxville are also citizens of Knox County, and our job is to protect everybody who lives in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=375)|
| 0:06:25| So first of all, just a little situational update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| As of sometime today, the state of Tennessee now has seven cases confirmed of coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=388)|
| 0:06:37| None of those are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| Those are all in different places across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| I don't know where all of those are because I can't remember at this point how many places they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| But none currently in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| And, you know, worldwide we continue to see cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Across the country we continue to see cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| You know, I anticipate that we will eventually see a case here in Knox County or in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| I would not be surprised by that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| This epidemic, which has not yet been declared a pandemic, continues to spread around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| And to every country in the world will eventually be affected by this, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| So that's kind of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Some other data about the disease itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| Coronavirus is not a new kind of virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| The coronaviruses have been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| They cause the common cold and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| This coronavirus is new, and that's why so many people are getting sick from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| One of the things that differentiates this from the flu is that the flu is something we all have a little bit of immunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| because we've seen it throughout our lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| Either we got vaccinated by it or for it, or maybe we even had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| So our immunity is pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| It has memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| And so when you see a flu virus later on, you may not get so sick from it or you may not even get sick from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| This virus, we have no immunity to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| It's so different from the other coronaviruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Just the number of people that get sick from one person is about twice that of what the flu is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| So more people get sick if we don't quickly isolate people who are confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and keep them in isolation long enough so that they don't make other people sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| The other thing people are always curious about, you know, the death rate with a new virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| Right now, the overall death rate for this virus is 2% to 3% if you take the whole population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| But if you break that down by ages, certainly older folks with chronic illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| their death rate is more along the line of 13% to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| And that goes down as we go down in age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| We don't see a lot of disease and we certainly don't see a lot of hospitalizations or bad outcomes in children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| which is, again, a little bit different than flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| We tend to see a lot of bad outcomes in sicker children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| And there's no vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| We don't yet have an antiviral that would treat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| As with any new virus, it takes time to develop those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| A vaccine is months if not years away, according to what Anthony found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| I can't say Anthony, the guy who used to be in charge of the CDC, said this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| And so we shouldn't be holding our breath for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| So what we have to do is what we're doing now is social distancing measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| encouraging people to stay home if they're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| encouraging people to wash their hands regularly and thoroughly, covering your cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| If you use a tissue, throw that tissue away and wash your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Try to avoid touching your eyes and nose and mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| That's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| And avoiding people who are ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| In places where they have ongoing outbreaks, ongoing community transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| they're discouraging people with chronic illness and older people to avoid crowds and stay home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| So that's a social distancing thing that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| Sometimes you might close a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Some places they are closing schools and taking other measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| We'll consider those measures as things happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| I support a measured and kind of tiered approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| As we see illness moving closer to Knox County, closer to our jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| we will continue to consider options that other places have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| and learn a lot from the other places that have taken those steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| things that worked and things that didn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| and use that knowledge to inform our decisions here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| in concert with the Tennessee Department of Health, the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| as well as local government officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| A little bit about what we're doing in the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| We're doing what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Most of you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| We do contact tracing and isolation and quarantine for people with TB all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| We almost always have somebody who's in quarantine who maybe got exposed to TB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| or somebody we're watching, waiting for their test results to come back to see if they have TB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| so they're in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| So isolation is when you're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| and we're keeping you isolated so you don't make other people sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Quarantine is when you've been exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| and we're watching and waiting to see if you've become ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| So we ask those folks to limit their activities, and we do that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| We do contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| We look at a person who's confirmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| and we look at the people closest around them and test them for the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| and if they don't have the disease, those people further out from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| probably don't have it either, at least not from that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| So it's length of time and closeness of exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| With coronavirus, it's approximately within six feet, less than six feet of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| for over ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| So there's kind of specific requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| It's not passing somebody in the hallway or walking by their room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| It's more intimate contact than that that's required to pass this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| We are screening and testing people regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| We have people that we're watching and waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| We're following all the guidance from the CDC and the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| So some of the guidance has varied based on risk factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| If people are higher risk, they're put in a different category for quarantine than other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| And when we put somebody in quarantine, we have to make sure their needs are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| We either make sure they have family members who can help meet their needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| or we help meet their needs sometimes if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| So that can be challenging at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| My staff is screening phone calls every day from citizens and doctors' offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| the emergency rooms, and anybody who calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| We're actually considering ramping up our phone bank at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| because the call volume has gone up as the situation in the country continues to escalate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| and we get more cases in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| I think what to expect when we get a case, it's not if we get a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| I believe we will get a case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| We will do what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Those of you who have been around for a little bit, you may or may not remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| we announced our first case of H1N1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| We will announce the first case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| We will give very few details about that case in the interest of protecting that person's privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| There's so much fear around this virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| We don't want to put anybody's family or anybody at risk of being ostracized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| or told to go home from work or not being able to work when they're totally safe to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| But the person who's the case will be isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| We'll be checking on them daily, making sure they're staying in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| We'll be doing our contact tracing, which requires a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| It requires a lot of really in-depth questions about specific places the person went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| and what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| And, again, it's something that we're used to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| And then after that, it'll be case count updates on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| We don't want to announce each new case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| If we get more cases, it just kind of becomes redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| What we want the public to know right now is right now in Knox County there are no cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| What you need to do is practice good personal hygiene, washing your hands, staying home if you're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| covering your cough, avoiding people who are sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| We're encouraging employers to look at their sick leave policies to make sure people can be home if they're sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| and not have to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| We understand that that's a challenge for some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| We're asking employers to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| The county is doing that, looking at their sick leave policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| and making sure they're adequate to allow people to be gone if they have to be gone if they do get the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| We're encouraging employers to look at can you let people work from home so they don't come into the workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| potentially get exposed and or bring the virus into the workplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| So can people work from home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| We're in conversation with hospitals and doctor's offices, the schools, the university, local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| event organizers every day talking about what might happen next and what to think about and how to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| A really great resource is our website that links to the CDC's, it's not called the landing page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| it's CDC's microsite that's all about the coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| If you go to the very first link that you go to and scroll down, you'll see the newest guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| It changes every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| I think it's important to point out that just because the guidance changes doesn't mean the people making the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| don't know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| The situation changes and we change because the situation changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| We learn something new and we change the guidance or they change the guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| If we learn something new and didn't use it to change the guidance, that would be kind of silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| So we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| And sometimes it changes rapidly and it can be kind of difficult to keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| We're working with our hospital partners and providers to see how we can help locally improve access to testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| for those who qualify for testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| We're only testing people who qualify per the Tennessee Department of Health guidelines for testing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| You probably heard that commercial labs are going online to be able to test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| I know that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I don't know how much that's getting used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| I think they're really focusing on those areas like Washington State where there are more cases than in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| and maybe New York State where there are more cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| So they're really focusing on those areas to allow more access to testing in those higher risk areas of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=970)|
| 0:16:21| We will be giving regular updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| I will not be giving face-to-face updates very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| There are lots of groups that need to know this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Our plan is to be sending out e-mail updates to elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| and others who need to know this information with the basic information on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| so that we can focus on what we need to do, which is investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| and mitigating risk to the community by helping people stay in isolation and follow our directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| That's really what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Before we get to questions, I just want to say that I've been, as an employer, trying to follow your advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1019)|
| 0:17:07| Yesterday I sent an e-mail out to all City of Knoxville employees reiterating the advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| and guidance that you gave to wash your hands frequently, to cough if you need to into your elbow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| and don't touch your face and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| More importantly, empowering supervisors and employees to know that if they are sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| they are expected to stay home, and if they get sick while they're at work, it's okay to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| That's not just okay, that you're helping the whole community stay healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| In that regard, I also checked with Christina Fitzgerald of Benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| and learned that if people do get sick, 75% of our employees have up to four weeks of paid leave accumulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1065)|
| 0:17:55| I mean, I know that's not 100%, but we do have a pretty good amount of people with some saved up paid leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| and also a sick bank, and if an employee exhausts all of their paid leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| that's something we'll have to cross that bridge when and if we get to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| just as we do when someone has a serious illness of cancer or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| So that's something we can handle on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| But I did send that email out and encourage everyone to stay home if you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Could you share with us just the general symptomology that would precipitate someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| to maybe be required to go to their doctor and potentially be tested if the physician feels that that's appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| So coronavirus, generally folks have a fever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| They'll have respiratory symptoms, tend to be more chest kind of symptoms, so cough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| not so much runny nose and sore throat, although you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Some folks experience shortness of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| And, you know, right now we still require that there's some other exposure for testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| So the three categories of people who the Tennessee Department of Health is now testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| folks who have traveled to an area where there's an ongoing community transmission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| so that's not one case, that's people getting sick in the community, plus symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| fever or cough or shortness of breath, fever, cough, and shortness of breath or shortness of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| Folks who are a household contact to a confirmed case who have become ill will be tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1170)|
| 0:19:40| And then folks who have a severe pneumonia that there's no other diagnosis for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| we can consult with Tennessee Department of Health to consider testing for those folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| I have several questions, just a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| But one, you mentioned that you're getting calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and so I wanted to just clarify if someone wants to report a case or has questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| they feel like they might be feeling symptoms, what is the number that the public should call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| The number that we can call locally is 215-5093.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| That's our epidemiology and emergency preparedness department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| That may be changing because we may be opening a phone bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| We'll get that number out if that does change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| So if people have questions or concerns, they can call that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| and my knowledgeable staff can answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| And then you also mentioned that you want to take a tiered approach depending on what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| you know, how things develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| And so I was wondering, is that tiered approach, is there already a plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and depending on certain signs you'll move to the next tier, or are you developing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Do we have a plan is kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| So we actually, the health department has a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and it is a tiered approach based on where disease is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And a lot of that is about what we do internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| but it's also about what we do in the community, and so we do have that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| We're actually, it's based on pandemic flu, so we're updating it slightly for coronavirus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| because there are some slight differences, and also taking the flu part out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and updating the contact information because that has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| So we do have a plan, and our emergency responders have a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| all of our hospitals have plans for surge capacity and managing patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| Outpatient providers also have plans, so there are plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| And I'm encouraging employers, and the city is an employer just like the county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| we're encouraging households and employers, places of worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| to develop a plan for infection control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| Some places already have infection control plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Some places don't, but that's something to look at at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| And for some of our more vulnerable populations, those living in assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| shelters that are not necessarily managed by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| does our plan include those spaces, or do they have a separate plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| They actually all have their separate plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| We worked with them during pandemic planning to develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| Nursing homes and assisted living facilities all have infection control plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| and have those plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Either this week or next week, we're meeting with long-term care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| I think it might have happened this week with my staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| We're meeting with a lot of people, as you can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| We've met with CARM and talked with them about what their plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and they've gotten that out, I know, and reviewed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| and they have plans to manage folks if they become ill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| I know they actually have ongoing plans for folks who get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| And then my last question is just what capacity do we have as a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| to make sure that we are communicating these plans, protocols, to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1397)|
| 0:23:26| in whatever language is necessary and accessible to our community members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| What is our capacity there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| A lot of our plans are internal, and for community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| we do have a relationship with Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I know that we've talked with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| and actually they're helping us with some interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| The materials that we have at the health department are available in Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| There are a lot of materials on the CDC's website available in multiple languages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| I think if we needed to, we could start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| We certainly use interpreters when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| I know that one of my staff members gave an update to Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| They hosted an event with an interpreter there, which was a first for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| so we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| We know we have other languages spoken in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| and we'd love help communicating with those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| because they are challenging to get information out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Sometimes they come into our facility to be served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| but they're not usually there about coronavirus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| They're there about something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| So we are open to ideas about how we can better communicate with those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Okay, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for coming and talking to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Just kind of following up on what some of my colleagues have asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| considering what you talked about earlier with the transmission of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| what is the recommendation for someone who thinks that they may have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| these symptoms that are going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| And I really ask that in the sense of if we start having, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| it's a matter of when, not if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| If we start having folks going to the ER or going to their doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| there's a possibility that there's a lot of people then that could be exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| including health workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Is there a plan for how to deal with, you know, when you're getting these calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| seeing somebody, you know, I know I've seen images of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| people coming up, pulling up to tents, you know, when they're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| taking temperatures, and I think that's in Italy, but, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| I wanted you to maybe have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Washington too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| In Washington too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Wanted to have you maybe comment on that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It's kind of cool, but you've got to watch out and not get your toes run over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| So those are great questions, and those are always challenging questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| The first stop should always be your doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| If you think you're sick, you need to call your doctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| and then your doctor can advise you on what to do, and they can consult with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| I know people who have questions can certainly call us, but if somebody is sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| we really want them to seek care at their doctor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| because remember, we don't have any cases right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| We still have cases of the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| People still are getting the flu in Knox County, so they might have the flu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and we can save a lot of heartache if they just have the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| So we really want them to be evaluated by their physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| and for that physician to take a good history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| and for them to screen them for things that are more common, like right now, for the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| And then if that's negative and they still are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| and they have an appropriate history to contact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| because still we don't have community spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| So you have to have been somewhere and gotten exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and brought it here for people to be sick right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| That will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| It's changed in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| It's changing in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| It will change here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| But right now, we really want you to start with your provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| If you don't have a provider, there are ambulatory clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| for those who are under and uninsured, Cherokee, Health as a Resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| as well as Interfaith Health Clinic and the free medical clinic out wherever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| I think it's near Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| It's south of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| So we really want you to start with your physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| and for your physician to call us and consult with us regarding testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| and we'll help facilitate making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| So that's ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Certainly, if folks are calling us who are sick and just want us to test them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| we really need that medical evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| We don't want folks going to the ER unless they have a medical emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| If you're just mildly sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| and you think you might have coronavirus or whatever, the flu or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| again, an outpatient visit with your doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1664)|

| 0:27:50| The ER is not the place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| For that, one, you might wait a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| and two, it's a risk of exposure to other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| and exposing other folks to whatever you might have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1681)|

| 0:28:19| Thank you for being on top of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| and we'll stay in touch and we'll help with communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1702)|

| 0:28:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Moving along, in happier news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| in two days from now, the U.S. Census officially gets underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| This Thursday, March 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| you're going to start seeing billboards and Facebook messages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| from community members right here from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| including Pastor Daryl Arnold, Joan Cronin, Yasin Taru, Kumi Alderman, and many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| The main message is you count, so get counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I'm wearing my button today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| I see Councilmember Rogers wearing hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| Get the word out as much as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| It's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| People can, for the first time ever, respond online once they get their thing in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| You can also mail it in or call it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| So there are a lot of different ways to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| At stake is millions of federal dollars for schools, child care, senior care, roads, transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| and public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| So if we get more people in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| that will give Dr. Buchanan more resources to keep us safe and healthy too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| So there's more information at CountMeInKnox.com, the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| I want to thank city employees for making Saturday's 13th Annual Mardi Gras Parade and Festival so successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| There was a huge effort by police, fire, traffic engineering, special events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and a big thank you to public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| The public service crews downtown worked really hard to make downtown look its best before Mardi Gras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| and they stayed late afterward to make sure it looks great afterward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| That's a lot of dogs in one place, and you can imagine it requires some cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| Mardi Gras is enjoyed by 15,000 people and their pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| so thank you to everyone who helped make it a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| It's a great benefit for Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and congratulations to Councilwoman Testerman on a great event, 13th year in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| You always seem to have great weather too, so good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| I want to remind councilmembers that also on Thursday is our public meeting on improvements coming to Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| It's 5.30 p.m. Thursday, March 12th, at the Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| It's open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Just a brief overview of some of the things that I'm committed to is stabilizing the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| making sure Fort Kidd is safe and ADA accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| This is an opportunity for everyone to share their ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| and give their input on what place structures and amenities are most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Good news is that there's a $600,000 budget for the new Fort Kidd, so we can think big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| and there's an item on our agenda tonight discussing the source of one of those donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| You can look at the website, knoxvilletn.gov forward slash news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| to see examples of place structures used in other cities that might inspire ideas for how we want to do Fort Kidd 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| For the many people who cannot attend Thursday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| you can go online and there's a survey, and you can give your input online too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| Another upcoming event is a ribbon-cutting on the so-called Grand Canyon of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| This is 10 a.m. Wednesday, March 18th at Summit Medical Group 7211 Wellington Drive in Council District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| This is a public-private partnership $800,000 project that is fixing the worst sediment pollution site in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| So a big thanks to Summit Medical, which funded more than three-quarters of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| 7,000 cubic yards of soil, 2,300 tons of rock, and then planting of native plant species.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1929)|
| 0:32:16| This will help restore a section of Forth Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| It will stop erosion, flooding, and solves downstream problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| So the ribbon-cutting is March 18th at Summit Medical, and you can see the work in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| Parking is extremely limited because they need the spaces for the clinic patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| so carpool, plan on parking offsite, or take the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| Next, ribbon-cutting is a Commercial Facade Improvement Grant, 2 p.m. Monday, March 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1958)|
| 0:32:46| It's at the business's loveliest bridal boutique and sweet briar boutique on Sevier Avenue, 820 and 822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| Owners Debra and Ken Hill have invested a million dollars in the building and live upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and there are two retail businesses on the ground floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| The city contributed $50,000 to help with the exterior renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| and there's many other Commercial Facade Improvement funding along Sevier Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| including for Computer Systems Plus, Honey Bee Coffee, Landing House, Alliance Brewing, and High Wire Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=1991)|
| 0:33:20| Last thing on my remarks is just want to invite you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| We have a new tool in communications called the Mayor's Minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| and it's a 60-second little video that we're putting out on Monday mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| just sort of capturing the highlights from the week before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| So thank you to Kristen Farley and Tracy McDonald for putting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| I think it's a great way to sort of share in a new kind of medium that a lot of people prefer to watch things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2022)|
| 0:33:49| and learn from videos than writing alone, so just another way to communicate to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| So feel free to share that or offer suggestions as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| That concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Are there any items or reports from Council members you want to share for Item 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2041)|
| 0:34:08| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2050)|

| 0:34:29| who recently passed away last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2069)|

| 0:34:36| and so I think it's a very fitting tribute to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2076)|

| 0:36:54| We're here to discuss four requested variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| The purpose of a variance is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements, in this case of the SW2 zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2217)|
| 0:37:08| Specifically, there must be shown, quote, I'm quoting things that are in your record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| exceedingly irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2232)|
| 0:37:25| which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle, which is preventing an owner from using his property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2249)|
| 0:37:40| This land being developed by your applicant was formerly an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| It was rezoned in 2007 to SW2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| In 2009, it was subdivided to create the shape of the lots under the SW2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| And importantly, the shape of the lots was not created by the relationship of Waterfront Drive to Langford Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| The shape of the lots was created when the land was subdivided in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Tennessee law on variances and the requirements for granting variances in the city of Knoxville require the person requesting or claiming a variance to carry a burden of proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2290)|
| 0:38:22| This is a quasi-judicial proceeding, and that burden has four components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| The second component is the most important, and I'll quote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| The applicant for the variance has the burden of showing, number two, quote, that the literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| The law of variances in Tennessee is very clear, and without a showing of hardship, there is no way to justify a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| What limits your applicant's ability to develop their land according to the zoning ordinance is the developer's own proposed plan of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2328)|
| 0:38:58| a 230-unit multifamily development comprised of 10 buildings and two commercial spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2338)|
| 0:39:06| The developer has many reasonable uses of this land available under the SW2 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| but what this developer is asking you to do is approve variances that reduce the 75% frontage requirement all the way around these lots in order that the developer can build to their plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2351)|
| 0:39:26| not to overcome exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots or any other exceptional physical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| where strict application of the 75% front setback would deprive of the reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| And a variance, I'll remind you, shall be used only where necessary to overcome some physical condition of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| and the lack of such physical condition or hardship does not give the BZA or this body the authority to grant these requested variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2389)|
| 0:40:01| The property is being utilized for the purpose for which it was zoned, SW2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| Under Tennessee law, it is the land, not the contemplated structures, that must be the primary consideration for a hardship analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| The hardship being created by the developer here is personal to this developer because it was created by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| The only hardship existing in this situation is a condition existing not in the land, but in the structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| which this developer wants to create in violation of that SW2 zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Put another way, there are no unique features of the land causing a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Rather, any hardship concerns only the structures being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| A unique hardship from the terrain is nonexistent in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| What limits the developer's ability to meet the 75% frontage requirement on all fronts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| is not the shape or the topography of the vacant lots, but the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| And this development has many reasonable uses for this land, uses that are consistent with the SW2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| That are reasonable, such as duplex houses, row houses, and in summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| simply wanting to build structures different than the code does not meet the definition of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| Section 4.1.1.B of the Knoxville South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| If you reduce the setback requirements, move the buildings closer to the roads, particularly Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| you will obstruct the view further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| Please approve my client's appeal and deny the requested variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2507)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| You have no other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Next, the appellee will get up to three speakers, up to five minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2526)|
| 0:42:26| Hello, my name is Peter Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I'm with Dominion Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| We're at 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| I would just like to start by saying we've worked very hard to design a project that meets the SW2 South Waterfront Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2554)|
| 0:42:43| Not only have we met the code besides these four variances, but we've tried to design a project that's very practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| We operate a lot of apartments, and from a parking standpoint, from visibility standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| we understand the neighbors' concerns about traffic and parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| and feel like we've gone the extra mile in making sure that, from a practical standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| that there's enough parking to not adversely affect the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| I think it's important to point out that we have met the code in all areas except these four variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2594)|
| 0:43:25| because many of the objections that we've heard in our various meetings with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| have to do with specific things that are code-related and not having to do with this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| So I'd just like to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| And I'd really just like to, Sean here handed out some details on the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| and we'd really just like to go over the variances having to do with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| and kind of one by one explain what we're dealing with and what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2635)|
| 0:44:05| We are dealing with a road frontage setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| It's really not a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| It's actually a build-to line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| The South Waterfront Code speaks to having to build within 10 feet of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2651)|
| 0:44:21| We understand the reasoning for this is the intent of the code is to create more of an urban environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| push buildings up towards the road like you would in a big city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| It really is intended for straight roads and a grid system, much like you'd see in an urban environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| which is why we believe we have a unique situation and a hardship in the existing condition of Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2680)|
| 0:44:49| So very quickly, we have four variances that we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| They're all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| They all are the same issue along Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| The first one's in the far corner and then 2, 3, 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| So I've got, I believe you have all those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| and then we'll take them one at a time and I'll show you the effect they have on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| So the green areas on that handout and on my board up here are what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| So as you can see, we have a straight building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| The road is curved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| This is Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| This is Empire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| And we've tried to angle the building as much as possible to meet the requirement of the 75% road frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| but that leaves us with this awkward triangle here because the road curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| So the alternative to all of these is somehow filling the space up with buildings to meet the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| and we don't believe that's in the best interest of the development or the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| So we're asking that these areas be green space, that we're allowed to have some flexibility in how close we build to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2754)|
| 0:46:02| and that we could build in straight lines and, again, leave this green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| And we have the percentage marked on there as far as the percentage of the building that actually meets the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| So that's the first variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| Here's the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Same condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| As you can see, Waterfront Drive curves sharply away from our building, making the same room here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2785)|
| 0:46:34| awkward triangle that we would have to fill up with some sort of building or porch or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| Again, we believe it's better to have a little bit more green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| and a reasonable request based on the curvature of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| So that's the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2807)|
| 0:46:53| The third one, again, this curves pretty aggressively, and it's a long building, so we end up with this space right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2813)|
| 0:47:04| Thirty seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Again, doesn't meet the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| The fourth variance is probably the most visible here with the cul-de-sac that we run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2826)|
| 0:47:17| Again, it's hard to build right up against the road when we have the curvature of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| I just wanted to make sure we were clear on what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| We do believe we have a reasonable request based on the curvature and the existing condition of Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Do you have any other speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| John Sanders is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| He's our architect and can answer any questions, technical questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| I can answer questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Mr. Kline, you have up to two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| What I heard was what I talked about in my remarks, which is we want to put our buildings on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| and we want you to give a variance so we can put the buildings on that we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| The problem is that violates the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| and there is no hardship under the definition of hardship that they would be complying with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| And so you don't have the ability to grant the hardship or the variance based upon no hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| There is no hardship when you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I want to put a building here because this is the building I designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| and it's better because it gives more green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| It gives more green space to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| but it takes away the visibility, the view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| and the rest of the neighborhood's ability to use the area right next to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| which is what they want to invade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| And so, very simply, there's no hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| not as defined by the state of Tennessee law and by your own code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| And because there is no hardship, you can't grant the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2941)|
| 0:49:21| Okay, council members, you may deliberate and discuss what you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I'd like to ask a question of the development group, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| In the event that you do not get this variance, what would be your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2978)|
| 0:49:47| how would that change the scope of what you've presented to us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| Again, the alternative to the variances would be to somehow design the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| within those green spaces that are shown there and fill them up with building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| because that's what the code is saying, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| that the building needs to be built closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| So we would build the building or some portion of the building closer to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| So we don't want that, and we don't think the neighborhood really wants that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| but that would be what we would go design at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| to meet the letter of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| I didn't have my light on, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| Oh, I'm looking at, who's light is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| That's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| There's someone, mystery person's light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| I have a few questions for Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Can you provide a brief overview of the minimum required setbacks for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| There's a 10-foot maximum setback for front yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| and as the developer has articulated, 75% of the buildings need to be in that build-to zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| So it's really, instead of the traditional setback of pulling the buildings away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| and providing front yards, the intent is to push the buildings towards the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| to try and create more engagement for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| In simplest terms, is this variance seeking to increase the distance between the road and the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Or decrease it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| The intent is to pull the buildings away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Is there a maximum lot size for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| The maximum lot size is three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And is there a maximum height allowed for the properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| The standard is a 40-foot high building with three stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| but there are opportunities in the code to allow for an additional 10 feet with a step back in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3124)|
| 0:52:12| and 10 feet plus an additional story if there's a step back in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| And is this plan in line with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| Aside from the variances being considered, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| does this development meet all the specific zoning requirements of SW2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Well, what concerns me here, and it has from the very beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and I have gone through all the material and listened to all the arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| in all due respect to the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| it looks like they're kind of putting the proverbial cart in front of the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| is they designed what they wanted to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| and then want to shoehorn it into an area that our codes don't allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| So that bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| I think that the developers knew the areas that they were working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| They knew what the code was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| and I think the burden, as our law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| is on them to design something that fits a particular property within code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| So if I understand Vice Mayor McKenzie's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| if the variance is denied, all the developer has to do is change nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| other than curve the building and move it close to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| Otherwise, it would comply or take those four buildings out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| and it would comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you, Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Peter Ahrens again, Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| That's a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| If they were to add to the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| thereby decreasing the distance to the street, they would comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| Or take four buildings away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| I'm just saying they could build everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I'm just trying to make the point that the project isn't necessarily going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| to go away because everything else complies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| They could build this without the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| with an amendment to their drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Was it ten buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Ten buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| There were four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| The four comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Well, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| I want to thank both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| particularly for spending weeks and months going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| Both parties met multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| You provided the information to one another that was requested by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| And I'm really grateful for the effort that you both put into trying to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| This is a property that is very special to the first district particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| but also the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| And it requires that amount of going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| So, again, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| I also think that this is a little bit reactive in the sense that we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| plan, south waterfront plan, that's almost 15 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| and code that springs from that hasn't been reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| particularly as it relates to this type of development in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| And so regardless of the decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| I've asked planning to incorporate an update to the south waterfront code as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| part of their work plan for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So the purpose of that would be to get ahead of these situations in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| With that said, I don't think that this is an undue hardship on the part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| There is a way to do this development within the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| So I plan to approve this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Yeah, a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Motion is made to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| And seconded by Mr. Smith and seconded by Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3395)|
| 0:56:41| Just wanted to say that I support the need to review and update the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| waterfront form based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| and I'll certainly have members of my administration work with planning as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| needed to facilitate that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Mr. Swanson, would you clarify exactly what a yes vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| an aye vote means and a no vote means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Because it's a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Sure, because the motion is to grant the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| If you vote yes for this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| then you will be voting to deny the variances and approve the appeal so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| that the variances will not be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| Does everyone understand what a yes vote means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3442)|

| 0:58:03| So, Mayor, I want to move to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| but I would like to read this into the record, please, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| So this is a resolution being presented by Council, my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| Council Members Ryder, Testerman, Parker, and Singh, co-sponsored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| whereas Governor Bill Lee has recently proposed legislation that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| allow citizens to carry guns without an appropriate permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| and whereas while City Council is respectful of the Second Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| a change from the State's current law should be carefully weighed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| and considered, and whereas City Council is of the opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| it is important to consider the opinion of law enforcement agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| and safety organizations who have in the past opposed similar legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Council of the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Section 1, the Council of the City of Knoxville hereby respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| requests that the members of the Knoxville Legislative Delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| consider the opinion of local and state law enforcement agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| as well as safety organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| and oppose legislation that affects current laws regarding carrying concealed guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| And I think it is officially into the record from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3553)|

| 1:02:48| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Could we just use a few moments to clarify the funding for this project and that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| money is coming from this current fiscal year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| My understanding is that the council last year budgeted $300,000 towards this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| and that since then, a community member, Thomas Boyd, has agreed to donate $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3789)|
| 1:03:17| and then there's an anonymous donor who has agreed to donate another $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Is that right, Mr. Brace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| And the CBID actually requested that the Central Business Improvement District, the Downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| Alliance, sorry, Old Habits, has also requested that we submit a funding proposal to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| and we submitted that for $250,000, so there's adequate resources to address any issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3817)|
| 1:03:43| the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| My question would be, this is obviously a beloved site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I love this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I grew up going to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| And I'm sad for any changes, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| But since there's so much love, there's lots of support coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3835)|
| 1:04:02| It seems like, well, tell me the law involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| But, you know, if we had another donor come forward and say, hey, I want to add another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| million dollars to this site, do we still commit $300,000 as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| Is that a done deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| Or do we say, okay, great, we've got a lot of private donors, we can move that where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| there's more need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Mr. Brace, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| I think the $300,000 is actually for the infrastructure component of this, the utilities and the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3867)|
| 1:04:34| and the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| I think oftentimes it's hard to raise dollars for the less glamorous aspects of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| So that $300,000 is committed to address the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| And I think the donors have come forward and been very interested in addressing the amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| the play, the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| No one has gotten really excited about the infrastructure piece, which is not uncommon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| when you do projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| But back to my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| So, million-dollar donor, are we still committed to that $300,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| Well, I guess we could cross that bridge when and if we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| We don't have a million-dollar donor that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| But, Ms. Ryder, were you speaking to that particular question or do you have a new line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| I just didn't know if you wanted to discuss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| I wanted to ask if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| I can wait my turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| Let me answer Ms. Parker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Because what we're doing here is entering into a memorandum of understanding, a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| So, based on what we have right now, entering into that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| we would not be just free to back out of that contract because these people who are committing their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| are doing so based on the city's similar commitment to donate that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| So, for us to simply, if somebody else donated money, we couldn't just back out of this commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| We would have to go to the other donors and say to the other donors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| we have other money that could replace the city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| We would like to revise this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| But it's still a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| So, that's kind of the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you, Ms. Parker, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| I would just like, we've been talking about this, I think, since early 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| So, these were conversations that started with Councilwoman Welch a while back or when she was a councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| I don't know if Mr. Berry or Mr. Brace want to comment on why the conversation started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| It's my understanding from past conversations that there's a retaining wall issue because, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=3997)|
| 1:06:45| there's some failing issues that this isn't just something that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| There's things that have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| And can you address the ADA accessibility aspect of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Hi, Chip Berry, Deputy Chief of Operations for the City of Knoxville, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| So, there's a lot wrapped into what your question is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| So, let me try to pull it apart a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| And, by the way, we can go through all of that at the public meeting on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| and we're going to take it step by step in the initial part of that for the background of how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4035)|
| 1:07:22| So, there is a failing wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| We have a report from engineers that tell us the wall failed technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| And we have to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| In addition to that, we also tested the soil behind that wall, which is supporting Fort Kidd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| and the soils are inappropriate for the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| So, we've got to remove all those soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| So, to do all of that, we also have to remove the components of Fort Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| Now, part of our public meeting on Thursday is to give the public an opportunity to give us feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| through that meeting and through surveys and through several different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| of what they want to see in the new Fort Kidd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| what they like about the current Fort Kidd, and what they want to see in the new Fort Kidd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| so that we are continuing the spirit of Fort Kidd, as Mayor Ken Cannon has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you for the brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4091)|
| 1:08:12| I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Boyd for this wonderful gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| I think everyone agrees that Fort Kidd is something that is really a treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| I'm going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| I wanted to go over a little bit of history here, just for those who don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| but Fort Kidd was actually a community-built playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| It was designed with public ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| It was community fundraising that went on, and it was actually built in 1991 by 2,500 volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4116)|
| 1:08:44| The mayor mentioned earlier that there's a public meeting that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| One thing that I'm concerned with is I know everyone wants to encourage a public dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| public conversation, and I'm really glad we're having that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| There was a letter that was sent out saying that we're going to be having to deal with the failure of the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| and the soil and that demolition was going to have to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| I really wanted to see that public meeting happen first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| I think Councilmember Thomas said earlier, getting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| We really want to encourage that dialogue in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| and so I would have liked to have seen that meeting happen first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| I'm really glad we're having it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| I have a plan to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| This is a really important project that so many folks put so much time into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| and were really so actively involved in that I think it's really critical that we engage the public here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| and I'm glad we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4190)|

| 1:11:41| We have someone to speak, Mr. Wando Stacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| If you could come to the podium and start by saying your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| My name is Wando Stacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| I reside at 734 LaConde Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| Good to see you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| And I'm glad to see that this money is in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| and I'm just asking that this money is in 11G to go into more proactive use instead of a reactive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4322)|
| 1:12:15| Now, I understand it's for more security in the schools, but I feel like it would be best used if we look into training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| number one, mental health in the schools, training the staff to recognize these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| instead of reacting and locking the young adults up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| So I basically want to see this in a more proactive way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| and we will try to bring any suggestions that are needed to help fund that money properly in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4359)|
| 1:12:52| Thank you so much, Mr. Stacey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| Now, council members, feel free to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| So thank you for your comments, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| I just actually want to ask Chief Thomas or whoever the appropriate person is to just give us a high-level overview of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| what exactly this grant is going to cover as far as the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| I understand your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I'm not certain that they will fit into this particular grant, but definitely some areas of opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| and maybe we can look for grants that are more specific toward that as well in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| Those are great ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| This grant is actually a pass-through grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| So it's actually we're accepting it on behalf of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| They will be getting that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| So how they're spending it will be the security division of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| There is just a component for us for training of our SROs, our school resource officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| A very small amount will be used for that, but most of it is going directly to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| But they had to have a city ask for it, so we asked for it on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Thank you, Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| This is also for Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| The VOCA funds, I guess in G, is that also a pass-through grant that's going to the Family Justice Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| It's actually a grant specifically for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| but we have three advocates and a supervisor that do work with our special crimes unit at the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| The other advocate that it's funding works with our violent crimes unit on behalf of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| to provide relationships with families of victims and victims themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| So it's actually for a supervisor and four victim advocates, their salaries for a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| So the last position is not for domestic violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| It's actually for a violent crimes unit, victims of murder, suicide, rape, robbery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| She's actually in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| She is the go-between between the investigators and the families or the victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| It's been a great help to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| I believe the state has a lot of VOCA monies that weren't used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| and I'm wondering if that's a place that we can apply for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| because that's also what you were talking about, I think, Mr. Stacey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| about getting money for the victims of shooting violence in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| Those are actually for funding the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So what we have to do is we have to, should those grants run out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| show that we can fund those positions, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| So we are very careful on how many hires we make and how many funds we ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| because should those funds go away after these two years, we still have those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| We either have to let them go or we have to fund them as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| It's just specifically for positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Just one last point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| And so, Chief Thomas, since you're stating that for this specific grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| it's going to be passed through and they will go directly to Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| So with that said, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I would encourage you, because I do think that the school board would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| and the county commission would like to hear your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| and your thoughts around the uses for these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| if you wouldn't mind to share that with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Because they will be controlling where this money is gone and how it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| The resolution reads that the funding would expand security at schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4572)|
| 1:16:22| but there are no details in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| How would this expand security in schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| That I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| I don't have that in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| It's actually going to go to Knox school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| I'm assuming that they're trying to increase the number of officers that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| in the schools, but I would have to talk to Chief Pedusas and the school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| And why does Knox County not apply for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| I'm not sure of that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| Ms. Parker, I think it's because the Department of Justice gives money to police departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4607)|
| 1:16:53| not to school boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Not to sheriff's departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| We have a very good grant writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| That may be why, but I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| But if we're the ones who approve it but we don't have any answers to any of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| because we don't administer the money, that's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4631)|
| 1:17:21| Do we know the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| Ms. Parker, your frustration is recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| I'm looking at this to see if we knew what the dates were of when it needed to be turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| I'm looking here in the grant routing form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4661)|
| 1:17:51| Pause for a moment and see if we can figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| I don't have that with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| I'm looking at what we've got to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4676)|
| 1:18:06| Ms. Ryder, I guess, and Ms. Parker, one question is if we postpone this for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| and ask some questions of the school administration, is there any harm to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Would it inhibit their ability to get the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| I don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| If it would give some sense of comfort, I would be okay to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| to get some of the answers to the questions Councilwoman Parker raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| but I would not want to delay it and sabotage getting the funds, and I cannot quite see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| I don't know if Mr. Boyce would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| I guess not, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| You guys have a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| Mr. Boyce, if you could come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| Mr. Boyce, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Mr. Evans, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Oh, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| It was Councilwoman Ryder that led me astray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Boyce Evans, Deputy Finance Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| The bottom line is that would be in the grant application document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| which I do not think you have in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| I know I didn't bring a copy of it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| That's when that would be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| We can always follow up with Gus Baducis and find that out for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| and get something out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| but my strong recommendation would be to proceed with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| I will say here in the packet, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| we've had a few days that we could reach out to staff and ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| but here in the packet it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| the grant will pay for the continued funding of the salary and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| for the victim services coordinator and three victim advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| as well as travel and training, services and supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| and the cost of providing assistance to victims of violent crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| I think that's a different item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| Yeah, we're on I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| So, Mayor, I just want to comment to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| I think that these are some very valid points that have been brought up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I'm not of the opinion to stop funding, grant funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| if we have applied for it and we've received it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| to be able to pass on to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| but I do think going forward when these grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| maybe we need to just ask for a little bit more additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| if needed, going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| but I'm not of the opinion to postpone or delay the process for accepting the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4831)|
| 1:20:39| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| Bugut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Thank you, Madam Chair, or Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| What board are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| What I was going to say is it says in here that it's for equipment, radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| first aid, some of that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| That's what the School Violence Prevention Program can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| some of the funds can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| I would just encourage us to go ahead and approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| and let the Board of Education do its due diligence on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| I simply just wanted to thank Mr. Stacy for his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| You've given us food for thought in issues similar to this, in this particular one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| and I also want to thank you for the good work you do in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| The motion on the floor is to approve the resolution authorizing me to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| the application for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| Seeing no further discussion, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=4907)|

| 1:23:23| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| I had a question about this item and the next two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| I guess this is for Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| Can you help me understand why the cost for Lakeshore is the same as the cost in Inn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5015)|
| 1:23:49| which is seven other parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Yes, Chad Weth, Public Service Director, City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| Lakeshore, if you look in the packet, there's a map in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| We don't maintain all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| There's different sections of Lakeshore that is maintained by that foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| so it varies as to what we maintain at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| Also, the size of all the other various sites as far as the other two contracts are concerned also varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| All of these go out for separate evaluated bids to determine who the winners of the contracts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5056)|
| 1:24:23| Are you saying it's based on the size?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| It's based on several things, the size, the complexity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| Obviously, if it's mowing versus landscaping, that makes a difference as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| While Lakeshore is very large, it's also pretty easy to mow because a lot of them are wide-open areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| When we put these out for RFPs, we provide all the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| and then those contractors that wish to apply go and look at the sites and determine the prices that they bid on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5085)|
| 1:24:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5094)|

| 1:28:02| and to encourage them to respond to invitations to participate in the 2020 Census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5282)|

| 1:28:11| and an undercount would mean that city residents are not politically represented as fully as deserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5291)|

| 1:30:38| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Operable vehicles, whether it's a bus or whether it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| we look to see that it's got a tag that's not expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| We look for the obvious broken portions of a vehicle, flat tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5447)|
| 1:30:55| In certain cases, we do actually go out on site and ask the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| or the occupants of a residence or property to show proof that it is operable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| but usually it's pretty clear when we start looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| But if we do see something that's questionable, we'll start investigating further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| There's actually an ordinance that, in a previous life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| Mr. Swanson and I drafted regarding operable vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| And then the second part was determining that a vehicle is parked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| or stored for more than 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| That one is slightly more difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| As I'm told from our law department, that we are unable to chalk tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| and so with the inability to do that, we would be forced to go ask the tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| or occupant, it appears that your vehicle has not moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| And so we would basically go by their word as to whether it has or has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| We could begin a dialogue indicating it appears to be in the same location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| based on snow, based on evidence around the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| But ultimately, it would be very difficult to prove that it has not moved in 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5533)|
| 1:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| I'm trying to figure out how to even ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| What I really want to ask is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| For codes, whether something operates or not, what does that matter to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5564)|
| 1:32:55| I think the intent of this section of the ordinance is to try and limit the opportunities for a dirty lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| to really limit folks accumulating what the neighborhood would consider junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5581)|
| 1:33:08| And so they're trying, the intent behind this is to try and set some reasonable standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| to protect the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| I am, you know, these types of changes to our code are the ones that make me really nervous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| and I think are very unfortunate because if you've lived in a city that enforces codes like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5608)|
| 1:33:36| it can be a nightmare and it can be a nightmare for poor folks who, you know, your car breaks down for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| and then all of a sudden the financial implications of that just continue to grow and grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| and you feel harassed by your city and you feel like you're just poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| and you need time to fix something rather than having to tow it away and get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| So I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you, Ms. Parker. Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I would just like to clarify that what we're voting on is an ordinance to allow churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| and residential zone properties to be able to have buses that support their programs voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| or I'm sorry, parked on their lots and to make it legal for the first time in 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Yes, ma'am. That's what Section B is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Section D, which has slight limited changes, is just for clarity's sake, but not changing the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| So you are correct. Part B is all about recognizing that there are churches and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| and residential neighborhoods that have buses associated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| Okay. Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Thank you, Ms. Ryder. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5690)|

| 1:36:12| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| Is this the language that we have seen in the previous code or has there been some change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| This language is slightly different than what was previously adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| The dates have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| And so the date that is inserted now, which was previously, if you had a, in a nutshell, try not to get deep in the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| but if you could show that you had a lot of record by deed all the way back to February 3 of 1947,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5794)|
| 1:36:42| you could move forward with getting it platted on the ward map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| We talked pretty heavily with the technical services group and realized that July 8, 1971,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| is the beginning of what we have are the modern subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| And so we thought that would be an appropriate date to set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| So if you can show that you've had a lot by deed back to the beginning of the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| we would recognize that and provide a path forward to legalizing that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5829)|

| 1:39:44| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5984)|

| 1:39:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| First of all, from the looks of this and the review of the documents, I want to applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| you for trying to improve that area of Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| My question and concern is, you know, that area with some flooding, I think that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| may be on a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| What kind of configuration are you going to have about parking, whether it be a permeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| surface or a smaller surface for your parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| We actually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| The footprint outside is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| We are putting drainage in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| We've already started a drainage process, laying out the drawings and so on for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| But it's going to drain a lot better than it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| That's the only question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| Thank you, Mr. White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Any – oh, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| So this is just for property that you own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6063)|
| 1:41:15| We have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| The first person is Mr. Scott Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| Is Mr. Davis still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Or – Mr. Davis, calling once, calling twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| You're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| We're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| The next person who signed up is Greg Duthie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| Greg Duthie, 2619 Seton in the Island Home Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| Compliment time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| And suggestion time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| Mayor, I realize that the lost sheep ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6116)|
| 1:42:01| and the naming of Maxine Rains Road and December 5th for Maxine Rains Day happened before you were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6121)|
| 1:42:12| Probably some of council was involved with that, and most of you might know we lost Maxine Rains last Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6132)|
| 1:42:21| in front of a significant people who died in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| I was at her funeral last night after driving 750 miles from my own father's funeral in Wisconsin the night before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6146)|
| 1:42:35| so I wanted to thank the city for honoring Maxine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| and ask for continued support of the lost sheep ministry now in its 30th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| It happens every Wednesday night under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| and I'd like to invite council members and our community to come down on Wednesday nights at about 6 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| and care and see the many homeless people that have been helped for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| So thank you to the city and those that were involved in a ministry that's very special to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| Wanted to briefly mention Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| As I just said, my father passed away about a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| and I like staying in contact and building relationships with city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| and I would encourage the city populace to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| Get to know your city council members, get to know your neighborhood association folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| and the movers and the shakers and the many public service people that help us in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| Do that before you need something or want something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| Compliment them. They will work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| I can tell you that to the best of their ability, so I want to thank you, Seema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| After I mentioned in my e-mail, I got a personal phone call with her condolences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6241)|
| 1:44:09| That is the kind of people that serve our city, and I'm sure many of you are the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| That meant a lot to me, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| The main thing I wanted to update Council and our new mayor on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| is something that's been a burden to the city for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| and that is how we handle our abandoned cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Early in Mayor King Cannon's campaign, I spoke to her and got support for moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6271)|
| 1:44:39| that the city would support us in cleaning up, in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| the three historic African-American cemeteries on Keith and Richmond Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| namely Longview, Crestview, and Southern Chain cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6289)|
| 1:44:55| We initially made some substantial efforts in cleaning up the overgrown cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I wanted to thank Mr. Brace and Chad West for their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| We secured the gates at Longview Cemetery, removed drug paraphernalia, garbage, and tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| cleaned it up, and we made some big baby steps towards revitalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| those very, very special and historic cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| We set up an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I want to provide that again for any council member or those in the viewing public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| It's all lowercase letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Save historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Sorry, I'll start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| Save Knox historic cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| Save Knox historic cemeteries at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6344)|
| 1:45:52| We're in the planning stages of moving forward by developing a cemetery committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| I know that Ms. Singh, Dave Brace, Chad West, and Vice Mayor McKenzie are familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6359)|
| 1:46:09| and have toured those cemeteries last spring and this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| We made a lot of headway with Ivan Harmon and the jail crew by keeping Crestview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| in particular mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| The major work on this 10.1-acre, three-cemetery plot is to work on the Longview Cemetery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6385)|
| 1:46:35| which is really overgrown with certain trees that are just kind of noxious trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6395)|
| 1:46:43| They grow overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| And we're also working along with the Neighborhood Association to revitalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| that Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| Moving forward, I'll be back again to update the community about an organizational meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6412)|
| 1:46:59| that we'll probably have over at the public service building off of Middlebrook there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| I was on the phone last night with Mr. Sam Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| Some of the African community that's lived around here for a long time might remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| that his family was in the funeral home and mortuary business in the 40s, 50s, and 60s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| and personally buried many well-known and lesser-known African Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6443)|
| 1:47:31| up in the Longview Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| I spoke with him last night on the phone for about an hour, and I personally met him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6453)|
| 1:47:38| a couple times at the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| So he's really looking forward to helping with this major project and, as some said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| a big can of worms because there's a lot of work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| My goal, as I see, in spearheading this that was originally spearheaded with a lot of anger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6470)|
| 1:47:58| like how could this happen, and then not knowing why and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| is to pass the reins along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| About 30 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| To whoever would like to take over those reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Ideally, as I see it, this committee would be a diverse committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| and hopefully some significant African Americans could spearhead this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| And I'd like to be involved with that, and we thank the city for their continued support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| in any way that they can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6506)|

| 1:48:56| Mr. Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| I know this is outside of typical protocol, but Mr. Roach did not make it to the meeting in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| for public forum, and pending your re-approval and Council's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| he had requested the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| Pending your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| I'll make a motion for Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| Mr. Roach, please come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6555)|

| 1:49:20| Thank you for the privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| Rick Roach, 244 Victoria, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| I have a question, which I know I shouldn't ask during public forum, but I'm going to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6567)|
| 1:49:34| There have been a couple of incidences where I was viewing a conversation on cable TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6574)|
| 1:49:43| and the subject came up again at a community forum, and it has to do with the Homemakers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6583)|
| 1:49:52| There was some information that came out that kind of threw me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| I generally had accepted the importance of the Homemakers program in certain revitalization efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6597)|
| 1:50:06| but then a couple of the details came out about how one participates in the Homemakers program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6606)|
| 1:50:15| and how people have been recruited from outside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| and also outside the state of Tennessee to participate in the Homemakers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| And it just kind of hit me that it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| It doesn't work with me, especially for the 6th District, parts of the 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6631)|
| 1:50:41| To me, it doesn't work because you're not focusing on the people in those districts that are in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6641)|
| 1:50:49| and they would love to be able to participate in a program like the Homemakers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| So I would ask that city council direct whoever needs to be directed, community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| to review the parameters of qualifications for the program, to participate in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| It is of most importance, and I don't see how, especially in these times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| in the crucial period of time that we're in here in Knoxville, that you can have a program that brings people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| And with the other issues that we have, especially with homeless population, how you can have people coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| and basically have the Homemakers program be a vehicle for investment opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| instead of truly stabilizing and revitalizing communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6691)|
| 1:51:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6697)|
| 1:51:38| Thank you, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200310?start=6702)|
