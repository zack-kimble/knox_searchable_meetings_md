| 0:00:59| that if Councilman Bailey would lead us in the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=59)|

| 0:01:50| Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| I think since Councilman Brown was thoughtful enough to pray for him, if you'd go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=111)|

| 0:03:38| Regional Medical Center for proposed new signs and wayfinding measures on the hospital's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=218)|

| 0:03:48| Public Policy up on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Anyone with an interest in the long-range planning of Fort Sanders' neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| other surrounding areas is invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| Also, the City of Knoxville is partnering with Waste Connections to launch a pilot recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| program in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| The project is set to begin this week and will feature receptacles located at approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| 20 different locations downtown for recyclable material, including aluminum cans, bottles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| glass containers, plastic cups, and mixed paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| The pilot program grew out of discussions in one of the city's Energy and Sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Task Force committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Waste Connections, who is the city's contractor for household garbage pickup, is working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| the city to collect the recycling data and is providing the financial support to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| And just a reminder, rumor has it that early voting is happening right now all around Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| County and will happen through Saturday and Election Day is Thursday, August 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Rumor has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Since you mentioned that, I wanted to mention the change in location, especially in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| from the Five Points voting location to now Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And I think some people may not be aware of that, so I wanted to let that be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Also, as the council representative to the CAT Board, the new place was scheduled to be open on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=305)|
| 0:05:15| August the 13th at 11 a.m., and I'm sure you'll get more information on that, but I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| administrative offices are now open, and so I think it's going to be a plus for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| So Austin East is the location for East Knoxville for early voting as opposed to what used to be the Five Points Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Yes, I'd like to announce that this Thursday there will be a meeting on the Flanagan Project in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| at 6 o'clock being held at the South Knox Community Center, beginning at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| Date, one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| This Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Okay, thank you, the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| One, I want to just remind everybody that the Lonsdale Homecoming is coming up on Saturday, the 7th of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| a big event at Sam Hill School Park every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| The population of Lonsdale quadruples that day, and it's a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| There's some great food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| You all should come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| I think it starts at 10, but I could be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| The best time to be there is actually around mealtime because the food is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| Second is a vice mayoral sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| We have got a request from the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| They want to go over their communication plan, which is something we've asked them to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=398)|
| 0:06:44| and they want to go over some of the updating of the Tenure Plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| I think they refer to it as Tenure Plan Version 2.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| It's been in the works for about a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| I want to recommend we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| I know this is an important subject, and I think because this is an answer to a question from Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I think it's worth our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| I want to ask Ms. Mitchell if she can get an e-mail out just checking Council workshop dates with everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| and we'll let that get scheduled as quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 5 of the City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| so as to authorize residents to keep limited numbers of domesticated chickens on a noncommercial basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| Requested by Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| I would like to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Council Member Woodhull, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| I have passed out an ordinance that includes some revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| Does everybody have, do my colleagues all have a copy of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| I'd like to, first off, go through a little bit of the history of this real briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| and then cover the revisions before we go and listen to the people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| Are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| First off, just to refresh your memories, the purpose, as stated in this ordinance, for this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| is the purpose of this section is to provide standards for the keeping of domesticated chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| It is intended to enable residents to keep a small number of female chickens on a noncommercial basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| while limiting the potential adverse impacts on the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| The City recognizes that adverse neighborhood impacts may result from the keeping of domesticated chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| as a result of noise, odor, unsanitary animal living conditions, unsanitary waste storage and removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| the attraction of predators, rodents, insects or parasites, and nonconfined animals leaving the owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| This section is intended to create licensing standards and requirements that ensure that domesticated chickens do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| adversely impact the neighborhood surrounding the property on which the chickens are kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| So the original ordinance that we created, actually thanks to Angela Robber of City Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=540)|
| 0:09:09| she's done some fabulous work on this ordinance, was intended to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| After we passed this ordinance on the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| Councilman Roddy recommended wisely that I meet with the stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| meaning those people who we're going to administer, work with, be impacted by this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| And so I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I had two of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| It was challenging, and we postponed a couple times due to vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| due to the fact that one of the lead urban hen coalition people was gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| and I needed to catch him up on where we had gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Now, I did not see this necessarily as a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| but I definitely saw this as an opportunity to sit down and listen to people tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| everybody from law to animal control to urban hen coalition proponents to concerned citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=602)|
| 0:10:12| who were inclined actually not to support this, Gary Norman, building inspections, Anita Cash, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| Tim Adams, Young Williams, another concerned citizen, Jim Pierce, who I believe is going to be speaking tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| Tom Reynolds, and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| So I had two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| I listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| We did more than just listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| We had conversations about this ordinance, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| So let me go to the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Actually, the revisions can be, there are four areas that I wanted to call your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=642)|
| 0:10:53| The first one is under the first block of red that you come to, section 2B1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=653)|
| 0:11:02| There's an addition that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| in addition, the permit authorizes the keeping of chickens only upon the property described in the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| The permittee must occupy the residence on the property where the chickens are kept as his personal primary residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| An applicant for a permit must either own the property or have permission from the property owner to be eligible for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| Only one permit is allowed per permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| The idea there is that the owner of the property needs to give permission for a resident, a renter, to have chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=685)|
| 0:11:41| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I thought I heard it had to be a male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| Non-funny joke over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| If that permittee moves or even gets tired of hens, the owner is not allowed to just pass that permit on to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=709)|
| 0:12:01| As a matter of fact, that location is not able to have another permit for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| So we wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Going to number, the fees, we've moved the building permitting fee from $25 to $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=729)|
| 0:12:17| That's the second area I wanted to point you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Now, three, this is under F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=740)|
| 0:12:28| And F, the original ordinance had a separate section for enclosures and hen houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| There was some concern about, and we've conflated both of these categories into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| Just so you're clear, an enclosure is what you might think of as the pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| The hen house is where the hens are at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| And so it was confusing to have both of those sections separated, and so we brought them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=775)|
| 0:13:04| And, of course, by doing that, the original ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| we had to make lots of adjustments in terms of changing the numbers and the letters as the ordinance unfolds, because we've combined two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=788)|
| 0:13:17| So a lot of the edits are connected to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| Now, if you look at G, G is actually an additional section under food storage and removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=800)|
| 0:13:34| This is a new section, or at least two new sentences, a new section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| All stored food for the hens must be kept either indoors or in a weather-resistant container designed to prevent access by animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| Uneaten food shall be removed daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Additionally, under waste storage and removal, the option of keeping three cubic feet of manure stored has been eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| So that's no longer an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| So broadly speaking, those are the four revisions that have come out of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| And those are the revisions and edits that I would like to move to include and amend the ordinance, to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=850)|
| 0:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| So there's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| On your first one, I was suggesting in, I guess that's B1, that you change the his to the owner's apostrophe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=870)|
| 0:14:41| How about the permittees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| The permittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| You know, keep it gender neutral just so that we don't have the curse of the male pronoun anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=884)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| You want an inclusive version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Beyond that, I had submitted several suggestions to you, but I see they're not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| I don't know whether we need to act on this and then act separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| So I'll withhold the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Just as a reminder, we can discuss those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| There are folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| So I don't know if you want to vote on the amendments or have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I'm looking for a sense of counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| And before you do that, might I suggest, and I'm sorry, I didn't see this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| you furnished this to me earlier, but in subsection C, changing the fee to $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| since you are now required under this to have both hen house and fenced enclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| might that last or in that sentence be changed to and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Because you're not going to charge a $50 fee for a hen house and a $50 fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| additional $50 fee for the fenced enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| It's going to be one $50 fee for the both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| So change that word to and rather than or, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Sorry, I didn't pick that up earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| And also chicken pen would need to be changed to be consistent fenced enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| That's under fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Now, Mayor, I wanted before the people came up to speak to have all the revisions put on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| so all the material is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| All right, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| And on the $50 fee, why that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Why did it go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| I guess, one, because it communicates a level of seriousness on the part of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| who are going to engage in creating this feature to their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| and two, it's going to require more work on the part of building permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| I just don't understand why we, I mean, if there was a reason, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| if it was to pay for the expense of the inspectors or this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| but just to throw another $25 on there just to say that they're serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| I mean, they're serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| I don't know how we think they wouldn't be serious if they're going to go through the trouble of a hen house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| and the enclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| I mean, that's serious there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| I mean, that's going to be, I remember at the meeting in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| the hen houses cost up to $1,200, $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| That's pretty serious to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| And just to throw another $25 on there, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| Unless it's to cover, again, permitting process or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| cover the city's cost of administering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| That's a good challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And I can't really provide for you where that additional $25 needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| That was definitely something that came out of our meetings to increase the permitting costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1083)|
| 0:18:12| Can we change that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Do I need to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| You obviously are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| You obviously are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Let's go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Let's go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We'll go through it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Why don't we hear some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| We might come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| And then I will remind you, I know there's folks out here to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I haven't brought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I was going to make a process question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| What I heard Councilman Woodall say is let's get all the things like that on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| And it feels like, I don't know, I started writing things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I don't know if somebody else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| But to say here are the things that are worth talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| And I actually kind of like the idea of getting them down before we hear from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| That allows them to address all the different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And I know Councilman DellaVolpe said he has several things he wants to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| And I think that was your idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| So, Councilman Pavlis, you're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Well, I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Let me, in the spirit of that last discussion, let me get at least two of those thoughts out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| that I think folks need to be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| One is that I think that no enclosure or hen house can be permitted in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| Now, maybe that's a given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| But we have a city environment, and I think that this should be, whether we phrase it in the positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| enclosures and hen houses shall be in the backyards or rear yards or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| whether we have no in the front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| But I think that's important because I think we are looking at keeping our city healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| and improving in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| Secondarily, I had made a suggestion, and I know we've postponed the action on this a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| but in the final area where it has denial, suspension, or revocation of the permit, which, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1189)|
| 0:19:57| that would be the last section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| It's now lettered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Yeah, page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| It's now lettered I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| I'm not trying to figure out what the number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| L, you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| L, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I think we should put at the tail end of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1211)|
| 0:20:13| The Animal Control Board shall have the right to enter the permitted property during reasonable daylight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| to inspect the hen enclosure and condition of the animals in the enforcement of this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| and shall have the authority to enter the property at any time in case of emergency or health threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| and to remove chickens from the premises if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| So that was a two-part thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| One is reasonable daylight hours for inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| The second is if there's a health threat or issue that they have a right to enter and do what they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| because health comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| So anyway, those are the two main suggestions I wanted to have on the table before the discussion from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| This is to Mr. Pavlis's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| We had a little bit of a discussion last time about what would be required from building and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| to enforce this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Uh-oh, what happened to Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| I didn't – yeah, he was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| He's talking to building inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Ah, okay, building inspections is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Mr. King, I had a question for you regarding building and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Regarding Mr. Pavlis's question about the increase in the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| help me to understand if someone brings in their plans for the fenced enclosure and hen house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| or do each of these require a site visit by someone from your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Well, there has been a change that would eliminate one visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| but initially we were concerned that we would have to review the plans in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| and then review the surrounding structures to determine the building material and color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| That has been removed, as I read this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| But the $50 fee would cover the review of the plans and an inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| and that is pretty much a minimal cost to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| And so, yeah, you'll not only review in the office, but then you'll send someone out for a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Now, forgive me because I don't keep chickens, but can you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I thought maybe you could order a small enclosure, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| like maybe just for two chickens, pre-built, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| like go to a store and just buy it and bring it home like a dog kennel or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| In that case, does someone under this ordinance have to go through the submission of their plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| My understanding, they would at this point, the way it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| So anyone who wants to have chickens has to have an enclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| and even if that enclosure comes pre-done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| they would need to bring in some kind of drawing of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| and then your department would have to send somebody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Okay. Well, that clarifies what the fee would cover, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Ellen Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Section B, number one, after the large amount of red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| in the event the permittee is absent from the property for longer than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Sixty days is a very long time for someone to be absent and to have neglected hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| I'm not saying they would be neglected, but I think there's great potential there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| and I would like to see that reduced to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Okay. We'll note that in kind of our working list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Councilwoman Holden, is your light on for now or later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Okay. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Okay. I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| I'm going to go ahead and go to our speakers now unless somebody wants to stop me from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| Okay. This is our practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| We'll hear first for those in favor and then those opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| and then there's a two-minute rebuttal from one person of those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| The two I have signed up in favor are Stephanie Welch and Chad Helwinkel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| Everybody just remind or start by giving us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Hello. I'm Stephanie Welch, 2137 Hillsborough Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor Becker, City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| I am here representing the Knoxville-Knox County Food Policy Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| and as this is the first time as the chair of the Food Policy Council that I've been before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| I thought I would just take a minute to tell you a little bit about what the Food Policy Council does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| The Food Policy Council was established in 1982,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| and it's actually the longest-serving food policy council in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| It consists of 11 members, and the members are appointed by both the city and the county mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| Our purpose is to assess the community's food system in terms of cost, availability, accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1467)|
| 0:24:35| implications for public health, and implications for economic health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| We also are tasked to identify food system issues of concern to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| act as a forum for discussion and coordination of community-wide efforts to improve our food system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| and to communicate those recommendations to bodies such as yourself and to the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| So in February of 2010, we voted as a Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| We reviewed the ordinance that was drafted at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| We reviewed the ordinance, and we voted to support the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| and there were a few reasons that we voted to do so, so let me tell you a little bit about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| One of the values of the Food Policy Council is food accessibility and self-sufficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| and our feeling is that egg-producing hens, at a basic level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| are a very affordable and nutrient-dense source of nutrition for community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| Now, I do want to note that the building permit fees bring into question some equity issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1536)|
| 0:25:46| and that also is another value of the Food Policy Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| We do value equity in the way that we establish policies in making sure that food is accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| and affordable to all community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| The council also values sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and backyard hens do allow residents to produce eggs for food in both a humane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| and environmentally friendly manner if they choose to follow this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| or to apply and get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| The council also values community empowerment and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and we feel that by creating a legal mechanism for community members to raise chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| and thus produce eggs, this ordinance opens up a line of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| between existing educational resources in our community and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| It also opens up a line of communication between community members who are participating in hen husbandry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| so we support it for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| So, again, accessibility, self-sufficiency, sustainability, and community empowerment and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| we feel like this ordinance does assist with all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| So, of course, we realize that this ordinance is not a fix for our food system overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| but we do feel like ordinances such as this are a really important step to assuring that our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| has a health-focused food system that is sustainable, equitable, and accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| So we appreciate your time and consideration, and if you have any questions, I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Chad Helwinkel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Hi, my name is Chad Helwinkel, 1625 Jefferson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| You have before you tonight an ordinance that is the result of a year and a half of negotiations with many stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Over a year ago, Animal Control Board and the Urban Hen Coalition took as a starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| the most detailed existing city code on how to properly care for hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| and at the time that was the South Portland Maine code that we took as a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| As we have listened to different stakeholders over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| this proposed ordinance has been amended to include their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| We've listened to hen supporters' wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| We've listened to Animal Control's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| We've listened to health officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| We've listened to opponents of hens and their worries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| and we've listened to city officials in buildings and in codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| With the help of the city law department, the ordinance now has exact language spelling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| how to properly keep hens in backyards without creating a noise, health, smell, sight, or rodent problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1711)|
| 0:28:41| With this legislation, hen keepers will know exactly what is expected of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Additionally, Animal Control will have an ordinance with teeth if the rules are not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1725)|
| 0:28:51| We started out with a simple mission, to get permission to keep a few hens for eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| The process has not been simple, and it has not been simple to accomplish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| We've learned that you don't get everything you want, and compromise is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| Several coalition members were not happy with the reduction in the number of hens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| and the increase in building permit fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| But overall, the coalition is still very supportive of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| I know this issue has taken a considerable amount of each of your time and city officials' times as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and we thank you for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So now we urge you to vote in favor of this ordinance, give us an avenue to raise hens for their eggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| give our neighbors the assurance of no health, noise, smell, sight, or rodent problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| and give Animal Control the teeth to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| Here we have two folks signed up to speak in opposition, James Pierce and Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1787)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| James Pierce, 122 Leonard Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| I am not here to represent any neighborhood group or other organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| I'm simply here concerned how this ordinance could affect my property value and quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| I want to thank Councilman Woodhull for allowing my wife and I to participate in the two stakeholders' meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I think many points of concern were raised, and I hope we can find solutions to those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| I did receive your amended ordinance today, and I did see some issues were addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| and I still need to address more here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Reviewing this ordinance, I feel it is slanted much further toward the freedom to keep hens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| than it is to protect neighbors' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| There must be specifications written into this ordinance that protect neighbors from the worst possible abuse of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| If you do not do this, we can expect that such abusers will use the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| nonspecific language of this ordinance as justification, and they will likely be within their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| We deserve better protection than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| I want to address some specific areas of this ordinance so you will better understand the concerns I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| I'll be referring to the agenda version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| Under enclosure section F-2, there are no maximum specifications for enclosure sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| no maximum heights from section F-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| As long as you stay within the required setbacks, your enclosure can cover all the remaining yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Nowhere in this ordinance does it state that enclosures must be limited to the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| This was mentioned by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| The two people who spoke in favor of this ordinance both stated backyard hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| but in this ordinance there is no such specification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Was this intentional or was it just an oversight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Section F, enclosures, and G, hen houses, to me there is nothing but general requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| which leaves enforcement to the discretion of animal control officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| I do not feel the burden of judgment as to the conditions of this ordinance should be placed on that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| Stricter guidelines with specific building requirements to ensure that the least impact on my property should be written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1947)|
| 0:32:36| The type of material used, the framing, construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| things such as raised wooden floors for the hen houses are examples of these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Under this ordinance as written, a hen house could be constructed from cardboard and meet the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| Waste storage removal and food storage and removal are addressed in the amended ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| that Councilman Woodhull did present and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| I do have some issues with the amended version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Under section E of the amended version, I see that the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| hen shall be kept as pets or is eliminated, and I don't know why the pets portion of this was eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| I know that at the stakeholders meetings when we talked about pets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| it brought into question the ordinance that exists now under animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| that no citizen is allowed to keep over four animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| So does this fall into that category as pets, animals, dogs, cats, or is this separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Is it considered separate and six can be written in and be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2018)|
| 0:34:01| I guess I'm not standing here to oppose the keeping of hens by my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| I'm here to ask that this privilege be allowed with rules to protect my right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| not to have my life adversely impacted by the abuse of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| I want to mention again particularly about the hen house enclosures and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| During the stakeholders meetings, we reviewed several examples of portable structures, built structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2063)|
| 0:34:34| and it seemed to me as though if we were to write into this ordinance these diagrams of these types of structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2074)|
| 0:34:42| even so far as to put photos, pictures, diagrams in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| it would make it not only easier for applicants to understand what is expected when submitting an application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| but those of us who will not have hen houses, we can look at this too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| and know that this is what it's supposed to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| This is what we understand should be next door and not something that might be abusive of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| We appreciate your consideration on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| I'm here representing Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| At the last board meeting, we voted to oppose the domestic chicken ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| and several reasons were cited for opposition, including concerns regarding chicken-borne illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| vermin that could potentially be a problem, larger predators that might be attracted to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| the fact that in the city homes are much closer together, especially in the older neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| and disposal of waste from the chickens as well as the impact of this waste on the stormwater system of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2153)|
| 0:36:00| the fact that most hens do not start to lay until after they're six to eight months of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| and the fact that breeders usually use extra light and must have exceptionally good conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| for the chickens to produce eggs every day or every other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Additionally, another important reason for opposition to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| is that most hens lay consistently for about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Then the egg quantity decreases considerably or even ceases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| What's to become of all these hens after they no longer lay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I understand also that there have already been over 26 complaints regarding chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| before this ordinance has already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Sometimes chickens need to be vaccinated for such things as fowl pox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| That disease is carried by mosquitoes, and it's a more serious problem in the southern regions of the United States where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| Who will monitor and verify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| If the birds get bird flu, then it must be reported to the county's Department of Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| Will the chicken owners know how to recognize the symptoms of these illnesses and other illnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2228)|
| 0:37:15| It can be difficult even to find an avian vet that specializes in chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| It seems with this ordinance we are sacrificing the welfare of the many for the benefit of the few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| Town Hall also voted to ask council that in the event of this ordinance passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| that all of Councilman Della Volpe's amendments be added to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| We thank you for your consideration for this important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Those speaking in favor have a two-minute rebuttal if one of you wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2263)|
| 0:37:56| Just a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| As far as hen houses in the front yard, let's see, it's under L, number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| They put this in the first time we went through this with animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| We talked about hen houses shall be located in compliance with city of Knoxville code of ordinances, zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| And right now, if you have a, there's some houses, say like somebody in south Knoxville had a house with no backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2296)|
| 0:38:25| but they had a really long side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| And they have, under zoning regulations right now, if they can have a shed in that side yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| they will be allowed to have a chicken coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| In front yards specifically, that regulation right there says no chicken coops in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| But in cases where they have a really long side yard, it might be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| The second one, as far as the education and the drawings, our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| the minute this passes today, we're going to morph from advocacy of this legislation to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| So if anybody wants diagrams or drawings or how-to lessons, it will all be online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| and possibly somebody will have classes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| So the education part, by legalizing this, is really going to help people to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| One last thing, as far as Fountain City's concerns, I guess I have to just end by saying there's been over 50 cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2360)|
| 0:39:29| There's another city almost every week passing chicken ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| In the last couple weeks, I've talked to a lot of city officials, and it's been an overwhelming success in these other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| And if you've taken the time, which I'm sure a lot of you have, to look into this and even call other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| you would agree with me that it has been a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Okay, we're going to return to discussion of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| I wanted to ask Chad a quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| How long do the hens lay eggs, and what does happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| What do you do with the hens after they're no longer producing eggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| It's my understanding that for about three years, they're on maximum production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| They'll max out at about one egg a day, but then they'll drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| and they'll continue to produce eggs until they're six years old or seven years old, until they die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| There won't be as many, but, you know, maybe one egg a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| And what really happens, when I've talked to other organizations in other cities, people get attached to the hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| So instead of getting rid of them or euthanizing them, often people keep them around for their entire life and continue to get a few eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2434)|
| 0:40:44| What do you say to this chicken-borne illnesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Well, we talked to – I will defer this to John New.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| He's a professor at the University of Tennessee on human-animal disease tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| He's based his whole career on this, and he came to one of our meetings with the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| and went through all the diseases one by one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| I'm not familiar with each one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| He could probably speak better, but he unequivocally said keeping a small number of hens in the city environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| will not detrimentally affect the health of humans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Mr. Herwinkel, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| I know that there are many people in the city – I don't know the number – who already have hens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| And I'm sure that's a hard number to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| But do you have any idea how many people already have hens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2504)|
| 0:41:52| I would say more than 10, less than – I don't know – less than 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2512)|
| 0:42:02| Something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman Woodall, do you have any idea on something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I had a couple quick questions for Mr. Donaldson and then I think Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Herwinkel talked about how we've got language in here and following the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| and there were questions raised about front yard and lot coverage, both of those for accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| My understanding is accessory buildings aren't allowed in the front yard at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Would there be any problems putting specific language in here to prohibit hen houses from the front yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| I mean, that wouldn't confuse anything, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| No, it would just reinforce the language that's already in the supplementary regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| And then the other question for you is the lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| What's our – I know I could find it if I was good at finding things in the zoning code, but that's why we have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| What is the lot coverage area for an accessory building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| The code speaks to building coverage collectively for all buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| and it generally is 30 percent of the lot in the residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| So if a house is small and a lot is big, we could get a big – so that might actually be something that's worth dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| And then, Ms. Poplin, the question I had related to Mr. DiLaVope's sort of language about a right to enter for inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| and for the emergencies, and I guess my question is, does that – again, does that exist with animal control now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| Do they – does animal control have a right to inspect my house for a dog, and if my dog is threatened to come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| Not in your home unless there's evidence that would allow them to go in based on a viewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| I mean, there's certain regulations that would apply to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| If the dog is outside and it's in plain sight, they would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| With it inside the home, there's other regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| And at a doghouse in the backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| They can look in a doghouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Yes, if it's within their view, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Would there be a problem with adding language like you suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| I mean, if we clarify it to say, I mean, that they have the right to inspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| that doesn't interfere with anything that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| It just clarifies it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Counselor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| I just wanted to go back to Mr. King and make sure that I understood what you said about the increase in the fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| because, you know, it's always easy to pick apart somebody else's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| and I appreciate the work that you all put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| But I do have a problem with the increase of the fee just because it's going to show somebody's serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| But if it does cover the bare cost of the inspection, then I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| And did I understand you to say that that would be the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| Yes, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Counselor DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Yeah, I have at least one question for Mr. Helwinkel, maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| But, Chad, if you could step up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| One is I understand a lot of folks get these chicks and they're a day or two old or whatever and they adopt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| I'm told that you can't sex a chicken at that age, so we're going to end up with some roosters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| And my question is what happens to those if you end up getting a half dozen chicks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| and you hope they're all hens but they're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Well, when you order them, you can request female chicks, and they'll do their darndest to try to sex them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| But once in a while there is a mistake and you will get a rooster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| And once they get up to crowing age, it would probably be a good idea to give that to somebody in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| And that's the benefit of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| We're networked with people in the county that have the facilities to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| You would place the homeless roosters, in essence, in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Actually, it's a 10-year plan to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| It takes a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| Another one was, and I don't know if Dr. New is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| but I looked on some websites when we were studying this on the first round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| and if you go to places like the Mayo Clinic and whatnot, they talk about the threat of histoplasmosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| as being most likely in the south to be either from entering bat caves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| or areas where there are confined chicken coops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| And I realize that if you have just a few in the backyard, that may be less of a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| than if you're in an industrial chicken coop where you're going in there and there's a lot of airborne viruses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| But the reality is that many are exposed and maybe very few get a disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| but it does talk about, in the literature, about people who are immune-compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| And I was thinking of Mr. Pierce's comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| what if the neighbor has someone who's going through chemotherapy or has an HIV-positive condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| or has something else that suppresses their immune system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| now they have their next-door neighbor conducting an activity that could, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| be and present a serious health threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| And I don't know how we deal with that, but it still is a concern to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| and I haven't heard anyone dispel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Histoplasmosis was a big concern of the Fountain City group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| and so I talked specifically to John New about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| If people are going about raising hens the proper way, it won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| It won't even grow in the hen coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| But let's say it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Let's say there is histoplasmosis within the coop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| It's virtually impossible for that to get from the coop and airborne into the neighbor's lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2867)|
| 0:47:56| If you were in the coop every day and down in the dirt or sweeping it up and smelling it right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| that there might be a possibility of transmission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Dr. John New said that, because I had never really heard of histoplasmosis before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2885)|
| 0:48:12| this whole chicken ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| Well, they say when you're immunosuppressed, instead of it being a localized thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| that your immune system kind of captures and encapsulates and gets rid of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| that it ends up spreading through your body and you get a severe illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| I mean, that's the danger, is that someone gets exposed who is not healthy enough to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| In Knox County, those big flocks of European starlings we have in the winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| that you see circling around downtown, he said that's one of the major sources of histoplasmosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| And it's everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| It's unconfined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| It's dropping under cars and under the trees, I guess, where they roost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| and also pigeons under overpasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| So it's part of our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| And having it in the coops, I think it's kind of if they go about raising the proper way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| it's not even going to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| I just wanted to call council's attention to a handout that Ms. Mitchell copied for me this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| It's relative to an e-mail exchange that I had with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| and the city reporter's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| and just wanted to thank the city staff both at the law department and the reporter's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| And this was a request of a citizen that I spoke with when I was out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| who recalled that there might have been a time in the past when chickens were legal in backyards in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| And so after some extensive research, the conclusion was that at least prior to 1945,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| chickens were legal in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| The only restriction is that they were not allowed to run at large upon the streets of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| And sometime between 1945 and 1962, the ordinance was revised to not allow chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| probably when the whole city code was overhauled in 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| It may have been when the animal control ordinances were looked at more specifically in 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| Whether or not that information is relevant to your decision tonight or not, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| But I thought that this citizen's inquiry was important to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| He remembered very specifically being able to go down to the market house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| and bring home not only a chicken that was dressed and plucked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| but also a live chicken that you could bring home for use of the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| So maybe all things old are new again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| Councilman Wilhelm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| I wanted to respond to Mr. Pierce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| Actually, Chad Helwinkel responded to one of your concerns about the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| and that I wanted to make clear that nothing was being slipped in at all, and you probably know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| And as Chad said, that the current ordinances actually deal with that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| If you recall in our discussions at our stakeholders meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| the animal control actually wanted more discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| So they wanted to be able to come in and identify whether or not something was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3068)|
| 0:51:16| habitable for the hens and shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| I feel like the language plays more to the discretion of animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| to shut down something that's unhealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| As far as protecting neighbors, this is complaint driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3091)|
| 0:51:39| And apparently, as Ms. Rowe said, there's 26 complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| So I guess it was not real clear in this city whether or not chickens are legal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| And so there were, I guess the complaining was around the fact that there are chickens out there that are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3110)|
| 0:51:59| And this ordinance is basically bringing forth the idea or the way in which you can have chickens legally and in a healthy way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3119)|
| 0:52:09| And it's calling into question those chickens that are being housed illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| So I actually feel like this ordinance is just being very clear about the way in which you can raise and have chickens in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3134)|
| 0:52:24| So as far as pets, that was taken out because we're not considering chickens pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3144)|
| 0:52:34| And that was a word that was, and you're right, we did have that conversation at the stakeholders meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| And I don't think it's really fair to consider the way in which we are organizing this ordinance as it relates to hens to refer to them as pets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3160)|
| 0:52:54| So we took that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| Now, as far as how to move forward, Mayor, I don't think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3180)|
| 0:53:10| I would like to, you know, to accept or to move to include the revisions that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3190)|
| 0:53:21| I understand that language that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| There are, right now there's a motion to amend that's been seconded on the, that's already on the floor, just as a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| So can we, like, include additional amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3219)|
| 0:53:51| For example, Councilman Palmer mentioned that she wanted to decrease the 60 days to 30 days for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3231)|
| 0:54:02| That was on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| If you're going to have a property for longer than 60 days, it makes perfect sense to change that to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3247)|
| 0:54:16| May I add that to my series of revisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| If your seconder will permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| Where is my seconder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Vice Mayor Becker, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| I would like to add that it actually is not necessary, but just out of a sense of comfort, we were going to include.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| Could you tell me what you wanted to see as far as front yard and also having access to the enclosures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| and coming in for animal control to come in and inspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Yeah, I mean, I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| We got some language, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| If we look at page four under, I guess it would be F4, whether that's a five or whether that's part of F4 doesn't concern me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3307)|
| 0:55:19| but it would say hen houses and enclosures shall be permitted only in backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| Now, that was the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| Can we just vote on the revisions that I've put forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| And then if other people want to bring forward some other amendments, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| We can do that. We can go ahead and right now vote to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| And if somebody wants to further amend, we can do that if you'd rather do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| Ms. Roddy, you look like you want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| We're tracking where we're going to do just that, to vote on the amendments that were presented on paper tonight that came out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| stakeholders group. Without the 30 days for Ms. Palmer, I mean, all the suggestions are valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| but maybe start with what we have in print in front of us and then continue to amend one at a time so that we can track where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3365)|
| 0:56:11| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| When you're saying what you have in print in front of you, would you include changing the male pronoun to the permittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| and the or to and that we discussed when he made his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| The kind of technical corrections that we made after that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| So the motion to amend is what was presented by Councilman Woodhull in addition to the technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| the grammatical and technical corrections that I guess were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| Just a question for, I guess, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| As we change this ordinance, does this in essence become a first reading of this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| In other words, we start changing the text in detail about where we're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| And at some point, do we cross a line where it's a substantive change and we have to read it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| I haven't done anything yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3431)|
| 0:57:19| What you mean is we're close to the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| Does everybody understand the motion to amend that's currently on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| Okay, you ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| All those in favor of amending, aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Okay, I heard eight ayes and no noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| Okay, now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| I guess, Ms. Palmer, if you wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| I was going to change, I have to find it again, to change 60 days in Section B-1 to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| And that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| I guess, further amend to change to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| Okay. Mr. DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| Okay. All right. Ready to vote on that second amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| Okay. All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Motion carries. Mr. DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| I think we described it, F-4 on page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3532)|
| 0:59:00| Now, whether it's F-4 or F-5, I'll leave that to Debbie in terms of numbering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| but it would state hen houses and enclosures shall be permitted only in backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3545)|
| 0:59:15| The second one would be the language that I described earlier about the animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| board and in consulting with Mr. Swanson, he thought we might want to put it up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Instead of at the very end, we would put it under the subsection B on page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| There's a permit required section. Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| And it would state the animal control board shall have the right to enter the permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| property during reasonable daylight hours to inspect the hen enclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| and condition of the animals in the enforcement of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| And then a second clause that says, and shall have the authority to enter the property at any time in case of an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| or health threat and to remove chickens from premises if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| That whole last part is the emergency powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| Let's take it one at a time is what Ms. Roddy is suggesting, so why don't we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| With regard to hen houses and enclosures being permitted only in the backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| I'll second that, the backyard part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| The motion is to amend for a third time to allow only in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| I actually have a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| I think this might be for Mr. Tom Reynolds, who is our chief building inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| Does that make a technical difference to say a difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| Mr. Henwinkel talked about somebody who has no backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| Do we have any situations where people have what would legally be not a backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| And I'm wondering whether the language, Mr. Velope, should be not in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| I don't know if that question quite makes sense, but do we have anybody who doesn't actually have a backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| There could be a situation where you wouldn't have a backyard, for example, a lot fronting on two streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| Two streets would be an issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| So, Mr. Velope, is that something you could live with and say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| We could say hen houses and enclosures shall not be permitted in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| That will leave the opportunity to argue the side yard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| Yes, because I think there's some funny things on how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| I think those are equivalents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| So it shall not be permitted in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I think we do actually have that legal issue that Mr. Reynolds said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| If you're on a corner lot, I think you have two front yards and no backyards, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Is that legally how we define that because of the way the language works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| I was referring to a lot that would run from one street to another street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| Then you would have two front yards and two side yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| But that would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| I have a yard very close to my home that runs through, and it has street on three sides, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| So it has three front yards, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| The house has a facade that would appear to be the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| but the backyard faces on a street, which makes it a front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| and the side yard is on a street, which makes it a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| But they don't occupy an entire city block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| so I guess they still have a side yard with their adjacent neighbor, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| So in that case, I guess the side yard would be the place where this person could have chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3742)|
| 1:02:29| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| We're just saying not in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| And front yard, we have to understand, if you're on a corner, it's anything that faces out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Now the motion is to amend for the third time to say not in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| All in favor, please vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| All those in favor of the third amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Now we have a motion triply amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Yes, and we're debating where this best fits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3780)|
| 1:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Let's go in at page three and right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Subsection B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| After the first sentence, we would have to insert the language that I have read to you, but I will read it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| So the first sentence reads, an annual permit is required for the keeping of any domestic chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| And then right there, we would insert the text, as a condition of issuance of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| the animal control board shall have the right to enter the permitted property during reasonable daylight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3824)|
| 1:03:51| to inspect the hen enclosure and condition of the animals in the enforcement of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| It could be ordinance, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| And shall have the authority to enter the property at any time in case of emergency or health threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3841)|
| 1:04:11| and to remove chickens from the premises if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| So that's a condition of the permit, and that's why council was suggesting that was a better place for it to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Ms. Rod, do you have a comment on that fourth amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Ms. Poplin, in terms of other animals, I know you were asked this a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| but the idea of animal control having this emergency authority to enter private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| and remove the owner's chickens feels pretty invasive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| Can you explain to me if the city has any laws similar to that already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| and what would be the severity of the situation that would require animal control to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| In emergency situations, they would have authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| If they see the emergency and can act on it, they would have that authority anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| If they do not see the potential violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| there would be a process by which to obtain an administrative search warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| By making this a condition of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| the permittee is actually agreeing up front to allow that access in all situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| not in the event of an emergency, but in any situation, to have access on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| So it gives very broad authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| And do our current ordinances give that broad of an authority for animals that are pets, like dogs or cats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| In emergency situations, it's different, but just to go and inspect a dog house or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3944)|
| 1:05:52| There has to be a reasonable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| If there's a complaint, there has to be a cause, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| I have trouble with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Well, and let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| We are doing something that is breaking with the state of our laws here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| in not having, in essence, farm animals in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| That's the way our code is written, and this statute and this ordinance is an exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3973)|
| 1:06:20| If we have a situation, I would think it would be very rare, where there's an avian flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| and the CDC is telling us something about creatures of this type being transmitters and grave danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| I think we don't want to sit there and write a letter and send them a letter saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| hey, we're going to have to come in and confiscate your chickens because we're going to have an epidemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| I think we need to have authority, and this authority by consent is a good way of balancing the notion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4000)|
| 1:06:48| that we're now introducing farm animals which do bring some risk of health and disease transmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| to have a counterbalance of if there is an emergency, we have ability to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| And I think that's healthy for the 180,000 residents who aren't here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| and who may or may not want chickens in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| but if we're going to allow this for the people who want to have this special circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| and to raise chickens and to have their eggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| we ought to be smart enough to protect the rest of the citizenry if there's an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| I'm assuming that that last part, the last clause, is very rarely exercised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| but if there's an emergency, I'd want to see them go right in and do what they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| Ms. Rodigan, I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Thank you, Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| And I certainly understand and concur with your concern about an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| and not having the language written down in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| It's a little bit harder to, I don't know, you sent me a copy and I left it at home, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| But it feels like your amendment goes, and to Ms. Poplin's response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| goes beyond the authority of an emergency situation in terms of granting broader powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| and that's the part that I'm feeling discomfort with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| not the ability for city officials to act in the case of an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| I certainly think that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I concur with Councilman Della Volpe that to go through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| let's suppose that someone is not as diligent as the people who are here in support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| and they have not abandoned, but they've just neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| If I'm the next-door neighbor, that would be somewhat of an emergency to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| and I would not be happy to wait for a period of time for a letter, an administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| or all these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I would like to have something done fairly soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| and the people who have contacted me in opposition to this feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Actually, the reason I second it is I thought it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| I think Ms. Roddy raises sort of an interesting question of what the definition of an emergency is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| and the interesting part is a massive outbreak of avian flu seems pretty logical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| like the house is on fire and we want to save the chicken seems pretty clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| but there's also sort of that sense of, well, the neighbor thinks that the chicken has avian flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| Is that an emergency, and where do we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| And sort of moving forward on this gets me back to the question that Mr. Swanson so deftly avoided earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| about has this moved at the current point to being back on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4166)|
| 1:09:38| Has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4178)|
| 1:09:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| All right, which gives you the advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| I'd be inclined to say to support this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| and to ask some of the brilliant legal minds that we have to think a little about how we sort of get the emergency clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4185)|
| 1:09:54| that it doesn't go down Ms. Roddy's road of being an infringement on our rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4194)|
| 1:10:02| which I could actually picture a nightmare scenario happening on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| But we've got time to work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| So I think I can support this, and we'll ask the sponsor of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| who actually is a lawyer, to work on that particular legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| And our able legal counsel here for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| And Ms. Poplin did want to clarify one thing real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| I did want to add there's already a general inspection section in our animal code, 5-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| which already sets forth sort of what I've explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| that it already allows animal control officers to have time to inspect with the consent of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| But then if there's not consent, it sets forth that the administrative warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| So it already says that for all animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| Is there anything about emergencies in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| I mean, I don't know if there's a dog flu, but is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| It's based on reasonable cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| But we've got time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| We've got two weeks to think on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| I think in looking at this language, and thank you to Councilman Dela Vuppi for showing me it written down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| you know, there's two halves to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| The second half, you know, after the word and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| and shall have the authority to enter the property at any time in case of emergency or health threat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| and remove the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| That part I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| It's the first half of this amendment that I'm uncomfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| and that's the part where this grants much broader rights to the Animal Control Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| than we have granted now under our current overriding animal ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| This grants the right to enter the permitted property at any time during reasonable daylight hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| to inspect the hen enclosure and the condition of the animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| That's much broader in terms of allowing city enforcement officials to come onto a person's property at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| to inspect the hen enclosures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And I think as a citizen there ought to be some process there where there's notification from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4317)|
| 1:12:05| that we would like to come do an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| We have reasonable cause per the kind of language that Ms. Poplin shared with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| that's already in the animal control ordinances at a higher level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| This grants, as Ms. Poplin said, very specific authority, if you are a keeper of hens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| for animal control to come onto your property without notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| And that makes me uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| The second half of Councilwoman Della Vopi's amendment regarding emergencies is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| but as long as they are together I will have to not support the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| We're going to go ahead and move to a vote on the fourth amendment then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| We better do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| The motion passes five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| Now we're back to the motion as quadruply amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| I have just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Charles, at what point did we cross the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| You crossed it with yours because of the difference in the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Oh, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| The other thing, this was not suggested by anybody on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| but the idea of lot coverage that Mr. Pierce raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| and we have language in this, Mr. Woodhull, and this is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| It says a minimum of, and I think I'm reading this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| a minimum of two square feet per hen shall be provided for hen houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| but there's not a maximum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| And I'm wondering if it would make sense, and I'm inclined to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| and Mr. Holwinkle, is there some level of saying, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| legitimately a hen house becomes too large when it passes some square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| footage, and whether that's something that's worth adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| and I will suggest that for your thinking cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| but not make a motion at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I don't think there's going to be a mass rush of a lot of people going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| and getting hens, but to be on the safe side with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| would it be appropriate or illegal or discriminatory if you put a limit on the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| permits issued per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| I'll ask that to, I guess, either Ms. Poplin or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| The question is, I guess the question is, can we put a limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| In limiting the number of permits that can be issued overall in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| I'd really have to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| That hasn't been posed thus far, and we've not researched that issue specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| In other situations where we have been able to limit the type of permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| and licenses we give, it's been by enabling legislation from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| and in this situation we're not relying on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| We're going through our home rule authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| and so I would actually need to look into that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| It probably may not be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| Like I said, I don't think it's going to be a mass thing of everybody having chickens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| but it's just something I was curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Can I ask just one thing, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| This one gentleman back here has been up three or four times and wants to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and I don't know if we can suspend the rules and let this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| If you would like to call on him, that's your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Yeah, I would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| The gentleman in the back, I know you've got something to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| and I want to hear what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| If you'd come down and give us your name and address and maybe be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| My name is Brian Vincent from 1940 Rosedale Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| and I had no intention of speaking tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| and I'd like to do this word-for-word, if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| This is a coincidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| I happen to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| All right, this is on the Fourth Amendment that you just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Persons and houses to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| and no warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| supported by oath and affirmation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| and particularly describing the place to be searched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| and the persons or things to be seized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| And I know I look like a hippie, but I was in the military for over four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| and I swore an oath, and I know all of you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| And how did you not think of this when you wrote that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| And I really appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| The second part, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| This law already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| You don't need to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| If people are being bad to chickens, it's your duty as a neighbor to report them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| But to take away people's rights is an insult to me and what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| The difference is that this does not authorize any officer to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| that has not been consented to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| It is part of the price of admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| If you want a permit to have hens in a city that goes against kind of people living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| in close quarters in an urban environment, then you have to apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| It's set up so that you realize that one of the conditions of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| in addition to having your hen house approved and paying the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| is that you consent to an inspection for health reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| And no one's going to be running around poking their nose in chicken coops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| but this is a brand-new venture for Knoxville, at least in the last 40 or 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4698)|
| 1:18:23| after we gave up having farm animals in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| And so it would be healthy to start this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| I suspect that the eight animal control people we have that can barely keep up with the dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| and cat issues and the raccoons breaking into the house are not going to be looking for extra work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| This is an opportunity to have the ability to make sure that we're doing this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| Now, Chad says we want to educate, and hopefully most people that take the education follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| If there are concerns, they ought to be able to go look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Should they knock on the door first? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| I mean, if someone wants to put that on there, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| But I think that we ought to step cautiously if we're going to jump into this river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| because we don't know where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| And so it's not a violation of the right if you consent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| In other words, I want the chicken, and I'm willing to pay the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| The price is you can come in my backyard and look at my hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| So it's not like someone's just breaking into a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| It's not doing that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| It's looking in a yard, and it's done by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| The consent is given on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| Now we're back to the motion as quadruply amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| And I would add, part of the question I asked about first reading, this does have to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| and clearly that's a controversial issue and I think will be talked about in two weeks when this comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| That's a good reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Now we're back to first reading of the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Vice Mayor, I just wanted to ask, when it comes to this, we're going to have some of our bright minds, legal minds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4797)|
| 1:20:05| someone said take a look at this because on one hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| Councilman Della Vopi says if you get a permit, you basically give consent for the city inspectors to come on your property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4809)|
| 1:20:18| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| You're basically giving consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I could see this really opening a door up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| You know, this is all complaint-based, and I can see this being abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| And I think we've got to be very careful, I agree with Councilman Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| that we really need to give this some serious consideration because this gets on some sacred grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4836)|
| 1:20:43| And so between the first and second reading, I hope we're going to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| and I guess it's going to go back to the MPC, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| And so there will be some vetting of this issue, and we can come to some conclusion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| And the other thing that Councilman Roddy brought up is we have other animal general inspection laws out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| that we need to consider, and they ought to coincide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Okay, now we're back to the motion as amended times four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| I heard eight ayes and zero noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| That is first reading for everybody's reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4886)|

| 1:23:02| Yeah, if I could just ask Chief Ivey over there, if you would tell us just a tad about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| We got the grant in 2009, and we're reaching out to our sister organizations to help share that under subcontracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| so that we do this important work of fighting Internet crimes against children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| That's the way I read it, and I'm trying to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5003)|

| 1:24:31| Mr. DelBocchi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Yeah, I guess this is Madeline's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| Can you tell us, we're taking the old school and going to rehab it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| so that we can get good housing for our seniors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| Is that what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Yes, this is a project that KCDC is doing that's funded partially by NSP dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| Remind me what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| A Neighborhood Stabilization Program, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| And this was something that you all approved previously when you approved this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| So these will be, in the old part of the school, 25 one-bedroom units, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| Art Cate from KCDC is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| He can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Plus they will also be building additional new units and a new facility adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| But this right here is the cooperation agreement in which HUD requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| whenever they add or delete properties from their inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| that the cooperative agreement between the city and KCDC be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| And so in this case, we're just amending the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| to include the fact that they now will have Eastport in their inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| And will this enable us, if we do get to tackle the Walter P. Taylor project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| like a HOPE VI project, to have more housing for people to move into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| Yes, my understanding is that this is part of their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| as they move seniors out of the Walter P. Taylor so that that can be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5148)|
| 1:25:54| They have to move them into other facilities, and this will help address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| So it's kind of the advanced planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5159)|

| 1:26:55| Maybe you can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| I thought we already had the dog park built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5216)|

| 1:27:43| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| I just have another dumb question, I suppose, since some of the others may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| Mr. King, it looked like this contract started at $81,000 based on the papers in the back of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| and I realize we're just doing the change order for the $42,000, but we've sort of tripled the contract price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| and I'm just curious, how did we get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| I mean, is that typical that we have to start with like a concept thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| and then amend to the actual execution during construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| This particular project, there's been a lot of public involvement necessitating several design changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5291)|
| 1:28:20| and that's the reason for the increased cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| We've had multiple public meetings, and there have been suggestions for what it would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5303)|
| 1:28:29| which side of the structure should the sidewalk be on, should there be a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| All those redesigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| So the project grew in the sense of where we started just working on like a concrete bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| and it became more of an enhancement, community enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Well, the look of the structure didn't so much change as did the side that we put the sidewalk on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5325)|
| 1:28:55| We looked at rebuilding the structure versus widening it and rehabilitating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5335)|
| 1:29:03| and, you know, all that just costs us time, effort, and money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| Mr. King, did the scope of the project increase as well in terms of the work done at Rotherwood Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| I mean, obviously, the project just got bigger, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Thank you for reminding me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5358)|

| 1:30:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| Mr. King, maybe you can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| It looks like the general contractor or maybe the owner of the development is pitching in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5445)|
| 1:30:53| and paying for the cost of the purchase and installation of the signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5453)|
| 1:30:57| Am I reading that part right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Are there other costs that the city will incur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| In other words, is this a piece of the project and there are other costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| Or where does this take us when we look through it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| The additional costs over time will be the maintenance of the traffic signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| and paying for the electricity to operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| But the physical work in the roadway and the installation of the pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| and lighting electronics will all be by Graham Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Do you know what the price of this project is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| I think it's around $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5490)|

| 1:31:56| Mr. Villalobbe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Mr. Mayor, I know we've talked about this at our budget hearings, these costs of health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| This, as I understand it, is the center where we get employees both physically checked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| and maybe avoiding illness and higher costs of sort of, you know, more tragic consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| Part of the wellness is preventive care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| And I'll let Gary, if you want to just give a kind of headline on that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| I hope Rebecca's listening since it's a headline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| This includes a lot of broad expanse, really, medical services, both occupational and medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| It includes treatment of workers' compensation injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| It includes annual fiscal exams for uniformed police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5559)|
| 1:32:46| There's quite a bit of occupational things here that as well as just medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| And we do the chronic illness prevention or maintenance, too, don't we, at this center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Yes, this is all included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| It's a pretty broad scope of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| And is that $47,000 a month for the five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| is that sort of tracking what the contract was costing us in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| It is a continuation of the same fees that we were already paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| I thought I'd do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Sometimes I drive the interstate and I see these billboards with a certain mayor's picture on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| and it kind of wakes me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| Actually, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Gary, don't walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| The National Magazine business insurance, you open it up, it has a big spread on Gary Eastis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| who apparently I'm just mentioning is a winner of a national award for the health insurance work we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| And since you're standing there in front of us already, I just wanted to say congratulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| and we appreciate the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And it's worth seeing what other people across the country think about the work we're doing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| What magazine is it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Hopefully everybody got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Thank you, and great job, Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| I don't think we voted yet, did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5648)|

| 1:34:11| Item 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute the City of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| Prudential Retirement Specimen Governmental 457B Plan Adoption Agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| as amended effective March 23, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| to allow regular part-time employees to participate in the city's deferred compensation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| to allow participants to contribute the value of their accumulated sick pay, vacation pay, and back pay to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5668)|
| 1:34:34| and to allow all participants, including former employees, to make rollover contributions to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5674)|
| 1:34:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| I guess this is for Larry, but it says no cost associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| What these folks are doing are, in essence, paying other savings into the plan so that it's administered under the same roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| Are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| This is similar to what one would call a 401K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| 457 applies to government employees, and this is all employee contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| And if they didn't contribute here, they would be paid in cash for their sick leave or whatever if they left the organization, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| Currently, under the provisions of the drop plan, once an individual drops, we pay out all accrued annual leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| and if they're eligible for sick leave compensation, then that would be paid in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| So they're just putting it into the savings plan if they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5735)|

| 1:36:23| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Do we have folks signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| We have two signed up to speak in favor, three against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| If I can, just set a little context for a discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| I know this is an issue we had a workshop at, and I was hoping to do some different things there that didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5794)|
| 1:36:41| It feels like there's a question here about is this a good idea and then what it actually says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5801)|
| 1:36:48| and I'd hope to have the what it says worked out before we talked about whether it's a good idea because it's easier when it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| But I want to suggest tonight we look at whether we want to continue talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| There's a lot of discussion in neighborhoods about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| and it might end up something very similar to what happened with the Hens in the City ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| where we can pass it on first reading, know that it's going to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| and might have to go back to first reading again so we've got time to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And I wanted to kind of say that to start the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Another supplement that Ms. Mitchell prepared for me this afternoon that everybody should have a copy of at their place is the current R4 regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5848)|
| 1:37:38| And I think it may have passed by some of the people that have been working on this that we already have an R4 zoning category in our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5858)|
| 1:37:48| And my understanding, Mr. Donaldson, is that what is proposed would completely, rather than blacklining what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| what is proposed would completely eliminate what we have had and replace it with what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| But absent action on the new R4 that has been discussed for quite some time, we would still have the old R4 remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5881)|
| 1:38:12| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5892)|
| 1:38:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| That's been in place for more than two decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| It's only been used on two parcels, but it is an urban mixed-use zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5896)|
| 1:38:23| And have there been problems with the current R4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| Have there been complaints about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| Not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| There's one parcel in Fort Sanders and one in Forth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| And so the intent of the substantial revision was to expand the use of R4 or to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5917)|
| 1:38:47| I guess I'm trying to get my arms around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| If there wasn't a problem with what we had before, then what instigated all of these changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5929)|
| 1:38:58| R4 was initiated to create a tool to implement zoning in accordance with the land use plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5938)|
| 1:39:06| that have been adopted through the general plan and sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| In those cases, which are calling for a mix of uses, for residential and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| It was decided to simply replace the existing R4 because it had been used so little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| and rather than have yet another zone district added to the menu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| to replace one that hadn't been used very much and keep the number of zone districts down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5970)|
| 1:39:40| But ultimately, not having compared the two versions side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| the new R4 that's in front of us tonight, is it fair to say it expands upon the old R4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| I guess one of the things I'm looking at is if for some reason council takes no action on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| it's not as though R4 is wiped off the face of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| I mean, we still have R4 in our code under its initial version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| I think the intent of the existing R4 district was to create opportunities for live-work structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| where someone could both live in the structure and work in the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| either in an office situation or an artist studio or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| The proposed R4 actually allows freestanding offices through a use-on-review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| or through the conversion of an existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| So where it's not a live-work, it's only a work, but it still looks like a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| The other piece, to go along with what Councilman Becker was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Vice Mayor Becker was saying in terms of framing our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| one of the things that was relevant to me that I learned today was that in the process of going through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6048)|
| 1:40:55| R4 never went to our Neighborhood Advisory Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| and that's probably because the Neighborhood Advisory Council is fairly recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| and this has been going on for two years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| but I think the Neighborhood Advisory Council has increasingly become an important voice of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6064)|
| 1:41:11| all across the city in a very inclusive manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| and their recommendations I think carry some weight with this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| And so as we go into this discussion, my line of thinking is that I might really want to hear that body evaluate this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6077)|
| 1:41:25| before we try to go any further with a firm vote and decision at this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| There's representation from all across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| and I think our Office of Neighborhoods has done an excellent job of forming that group and mentoring that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Ms. Twedy, I agree that the Neighborhood Advisory Group would probably benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| and we would certainly benefit from their advice and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| I did discuss this today with David Massey at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| and it will take probably more than one meeting of the Neighborhood Advisory Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| because they typically meet for 90 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| and for them to really understand and grasp and wrestle and deal with this as they would need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| it would require two meetings, and they do meet monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| What I'm talking about is we're looking at stretching the time out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Personally, I'm not opposed to that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| I just think that we need to really understand where we're going and what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| and I'm not sure that everyone is on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| Personally, sometimes I think I really understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| and then somebody else introduces something new, and I'm back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| And from this grin around the room here, I suspect other people have that same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Councilman Dela Vuppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Yes, well, I know some of us attended the workshop that we had on this very R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| and heard from a number of community group leaders who had spent that year and a half working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| and there was almost uniform, I won't say it was uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| but almost uniform kind of position that this R4 was damaging to neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| because while it's billed as a good, smooth transition from residential to office or some business use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6192)|
| 1:43:20| that it tends to make it easier to erode the boundaries of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| And I thought there was some pretty strong feelings expressed that this was going the wrong way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| and that we weren't depriving anyone of coming in and asking for an office zone if they wanted to on a particular track of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| but we were tending to encourage creep of commercial into neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| and there was some sincere concern expressed about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| I'm kind of wondering why we're moving forward on this, but I'll listen to the discussion as it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| And on the same note, too, of the neighborhood advisory, I mean, in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| and particularly in South Knoxville, there's been an umbrella group put together there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| that's been forming really about over the last year, but really took root| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| and grew wings in the last perhaps five to six months, and they're just now grasping this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| and I know that they've had a lot of, expressed a lot of concern with me that we not move forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| until they've really had a chance as well to vet this whole process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| And it sounds like going back to that neighborhood advisory group will give everybody plenty of time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| to have that process in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| So, you know, I was going to ask for a postponement based on, you know, what I'm hearing from my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| but I would certainly, I think that's an excellent idea that the two councilwomen have to send that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| to the neighborhood advisory group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| Yeah, let me, I guess two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| One, this is actually, it's not been a year and a half, Nick, it's been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| I mean, this has been going on for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| And I don't know if I object to let's send this to the neighborhood advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6310)|
| 1:45:17| I object to the idea of this body thinking somebody else is going to fix this somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| This has been going on for three years with people, five public meetings on this, lots of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| People have weighed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| I'm concerned because I don't think Daniel Brown talked earlier about we're not going to get a wave of people applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| for chickens, we're not going to get a wave of people asking for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| Even the zoning is going from residential to office that are currently happening for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| This is not a huge piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| And I don't think anybody else out there is going to fix this except us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| And I think the question we've got to answer first is the one that Mr. Delevaux raised, should this be fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6353)|
| 1:46:00| You know, that there is opposition from neighborhoods, there's support from neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| there are people who think it's a good idea and a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| And I think we've got to say, are we even going to bother talking about this more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| And I want to couch that in terms that doesn't let us think, well, yeah, we should bother with it because we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| to ask somebody else to deal with it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| I think this is something that the nine of us have got to roll up our sleeves and spend some time digging through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| And that's not necessarily going to be fun, but I think we've got to decide before that that it's going to be worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| I just wanted to say I attended the MPC workshop on this matter and, of course, our own city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| And we had thoughts from several neighborhood groups at both of those workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| And it appeared that most of the neighborhood groups represented were not in favor of this R4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6410)|
| 1:46:58| And I want to ask the question, if we go to the neighborhood advisory, at what point will it come back to the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6418)|
| 1:47:07| When will that come back to the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| I'll ask Ms. Palmer or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Probably Mr. Massey could better answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| David, just give your name and title real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| David Massey, Neighborhoods Coordinator of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6441)|
| 1:47:25| Well, I mean, I don't necessarily think it would take two months or two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6445)|
| 1:47:30| I mean, the advisory council could decide to meet more frequently within the time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| So if you wanted to ask the council to look into it, I'd be happy to put that in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| It's not my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| It's their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| I would just say that given the fact that so much work has been done on this by so many people, I think that what we ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6467)|
| 1:47:58| and I do know that there are members of the advisory council who would like the opportunity to delve into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| I'm not sure that what we're going to end up with, however, is going to be a unanimous decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6484)|
| 1:48:11| or a unanimous recommendation one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| I think it would reflect the fact that there are neighborhood organizations on both sides of this at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| There are some organizations that just want more time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| So there are very many detailed questions that a lot of neighborhood leaders have worked on this for a long time, as has MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6505)|
| 1:48:36| And then there are larger questions of, you know, is this the right ñ what is the problem that we're trying to fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6516)|
| 1:48:44| So, I mean, I'm happy to take it back, but they may come back with something totally different from what we're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6524)|
| 1:48:51| I mean, it may not be an up or down on R4 as it's currently written, but some other way of looking at this whole issue, if that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6531)|
| 1:49:02| Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| Having been to the Neighborhood Advisory Council, I can concur with what David is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| On two issues that came before the council, the vote was five to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| So, I mean, I think the split on two issues, one we considered tonight, one that may come down our paths in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6554)|
| 1:49:23| indicates that there is not necessarily going to be some kind of a beacon for us to follow in regard to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6563)|
| 1:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Councilman Whithall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Vice Mayor, are you frustrated because some of the ñ over the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6575)|
| 1:49:42| you felt like there was a lot of good productive work and there was ñ you were close to a product and then something happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6582)|
| 1:49:51| I mean, what ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Yeah, I'll say that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| I'm frustrated it's been three years and ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| I mean, you don't want to just pass anything because you've worked on it for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| But you felt like there was some good work and that you were ñ that this ñ the work that was being put into this R4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| was actually going to handle some issues, community issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| And then ñ so that's what you're frustrated about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| I also was going to try to address some of Vice Mayor Becker's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I think all of us heard at the workshop that there seemed to be unanimous opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| among the neighborhoods that attended that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| What has come to my attention in the time since that workshop until now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| is that uniformly in Councilman Pavlis's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| there seemed to be an unawareness that this was going on, despite the length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| And I don't think that's anybody's fault, but I heard from the historic Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| as well as a number of people from, as Mr. Pavlis said, the nascent South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| which represents almost every neighborhood in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| I mean, Old Sevier and Island Home and Colonial Village and et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6661)|
| 1:51:07| And they are either in favor of continued discussion or in favor of having more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| And I think this Council has never looked at a group and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| no, it's not deserving of more time to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| And so that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| And maybe the Neighborhood Advisory Council is a venue where it's an open public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| and anyone can come and listen to some back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| And those folks who've already decided that it's not workable can certainly speak in that venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| and then others who still have questions and there can be some cross-learning about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| But my intent is merely to provide more time, as frustrating as that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6701)|
| 1:51:48| Let me amplify a little more on Councilman Woodall's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| I think I'm also frustrated because I don't know how many times this has been on our agenda that we've postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6711)|
| 1:51:58| And at one of those, we got an e-mail from the neighborhoods that have been involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| And they said, here are all the changes we want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| And I'm frustrated because I looked at what they said and I said, great, I'll vote for all this, let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| And it feels like partly you said were we close and it felt like we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| But it also feels to me that I'm frustrated because while it's not a huge problem, it's one we are facing five times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6735)|
| 1:52:24| We're facing it in two weeks where somebody's proposing an office zone right across the street from Beaumont School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| And we've got to decide what to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| And it feels like every time this comes up, we're not making the right decision with an 01 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| We need something better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| And continuing to postpone just continues to say we either have the choice of denying somebody the right to make an investment in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6761)|
| 1:52:51| inner city distressed community or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| And I was at some of the early planning meetings three years ago where this idea was that somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6775)|
| 1:53:03| what was the problem we're trying to fix where people were talking about the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| I was at a situation where we had a pretty big fight over somebody who wanted an office zone on Dutch Valley three and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| It was one of the things that led to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| So, yeah, this feels like a very long time to try and work out something that doesn't seem that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| So, and, you know, I'm sorry to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6804)|
| 1:53:26| And, you know, I'm glad somebody said why are you frustrated because it's like, oh, yeah, I'm frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| And that's probably good to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6816)|
| 1:53:37| Just out of curiosity, was the current R4 zone suggested as an application in the situation in Beaumont or the situation on Dutch Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| I don't recall the situation on Dutch Valley because it was not expansive enough to apply in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I mean, my sense of the current R4 is it's designed for sort of a studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6831)|
| 1:53:59| You know, my sense is, and Mr. Donaldson, correct me, I have it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| I've not looked at it much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| That it's a very different animal than a house that is being used as an office that is next to a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| that it's not designed for that issue, that it's a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| It was not considered for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| Mr. Donaldson, is the current R4 is limited to a live-work situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| It cannot be a work only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| It cannot be an office only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| You can have a studio for the arts as a freestanding structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6875)|
| 1:54:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| But in looking at it, I mean, you can have a professional office of some kind, a law office or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| but then you also have to live there under the current R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| I still have folks signed up to speak, but I'm going to call on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| Yeah, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| I'm sure my colleagues have heard from numerous areas around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| not only south Knoxville but other areas, who would like to see an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| and see some further discussion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| And it has gone on for three years, and there's a lot of things that have gone on for numerous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| This has been a very curious journey, and I'd like to see it continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6915)|
| 1:55:22| because I'm sure the community will come to some conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I do not agree totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100727?start=6926)|
