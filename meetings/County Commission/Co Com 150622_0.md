| 0:02:53| and then be able to give your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| So at this time, I'll call Captain Wolfie May to come and testify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=175)|

| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| On May 19, 2015, I sent a couple of underage minors into the Gondolier 6951 Maynardville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| and they purchased two mugs of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=199)|
| 0:03:30| You have heard the allegations placed against you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Well, I do admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| I'm not going to try to explain myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| She was a college student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| She was trying to make her way through college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| She did ID the first individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| He was overage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| She checked the second ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| He was born the same year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| She didn't check the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| I mean, we all make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| Like I said, I'm not going to try to explain myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| I mean, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| This is our first priority in all our meetings with employees, mandatory meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| As you all know, this is my first offense in nine years since I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Captain, were both individuals underage or one individual underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Both, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| There were two citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=269)|

| 0:04:32| One was old enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| The second was born the same day, same year, I'm sorry, same year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| She just didn't check the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Did the person old enough buy the alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| The first one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| The first individual, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| One was 40 and one was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| That's the only two people that were with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| No, it was three, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| Here's my mic, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| How many people did you send in, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| One adult, two minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Make a motion for a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension, whichever is your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Sir, you have the option of a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| I'll just take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=338)|

| 0:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Double Dogs, Chow House, 10639 Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Double Dogs, Tennessee, LLC, owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Good afternoon, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| My name is Nate Evans with Bernstein's Terry McAdams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| and I'm here on behalf of Double Dogs as are John Morrison and Ken Howron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| We'll cede the floor, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Mr. May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| On May 19, 2015, I sent underage in Double Dogs, 10639 Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=378)|
| 0:06:27| and purchased one bottle of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=387)|
| 0:06:37| Ladies and gentlemen, I am a lawyer, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| And as a lawyer, I was thinking I was going to come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| and show some video and make a big case out of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| but I think that you all would appreciate it if I kept my remarks brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| I think that I've talked to Wolfie prior to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and I think that he would substantiate what I'm about to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| and that is on the dating question, two young ladies went into Double Dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| One was just a week or two weeks shy of her 21st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| The other one was 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| And what ended up happening is the 18-year-old ended up getting served beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| and the girl who was just shy of 21 did not get beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| You might ask, how did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| The server recognized, took both IDs, showed them to her manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| and I think that in the confusion, they looked at the date, the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and the day of the one license and transposed it onto the year of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| And so they ended up believing that the younger girl was, in fact, of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| It was a truly honest mistake, and we'd ask for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| in perhaps reducing the fine and or suspension amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| Oh, and I also, just to be clear, Your Honor, Double Dogs has taken significant action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| This is a big priority for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| ABC, all their servers are ABC accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| And in addition to that, now as a result of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| they put stickers on each one of their server forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| so that each one of their servers can know the exact date and year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| without having to look too hard or have to remember what the date and year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| in terms of when someone is eligible to purchase alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| Do you not have the register that checks the ID on the cash register?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=507)|
| 0:08:37| It's a restaurant, not a grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, it's a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| Because it's a restaurant, that is somewhat unfeasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| considering that this is a sit-down restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| and the servers are going out to the tables and checking IDs and then going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| It's a little bit different than maybe a club or a grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| where that would be very practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| It's been a long time since I've been anywhere close to the age of underage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| but do not the IDs have a mark on them that distinguishes you're underage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| The red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| The red stripe tells exactly when they turned 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| and I did it for them before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| So if you look at that red stripe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| the only mistake you can make is refusing to serve someone who has since turned 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| It will still say under 21 until June 6, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Once it says past that, then they're legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| One question for Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| In terms of percentages, it looks like we went to more on-premise locations this time, at least the first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| How have those numbers been as far as pass-fail rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| The May, we checked 13 places and cited six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| And a couple of them were cited twice because there was two underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Still a pretty high percentage as the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| So I guess my concern, as Commissioner Smith said, you don't have to take it to the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| It says under 21 until June 22, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| So I don't buy the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| And I'll also say, you know, if you're looking at this statistically, you know, to confuse those dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=642)|
| 0:10:51| and it happened to be the one that Wolfie happened to send in on that particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| and I'm, you know, just no disrespect intended, but I don't buy that as a feasible excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| I mean, we're talking about underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| We're talking about the stuff that they show on the videos and they show on the 6 o'clock news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| and, you know, the horrific accident, and a lot of them are right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| There's something magical that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| They have these laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| As you're a lawyer, they have these laws for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| So to kind of say, well, I mean, I'm kind of sensing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Well, you know, they kind of almost was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| Close counts and horseshoes, and I disagree with that philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=695)|
| 0:11:42| All right. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| I move that we find the $1,000 or 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| Motion is for $1,000 in 30 days or a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Motion is second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| You have seven days to remit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Very well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I want to take just a second of privilege here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Last two months ago, this beer board had a substantial number, 16 or 17 violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=730)|
| 0:12:19| and we kind of, over the last four or five years, have heard the excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| We've heard the excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| We've misread the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| That red stripe has been on there since I was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| And so we've misread the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And so the $500 fine that was previously handed out on the first offense was really just kind of ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| And so two or three months ago we decided to up the ante a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| because obviously people weren't listening and we're still hitting 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| so it's still a problem, still an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Would you accept the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Fine or suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Seven days to remit to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| And I certainly understand the commission's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| but I would simply say that there are honest mistakes, of course, that do happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| and that's what we believe happened in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| And we're working everything to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| 5D, the Sushi Spot 7535 Barnett Way, the Sushi Spot Incorporated owner, first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=792)|

| 0:13:24| Robin Reed, 7535 Barnett Way, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| On May 19, 2015, sent two underage into Sushi Spot, 7535 Barnett Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=817)|
| 0:13:48| and they purchased two bottles, 12-ounce Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| So they both bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=835)|
| 0:14:07| You heard the allegations that were stated against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| I affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| At this time, you have an opportunity to tell this board your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| You just made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Terry Hill came in with ABC and did an ID class for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| so we're aware of the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| I was not aware of that either, but we are now making sure they do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and we also are writing the dates down that everyone is born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Move for a $1,000 fine or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Let me get her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| Do you want that 30-day suspension or $1,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| We'll take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| You have seven days to remit that to the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| This is the second one today where there have been two offenses on the same stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Is that counted as one offense or two offenses, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| It's one charge when it comes to us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Now, it goes to court, it's two citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| I think it's one event, and I think it would be difficult for us to justify anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=919)|
| 0:15:28| My opinion, purely my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| A thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=935)|

| 0:16:04| Just a second, Captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| On May 19, 2015, sent two underage into Don Gallo's 980 Emory Road with two bottles of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=971)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| You've heard the allegations before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| Do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=991)|

| 0:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| This is your opportunity to give your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| I was not at the store at the time, but I was with my manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| She's a server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| She's been with us for five years, and she made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| So she's basically here to just look at the IDs and just sell the beer to the minors, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1024)|

| 0:17:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| This has been difficult on me because we've got double dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| Oh, I need your choice, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| The fine or the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| The fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Double Dog, Sushi Spot, and Don Gallo are all places that we frequent as a family, so it's kind of disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| 5F is actually inside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| Is that correct, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Unknowing to any of us, beer board or law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| I think because they had their liquor license long before ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| So I think they were annexed for a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| You made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| I need a motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| Lack of jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| The reason for that is he doesn't hold a beer permit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| We can't delegate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| Come over to the podium, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| So in regards to the manager who was cited, does that citation stand legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| The citation stands legal because it's still sale of an alcoholic beverage inside the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| They've got jurisdiction both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| So at this point, the manager has paid his citation already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| We're going to be suspending surrendering our beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| No, we've chosen to because we've only done $900 worth of sales in beer the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| So we don't see worthy of even having a city permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| So moving forward with the manager, he was required to take some ABC classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Would that still be required of him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| Only if he wants to hold a permit, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| It depends what kind of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| If you still have the ABC and you're still doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| We don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| The only thing we serve there is beer, but we're going to surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| We're not even going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| I've got my license for the county to surrender today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| And we're not going to apply for a beer permit through the city because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| we've done $986 in beer sales the entire year to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| And so we just really don't want the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Wolfie, you were going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| The clerk that was cited, he'll have to follow whatever goes through the Sessions court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| He says he already paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| But I think he has satisfied the statutory state issues with Sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1180)|
| 0:19:46| The question was, does he need to, what was your question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Well, he paid his citation fee, which was $214.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| He's paid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| But they also required him to go to a beer service class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| But if we're not going to serve beer, I don't know who to follow up with that to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Sessions clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| The judge's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| For the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| That's part of his probation is to attend the school, whether he ever goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| I just wanted to know what he had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| I wasn't sure at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| That's part of a court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I would fulfill the court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Can we get your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1225)|

| 0:25:22| What's the effective date of the sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1522)|

| 0:27:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Sir, you got the option of a 30-day suspension or a $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1656)|

| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| I guess you all have to get with Captain May there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| All of you owners who are still here or operators, were you all aware of the little red strip on the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Our server was just a neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| I was just thinking maybe if we need to have Wolfie hand one out every time we have one up here so they can take it back and show them what they look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Let's bring one and put it on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Our servers were just a neglect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| They didn't follow procedure policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| They get it in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| If they go to the school and attend the school, they get it in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Sometimes it doesn't stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| We've even given them the books from the beer distributor that has an example of all 50 state licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1698)|
| 0:28:27| They failed to do their job and that's why their employment was terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| I even teach TIPS training to our servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| So they're just not following the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| That's all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Let's move on to applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| We've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Let me hold on just a second, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| Tokyo Mandarin 5A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Did Tokyo Mandarin come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Is there a motion to move that to next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Motion to second to move to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Mr. Lautrec, will you send them a letter stating that they failed to show that we'll operate in their absentia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| How does that work, Brad, being new on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| We'll do what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| We did it to the Oak Ridge Raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| No, I mean, they can't sell until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Well, they can sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| They've still got a current license, but we'll give them one shot to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| And then we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| And then we'll either vote to suspend them or we can do whatever we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Yeah, just quickly tell me, how are they notified once they've been cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| You walk in and tell them right then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| They're put on the agenda for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I think the clerk's office makes contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| No, he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| We send a letter to their home address, to the business address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and Captain May posts it at the business on the either front door or front window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I don't understand the excuse for not being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| I tell them not to take the sign down until after tonight's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| I post on every place that's either applying for an application or that we have cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| And I would like to say on all these people that we got, probably about 80% of them never checked IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Yeah, I think it's just traditionally we've always set aside a zoning or a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| We've always just put them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| We don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| We'd have to redo the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Well, you know, the thing that was disturbing to me today is what you said, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| I think I've been in every one of these restaurants with my kids in the past or grandkids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1846)|
| 0:30:56| and it's a little disturbing to me because these are the places I would have thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| you're just not going to have any problem, and yet it's not just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| It's some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| It's two of the same type of restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| It's a little unsettling for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| It's difficult to deal with the human element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Question for Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| So with this particular vendor that didn't show today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| would it be your expectation that that letter would stay up at their business until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| or would you give them another date and go and repost it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| I'll take the next letter to repost for next month and put it on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| and we'll talk to someone, management or owner, about not showing up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Yes, sorry, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| On that same line, have you been out there to see if the sign is still up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| or does anybody ever take that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Are you talking about the raceway where they're suspended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| Out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Tokyo Mandarin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Tokyo Mandarin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Is it still up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| I'll put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| I don't go back and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| These are consequences if they take it down is what I guess I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Not any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| You all would have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Let's move on to applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=1943)|

| 0:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| We've been acquiring certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2368)|

| 0:39:30| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| This is Special Agent Derek Dalton with Tennessee ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2374)|
| 0:39:45| And on this Don Jose, we bought liquor on 4-7-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2385)|
| 0:39:55| I'll let him explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Officer, you were here at the time of the oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| You were here, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| I was, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| On April 7, 2015, approximately 8.08 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| Knox County Sheriff's Office employees, accompanied by a confidential informant age 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| was served a margarita after the server checked identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| That server subsequently was cited into Knox County General Sessions Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| and a regulatory citation was given on part of Don Jose Mexican Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2435)|
| 0:40:47| Has the ABC adjudicated that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| In addition to that, that was on 4-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| The citation was paid on 4-10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| But one thing that I think would be honest to say for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2459)|
| 0:41:07| a new application was submitted to us on March 24, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2467)|
| 0:41:20| by the partner, Miss Felicia or Leticia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| I'm trying to get the names right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2489)|
| 0:41:48| That license was temporarily granted, and then a letter was sent out to San Gabriel Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2508)|
| 0:41:58| of a denial based upon TCA 458-103, which deferred action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| and listed Miss Hernandez as not a qualified alien as defined in state and federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2525)|
| 0:42:14| I'll answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| So is there a liquor license currently there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Is there a liquor license at the business now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Are they selling liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| It is my understanding that they are, and I have a liquor license that shows they're valid until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| I tried prior to this meeting to get confirmation for that particular question, and I haven't at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| Basically, the application for the change of ownership was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| A change of ownership was going from Miss Hernandez or from Miss Ingrid to Miss Hernandez?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2564)|
| 0:42:55| No, let me find that so we have clarity as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| Change of ownership was going from Francisco Hernandez and Guadalupe Hernandez to Leticia Hernandez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| which I understand is apparently a partner to this young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Ma'am, does, and I didn't get your last name, Ingrid, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Benelis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Ms. Benelis, how much of the partnership does she own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| Sixty percent of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Sixty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Yes, and I'm honestly completely blank now because I didn't know anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| It's like I have the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| I've been talking with Virginia at the ABC on Knoxville, and I didn't know she got a letter about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| So I'm really sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| I'm sure I shouldn't be here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Well, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I don't think we can grant a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| I need to take care of that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| I'm sorry I take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Do you want to defer this for 60 or 30 or 60 days, or how do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Because if we throw it out, you'll have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| I will do whatever you tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| I really don't know this, and I'm really sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| I make a motion that we postpone this for 60 days, and it gives her time to clear this all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| Well, and here's, he's made a motion to postpone it 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| If you get it done in the next 20 days and you want to, if you get it done in time to be on the next agenda, you can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| Is that fair, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I guess we should say up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| You just let us know when you get it cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| I will, and I'm really sorry I take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| I'm glad I came in so I can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Now we need to hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| I have a question, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| On the transfer, you mentioned two, or he mentioned two Hernandez's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| What relation are they to a teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| They were brothers, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| And they were brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| And actually, Leticia is Francisco's wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| And I really don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| As a marriage, they decide to put everything under her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| We've got a motion on the floor to suspend or to postpone up to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| And if she gets everything in order, she can come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2725)|

| 0:45:31| So get it squared away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| And if you can get on the next agenda, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| If not, you can try 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| Is there anything else coming before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| We're adjourned until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2740)|

| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| We're going to go ahead and call for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| I do have some people that have signed up to speak on Resolution 203, so we'll hold those off until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| Is there anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| One person, Xavier Presley, has signed up, but I don't see Xavier here, so we'll hold up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| Is there anybody else in public forum that wants to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| And you've got the option to speak at the time of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| So I have two for Resolution 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2819)|
| 0:47:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| The honoraries, 101 has been deferred, and 102 is going to be deferred another month because Mr. Burroughs is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2831)|
| 0:47:22| And Commissioner McKenzie's was deferred until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| I'd like to ask, is there anyone here representing Honor Air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| I had talked to the people with Honor Air this past week and thought they may be here because I have a check from discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2853)|
| 0:47:44| Really the thing that I'd like to say to my fellow commissioners is if you have any balance in your discretionary fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2864)|
| 0:47:52| I would request that you consider a contribution to Honor Air to transport either a World War II vet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2872)|
| 0:48:01| or an in-country Vietnam era veteran to visit the memorials in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2889)|

| 0:48:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| For the past 18 months, the gentleman that I'm going to introduce has had a dramatic impact on the lives of young men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2896)|
| 0:48:24| and women not only in my district but also that of Knox County, including my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| And at this time, I'd like to introduce Campus Pastor Jay Smith from the First Baptist Church of Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| It's such an honor to be here and represent our community and our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Something I've been thinking about, we're kind of in the same role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| There's a lot of similarities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| You serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| I serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| And much of us who are in leadership from the community serve in some capacity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| And if you're with me, you understand how hard that is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| You make a decision and people say, why this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| Why that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| But I want to give you some encouragement today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| And it's something we all have heard before, but God loved the world so much that he gave his only son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| that whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| And the next verse is of utmost importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| But God didn't send his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| And in that, I find hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| When I look in the world and I say there is no hope, there absolutely is hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| I want to read an excerpt to you of one of my favorite guys, Dwight L. Moody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| It says, Dwight L. Moody was a poor, educated shoe salesman who felt the call of God to preach the gospel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| While visiting the British Isles, Moody attended an all-night prayer meeting with some friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| The next morning, his friend, Henry Varley, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| The world has yet to see what God will do with a man fully consecrated to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| Moody was deeply moved by those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Later, he listened to the famous pastor, Charles Spurgeon, preaching in his church in London.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| Moody's biographer described how he responded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| The world has yet to see, with and for and through and in, a man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| Varley meant any man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Varley didn't say that he had to be educated or brilliant or anything else, just a man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| Well, by the Holy Spirit in him, Moody said that I, I could be one of those men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| And then suddenly in that high gallery, he saw something he never realized before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| It was Mr. Spurgeon, but after all, he wasn't doing that work, it was God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| And if God could use Mr. Spurgeon, why could he not use the rest of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| And why should we not all just lay ourselves at the Master's feet and say to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Send me, here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| And I will say the same to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| You know, Jesus' call to his disciples when they were saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| Who among us is going to be the greatest, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| He said, The greatest among you is a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| The greatest among you is a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| So often I want to buck for position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| I want to, I want to climb my way to prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I want to climb my way to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| But Jesus says, No, the greatest among you is going to be a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| Have you ever thought that the darling of heaven steps off of a throne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| and comes in the form of man, the humility that that would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| But we're called into that same, same place of serving our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| So are you discouraged today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| I would say find hope in Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Find hope in the sacrifice that he took it to the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Why do I deserve anything different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| I want to go to that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| I want to find encouragement today knowing that Christ set the example for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| in all love, all humility, all hope, to say, You're not alone today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| I've gone to the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Come with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| And he calls us into that place to reach our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| He said, The greatest among you is a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| So I call all of us to that place today to serve our communities without compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| to go to a place that we have not even gone to the cross yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| Jesus went all the way to a cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| And yet in my self-centeredness I often say, Why do I deserve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Why me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| In reality, I say, Oh, what an honor today to serve today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| because it's the truth of the gospel that says that you have been appointed by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| Leadership has been given by God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| You would not sit here if it weren't for his authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| So today I rest on that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And I call us all into let's serve our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| And are you discouraged today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Don't be discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Be encouraged because the greatest among you is a servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| As you serve your communities, I want to say blessings on you guys for what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| and for how you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| And I would call all of us into that same call of serving our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| and to love them as Christ loved me and set the example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| If I could pray for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| God, thank you so much for how you set the example for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| We want to humble ourselves this day and say, Apart from you, we are nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| Apart from your guidance, we are nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Would you lead us into whatever you have for us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| And as you set the example for us, may we then in turn show that love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| show that humility, show that servant-hearted that you showed us to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| God, help us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| With your grace, we'll accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| I pray in the name above all names, Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=3215)|

| 1:16:20| and was it done properly in the order it was to be done in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Was the TCA codes violated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| If there were, what is the legality on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| And I'm kind of at a point to where this makes the second one in less than three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4591)|
| 1:16:40| that we've had to go back where the school board has had to redo the motion to get it in proper form that comes to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4600)|
| 1:16:48| And where can we do anything to say let's follow the TCA code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4608)|
| 1:16:58| I mean, how do we get around this to where we have to redo something when a process or a law or a form that we use is broken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4618)|
| 1:17:08| So I'm just going to throw that out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| I understand we already accepted funds and went through it before it was even voted on by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| Mr. Lautrecker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| Well, the issue before the board right now is a resolution that has been approved by the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| It is before you in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| It even states within it that it is a contract that is what we refer to as now for then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| and that it is here to be a corrective action by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| All that being said, the issue before this board is whether or not you approve the Broad contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| The Broad contract has been sent here as approved by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| This is not a consent item because it does require matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| That's the only reason it's not on consent under the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| So it's a policy issue for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Anything beyond that, in terms of what I was hearing Commissioner Bessler state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| are all issues that are before the Board of Education to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| It's their, they have total control over management and control of the operation of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| And that's by statute as well as by the consent agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| That being said, any of the issues related to operation of the schools belongs to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4711)|
| 1:18:39| The only thing before you is a matching grant to be approved for or not be approved for by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| What are the, what if it's not approved by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| What's the, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Okay, if it's not approved by this body, then the grant is rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Then the Board of Education will have to then contact the grantor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and they'll have to work out something with the grantor and see where it goes from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| There's not a clear cut answer, yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| It's still back to the people who are wanting to grant the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| The original contract has been totally revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| and the grantor is in total agreement with all the issues that have been revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| to bring it into legal form before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| The Board of Education has debated the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| concerning the issues that have actually been discussed here or questioned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| The Board of Education has also asked for a policy update on their DM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| which is the policy of the board whereby they accept grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| and they'll have that action on their body I think at their next board meeting if I recall correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| or maybe the one after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| I don't really know when it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So once again, all of the issues of concern have been addressed by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4793)|
| 1:20:01| as it relates to the contract before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| Anything else related to that, the legalities, illegalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| or things that are up to the Board of Education and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4807)|
| 1:20:13| and how they want to deal with any issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| and I don't think those issues are before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| All right, we have two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Is there any discussion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| We have two people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| Mr. Robert Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Sir, if you'll give us your name and address for the record, you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| My name is Robert Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| I live at 1735 Blackwood Drive, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| I'm speaking to you today on the matter of Resolution 203,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| the retroactive approval of a $29,700 grant from the Broad Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| which requires matching taxpayer funds in the amount of approximately $90,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4851)|
| 1:20:57| in order to employ a Broad resident within KCS as part of the Broad residency program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| This matching funds grant was previously accepted unilaterally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| on the part of Superintendent McIntyre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| bypassing both the Board of Education and the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| This is in direct violation of Tennessee Code Annotated 492115C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| as well as KCS BOE Policy DM entitled Grants Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| To knowingly and willfully withhold financial information from this funding body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| is a Class E felony in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| During 1991, in Tennessee Supreme Court case Estep v. Peters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| an appointed school superintendent was ousted from office for a similar offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| setting a clear precedent for the interpretation of this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| Nonetheless, despite the counsel of Knox County's law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| which distinctly stated that the terms of the grant were illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| five of nine members of our Board of Education nonetheless voted for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| to be approved in an ex facto manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| And now the final decision is in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| I respectfully request this body vote no on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| The handling of this grant on the part of the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| has been highly suspect and anything but forthright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| Dr. McIntyre stated to the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| that he acted in good faith in his acceptance of this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| and that his unilateral acceptance of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| in violation of both state law and BOE policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| was simply an oversight, a misunderstanding, or a matter of semantics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| Dr. McIntyre has, however, correctly followed the exact same procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| for other matching funds grants from other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| What should make this grant from the Broad Center any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| Consider the fact that at the initial time this grant should have been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| to the Board of Education in fall 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| the superintendent faced a likely 5-4 vote against its approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| due to an interim seat being temporarily held in the second district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| by BOE member John Fugate, who had voiced opposition to many of his initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| Mr. Fugate was appointed on August 25, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| The Broad grant letter was dated September 19, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| The superintendent unilaterally signed the grant on September 12, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| Consider also the superintendent's own relationship with the Broad Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| part of the larger Broad Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| Dr. McIntyre himself is a graduate of the Broad Superintendent's Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and since his arrival here, he has effectively created a pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| placing one Broad-affiliated individual after another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| into specially created, high-paying central office positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| Prior to their installation in our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| these Broad fellows held executive positions at Procter & Gamble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| Wachovia Bank, Bank of America, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Genzyme Corporation, and Taco Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| Not an educator among them, not a single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Yet their continued presence has cost our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| over a half million dollars and counting in salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| How can our superintendent continue to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| and illegally fill these positions while at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| cutting or eliminating programs and teaching staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| Cuts that directly affect the children in our classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| as part of ongoing reductions in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| How many teaching positions could instead be funded with these salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| How many teaching assistants? How many school counselors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| As a former KCS teacher, I remain concerned with the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| in which KCS's current leadership is taking our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| A leadership which apparently behaves as if it is above the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| when it suits their ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| A leadership that sets a poor example for our students and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| As a parent, I can see no need for the fancifully titled positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| created for these Broad fellows when my own kids are being subjected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| to ever-increasing class sizes, excessive testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5080)|
| 1:24:44| and a revolving door of teachers and principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| My kids need teachers who are valued and supported by their administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| far more than they need a Director of Human Capital Strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| a Deputy Accountability Officer, or a Director of Planning and Improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| occupying some office downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| Finally, as a taxpayer, I resent seeing tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| illegally funneled away from classrooms and directed toward nebulous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| central office positions created to serve an outside agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| rather than supporting our students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Commissioners, each of you has sworn an oath to defend the state constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| and the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| Five members of our Board of Education, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| appear to be primarily concerned with defending the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Please do not follow in their footsteps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Please write this wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Please vote no on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Any questions for Mr. Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| Next is Jennifer Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| Ms. Owen, if you could give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| I'm Jennifer Owen, 2217 Fair Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| You and I and the public are well aware that the Knox County Director of Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| accepted a matching grant from the Broad Foundation without presenting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| without having it voted on, by either the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| or by county commission, this body, as required by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| That illegal act remained hidden, not for a few days or a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| but for an entire year, which is conveniently the length of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Whether this is an impropriety, a crime against government, a felony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| or something else really depends on whether that act was performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| willingly and knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Since many such contracts have been handled correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| including previous grants with the Broad Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| which county commission approved as far back as August 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| it seems quite clear that this was not a failure to understand the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| This was done willingly and knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| Rather than dealing with this illegal grant acceptance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| five members of our Board of Education have chosen to become complicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| by attempting to cure the problem with a vote to approve the grant retroactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| I doubt that the public expected our elected Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| to abdicate their authority and allow one employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| to have such sweeping, unchecked, and reckless power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| It is my hope that our county commissioners realize the gravity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| of not only allowing but encouraging illegal activity to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| while the public looks on helplessly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| This is not a problem that needs to be cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| It needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| Several weeks ago, I spoke to our Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| regarding the possibility of ouster as a corrective measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| However, this action should not be the responsibility of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| After all, we have already done our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| in voting for candidates we believed in and trusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| to ensure that the laws are carried out ethically and responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| Additionally, we have a tax-supported office of the district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| that should be investigating and correcting this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| According to the University of Tennessee County Technical Assistance Service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| ouster proceedings may be instituted by the attorney general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| district attorney general, or county attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| either on their own initiative or after a complaint has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| Though I realize that a group of 10 citizens may also combine their personal funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| to retain an attorney and begin the ouster process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| I don't believe that should be up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| It should already be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| And our county commissioners should be ensuring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| whether against one or an entire group of government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| who have chosen to ignore the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| I hope we can depend on this body to discuss this matter with the district attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| rather than also becoming complicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Any questions for Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| Any more discussion amongst the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| All right, the motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Yes, I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| You know, the legality of whatever happened or didn't happen, notwithstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| I'm not comfortable being in the business of cleaning up another house's problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| And of all what we just went through with the budget, all the emails, all the phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| I got all the people that talked to me when they ran into me about supporting the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| and supporting our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| As far as this is concerned, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| there's not a single person that was in support of me voting for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| And I am representing these people, and this seems to be their wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| and there's no reason I won't be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| Questions, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5400)|
| 1:30:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Sir, given the memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| and the possibility of a million dollars worth of cuts in the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| do you feel this is a wise spending of taxpayers' money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| I'm sorry, Commissioner, do I believe what is a wise spending of taxpayer dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| Committing roughly $90,000 to this contract annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| Well, you know, we talked last week about the position that Ms. Handler occupies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| and the work that she has done, and, yes, I do feel it's of value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| We have some roughly 8,000 employees in the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| and we're talking about one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| And I think the skill set that she brings to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| and the work that she's been able to do has been valuable to the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| She's been able to work with our operational areas to identify key performance indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| to ensure that they're as efficient and effective as they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| She's been leading and facilitating some of the work around how do we make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| that all the student assessments that we do are either required by the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| or are valuable to inform instruction for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| And so, yes, I believe it is a good investment of resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| and it's been valuable to our school system to have access to the skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| and abilities that she's brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Did she receive any matching grant money at her previous position in Nevada?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Are you aware of what her salary was in 2013 there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| I am not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| A little bit over $41,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| I guess one question, Dr. McIntyre, I have is if, I mean, she's, you brought her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| is she just a one-year employee, or is she going to be someone you keep around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| Is this a yearly contract with Broad, or is this just a one-time grant you're going to keep her on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| No, it's a one-time grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| The question at the end of the period, which is July 30th, I believe it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| the question at the end of the period is do we want to continue her employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| in the position that she has held or not, and that's an independent decision from the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| Well, it's a decision on the part of the Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| but it is independent of the Broad agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| It's independent of the grant itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| That would be a question that we would make, a decision we would make here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| So, in essence, I guess my understanding is this is you vote no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| you send $30,000 back to California or wherever Broad is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| I don't know where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| So, in essence, that's exactly what we'd be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Yeah, that was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| This is going to cost the taxpayers $30,000 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| The water's over the dam or will be in a month, so these funds are pretty much spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5589)|
| 1:33:19| I mean, she's gotten a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| So, I guess I'm trying to understand why we would vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| I mean, I'm fine with never bringing another Broad fellow here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| And I'm betting the school board's going to be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| But I think if we're going to be fiscally responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5616)|
| 1:33:44| we're basically turning down $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| And our taxpayers, the money's been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| So, we're going to have to take out, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| $30,000 out of a potential teacher's assistant or potential cross the street hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| or, you know, toilet paper or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| That money has to come from somewhere to pay this money because it's pretty much been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| This, to me, is just a cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| Now, you know, if folks want to make a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| I think there are better places to make a point than us paying $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| It may be true, Sam, but there's no you making the same mistake twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| I feel like that we need to send a message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| and I think the school board has already received that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| And I think they will be more diligent in the future in the way these things are handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| And I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Commissioner Bussel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| Commissioner McKenzie, I hear what you say about spending the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| But the money was spent before it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| And that should bother us to no end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| That should absolutely, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| how could we look at the people that voted us in office and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| oh, they went ahead and spent it, so it's spent anyway, so we're not going to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| And is it, what is our responsibility to the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| I have had nearly 20 or 30 e-mails come across my, and nobody's in favor of keeping this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5723)|
| 1:35:30| So are we representing the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Are we just going to say, okay, we'll let the superintendent or them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| to do whatever they want to and not follow the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Something's got to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| Something's got to be done to say, hey, it stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| Let's follow what we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| And that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| And that's why I can't support it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| This position has been paid this year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| The person that's been drawing the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| With the contract that hasn't been ratified in the profit channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| So we won't be spending an additional $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| We will just be not receiving that part of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| We already received that part of the grant whenever we thought it went through the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Has the grant been received, Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| I guess for Bob or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| There's Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| Bob Thomas, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| Yes, the grant money has been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| And it has been spent on the purpose that they sent it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| Yes, I'll assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| That's kind of like sending your kid to the grocery store for a gallon of milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| and it comes back with a pocket full of candy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| And this contract will end in less than 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| The end of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| I don't imagine they would ask for the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| You don't think they'll what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| I don't think they'll ask for the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| I mean, in essence, the contract was fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| We're just not approving it if we vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| You know, two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Let me respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| That's a supposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| I can't say that that's, we have no guarantees that they won't ask for that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| So we will have to write a check potentially for, I mean, and to me it would be the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| I mean, if you all want to vote not to do it, no, that's not paying your bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| If we're voting not to do it, we darn well better send that money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| Not our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| It's all our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| We pay, we vote for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| That's our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| That's the one thing we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| And I've said this years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| We represent 500,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| 30 people sending me an e-mail does not mean we're doing the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| That does not mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| No way does that mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| We can't say that we've gotten 50 e-mails or 500 e-mails and we say that we know what the citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5902)|
| 1:38:30| We get out there and we talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5910)|
| 1:38:31| We engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| That's a ploy, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| Don't let that drive you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| But don't say that's indicative or representative of all the people because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So, again, and I'm talking general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| I'm not talking on this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| But, you know, I'm not going to let those 20 e-mails that I've gotten make me spend $30,000 worth of taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5935)|
| 1:39:05| That's what we're going to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| And if we're saying, no, they're okay with it, let's just keep the money, that's not the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| That's not the process, let me say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| That's not the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| We didn't complete the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| If we vote this thing down, we need to write the big A check to the Broad Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| Again, I think the message has been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| If we're really trying to send a message, I think we've sent that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| I think the school board with a 5-4 vote sent that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| I think we, everyone knows that the message is sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| If the next one comes through, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| It's going to come through the right way, otherwise they're not going to get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| But, again, this point, this issue is beyond us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| This issue is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| I don't like that it's done, but the money's been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| So this is a paperwork issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| And we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| We have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| We have cleaned up things that we've not done correctly in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| They have brought things back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Hey, we didn't do this properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| We're going to bring it back before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| So this isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Commissioner Busseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| Again, we had a lawsuit back in 2003 which it said that the county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| or the county executive has to have approved the expenditures of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| and be presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| It was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| It's not a case of where, well, it's already been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| Let's just go ahead and approve it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| That's sending a different message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| If we go ahead and approve it, then we're saying, okay, it's all right to mess up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| and just keep messing up and we'll go ahead and keep coming back and asking for forgiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| instead of asking permission like they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| Now, it's up to us to decide, hey, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| We've already paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| It's what Commissioner McKenzie said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| If we've already paid for something, do we have to pay for it a second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| Are we going to pay for it a second time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Are we legally bound to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| And let me ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Since it's already been paid for, do we have to refund the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| Those will be issues that, depending on how this body votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| that I'll have to address with the school board and the legalities of where it leaves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| But right now, that issue is not before anybody, meaning legislative or administrative board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6107)|
| 1:41:56| So the answer to that will depend on how you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| and it will depend also on the consultation with potential legal actions associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6119)|
| 1:42:08| that would probably have to be discussed with the Board of Education and what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6128)|
| 1:42:16| All right, let's do a roll call vote starting on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Don't remind me again what I'm voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| You're voting to a yes is to approve, no is to disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| Commissioner Brantley votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Commissioner Thomas votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Commissioner Bussler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6172)|
| 1:42:53| Commissioner Owenby votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| Commissioner Broyles is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Commissioner McKenzie votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| The pass wishes to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| Motion fails 9-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Or 1-9, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Motion fails 1-9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6204)|
| 1:43:33| Now the ordinance is listed in second readings will be in zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| It's in the wrong spot on the agenda, so it'll be in the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| So the next item is discussion regarding non-renewal of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| The reason I brought this up for discussion is, I'm sorry, I'm not talking loud enough, my mic's not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6232)|
| 1:43:59| is all the phone calls that I've received for the non-renewals that happened back in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6239)|
| 1:44:12| especially surrounding one teacher, but once I started digging into it and talking to a lot more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6252)|
| 1:44:19| we were up to 35, maybe even more, that were non-renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6259)|
| 1:44:27| And this brought up the question of, you know, I looked at their evaluations and there was nothing in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| there was no reprimands or anything in some of these people's record that I've spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6274)|
| 1:44:46| and it brought up the ordinance that we passed, or I was thinking about the ordinance that we passed back in February of 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| that basically said that people have the right to speak freely about issues that they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6293)|
| 1:45:00| or bring up to this body or the Board of Ed or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| And I remember when we were passing this ordinance, I asked, does this cover teachers as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| And I was told, yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| The way this looks when you start getting all these non-renewals is with no reason given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| or it doesn't fit the vision of the school, it makes you think, or the perception is in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| that they're being retaliated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| And I'm not saying that that's the case, I'm just saying that that's the perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| And we're losing good teachers, and we talk about it every budget year, we don't want to have to cut teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6334)|
| 1:45:44| we need teachers, we need teachers, but yet we're non-renewing good teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| teachers that these communities and these schools, their parents love, and the parents have had no issues with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6348)|
| 1:45:58| None of the staff has, and we've lost good teachers, especially this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| and last year I think we lost 44 to non-renewals, and then this year 35 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| I just think we need to seriously look if it's, and I heard Dr. McIntyre say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| that he lets the principals make this decision, and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| and I know it's a right-to-work state, and I'm good with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| but I think if you're letting someone go, there needs to be some kind of reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| They've done a bad job, or they've had parents complain constantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| or they've been in their office for reprimands all year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| but to just let someone go, it almost is perceived as retaliation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| and I just think that is real wrong, and it's not helping the morale of the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6408)|
| 1:46:55| because now they're all scared, and they're all nervous about speaking up or being able to speak their mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| and that was the whole point of this law, or this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| and I just wanted to bring this up, and I don't know if there's anybody out there that wants to speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| that knows more knowledge about it than I do, but it just concerns me greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| that our school system is losing very good teachers to non-renewals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6438)|
| 1:47:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| These are not discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| These are more like announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| I mean, it is 6 o'clock, and we've got to be here until 7 for zoning, so we might as well as all talk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| Well, first, let me say thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| I see the Mayor, Tim Burchett, is in the audience this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| I appreciate him being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| Also, earlier, Board of Education members were introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| Gloria Dethridge is also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Thank you, members of the Board of Education, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| The one thing I wanted to make an announcement about is not really an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| It sort of follows along this discussion item deal of what I want to talk about is property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6490)|
| 1:48:18| I know we just got through the budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| and we used property tax as a means of supporting the activities of the local government here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6501)|
| 1:48:32| Another thing that I want to discuss in front of fellow commissioners that are new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| is something that it's difficult for us to talk about because we can't talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| But as it goes to property tax, some that have been here longer remember the mulch facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6522)|
| 1:48:52| a long, contentious, really a struggle about whether Knox County was going to be in the mulch business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6532)|
| 1:49:02| When Knox County got out of the mulch business, we accumulated over a million dollars from that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6542)|
| 1:49:11| Sometime after that, there was another issue came up related to what I'll call Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| before larger commission that Hillcrest, I think, be leased or sold for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6559)|
| 1:49:31| And we, I think, cooler heads prevailed, and we were against that until a better deal came along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6571)|
| 1:49:40| and Hillcrest was sold, bringing in millions of dollars to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| adding to the property tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| Going to the other end of the scale for just a second, the convenience facility, Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| near Harbinson's Crossroads, a couple of acres, sold for less than $20,000, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| So you'll notice that I have always been a person on the side of seeing property being in the hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6603)|
| 1:50:13| privately held, people that are doing something with it, improving it, and increasing the tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| property tax base here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I would commend Trustee Ed Schaus to the fact that he had a successful delinquent tax property sale earlier in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6624)|
| 1:50:34| Thousands of dollars were paid in, properties changed hands, and this is not properties that are $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6634)|
| 1:50:42| These are $10,000 properties up to over $100,000 properties sold in the delinquent property tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6642)|
| 1:50:52| In the June, let's see, let me make sure, the June 4th edition of the local paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| the second chance on surplus property was brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6657)|
| 1:51:06| and I think 99 pieces, 99 parcels in Knox County changed hands, got the property tax paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6666)|
| 1:51:18| and are probably being added to someone else's acreage, which is going to maybe increase their property tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| but it's a benefit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| There is also a, that was surplus property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| There is currently being set forward, which we'll see in a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| a delinquent property tax sale after the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6698)|
| 1:51:46| The reason that I bring such things forward is I want us to make sure that we push along these lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6706)|
| 1:51:54| The best way is not to cut services to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6714)|
| 1:52:02| The best way to have better service is to have better revenue streams, and property tax is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6722)|
| 1:52:10| So encourage everyone that you can to look at surplus property, delinquent properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| and get those things back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| And that's my soapbox for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| The other thing that I wanted to say something about was also in local paper, blooming, business is blooming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6743)|
| 1:52:34| The Oaks Farm in Corrington Annual Daylily Festival is coming up this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6754)|
| 1:52:43| I want everyone to get out to Corrington, to the Oaks Daylily Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| Buy yourself a daylily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| Have a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Maybe you can even get a meal out that way and see the best-looking rural part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6772)|
| 1:53:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Before the meeting, Chris handed out the financials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| Anybody have any questions of Chris before we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Because we're about to adjourn until zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Is there any other business before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| All right, we adjourn until 7 o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=6799)|

| 1:57:49| The next item is 5-E-15-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| It's an appeal by James R. Gentry, option holder of MPC's denial of rezoning from PR Plan Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| at up to 12 dwelling units per acre to PR Plan Residential at up to 18 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| located on the east side of Snyder Road, north side of Outlet Drive, and the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7085)|
| 1:58:13| Commissioner or Mr. Seymour is here representing Mr. Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| Mr. Gentry, is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I have sent a letter sort of outlining what has occurred with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7101)|
| 1:58:29| This property, which is approximately 13 acres, come on up here, Mr. Gentry, if I may, and let me get your help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7109)|
| 1:58:37| was rezoned from low-density residential to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| When that was done, it was anticipated that the property immediately to the east, several acres could be acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| combined with this and an apartment development done at 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| The property owner is just not interested in selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| It's not a matter of price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| She has been offered a very good price and well beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| So Mr. Gentry has a national apartment developer that wants to put apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7150)|
| 1:59:17| It's on Outlet Drive at Snyder Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| You all, over the last couple of years, have spent I think $3.6 million redoing Outlet Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| with the idea that you will promote development on the other side of the interstate from Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7166)|
| 1:59:34| That development has not occurred yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| This apartment developer wants to put about 225, 250 units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| The economics today on upscale apartments require that a developer build at least 225 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7183)|
| 1:59:56| and that is for the following reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| You have to have good amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| That includes pool, exercise, clubhouse, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| You have to maintain the apartments in a first-class condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| and the economics sort of come out at 225 units for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| So we are back here asking you to consider remanding to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7219)|
| 2:00:27| and ask MPC to consider a sector plan amendment that would allow high-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7227)|
| 2:00:36| a sector plan amendment from MDR to HDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Now, the MPC, and I had a lot of discussions with them before this came up at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| They said, well, there are several reasons we do not like high-density residential in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| One, no public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| Well, these apartments that are being developed in the West Knoxville corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| are not dependent on public transit like some may be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| They said there are no community facilities nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| Well, just across the interstate, and you can cross either Campbell Station or Lovell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| you have the Turkey Creek Shopping Center, which I think is the biggest commercial development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| There are parks around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| Now, I realize Farragut has written a letter opposing this, I guess opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7285)|
| 2:01:31| I've talked to Mark Shipley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| But Farragut, although this is in their urban growth boundary, cannot annex this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7293)|
| 2:01:39| unless the property owner requests to be annexed, according to recent state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7299)|
| 2:01:46| But I'm submitting to you that there is no better location in Knox County outside the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7306)|
| 2:01:55| and outside the city of Knoxville for high-density residential than this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| You've got an excellent road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| It's not very far from the interchange of Campbell Station Road and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| It's on a newly improved road that has very little, if any, traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| The last time I drove it, I think I saw one other car between where you left the motels at Campbell Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7333)|
| 2:02:20| and you got close up to Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| So Mr. Gentry can tell you what he's been through trying to find apartment property at this part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7343)|
| 2:02:34| for this developer, and he just hasn't been able to find any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| Is that correct, Mr. Gentry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| And you might explain the other attributes of this property if I have not covered it adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| Well, there's a lot of property that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7367)|
| 2:02:53| We probably looked at 35 or 40 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| They're not big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| They've got environmental problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| They're price prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| They don't have the correct access or the visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| And as far as I can tell, this is the only piece in the county that this particular developer wants to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7386)|
| 2:03:17| It's a flat piece of property, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| It's very manageable topographically, but there's just not a whole lot out there to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7399)|
| 2:03:28| You know, the demographics have got to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7408)|
| 2:03:30| This property has got great demographics, very high incomes within just a few miles of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7410)|
| 2:03:37| I think they're between $92,000 and $106,000 on the demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| Like I said, there's nothing else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7422)|
| 2:03:45| I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| I'm sorry, James Gentry, 5400 Gaineswood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| And I'm Arthur Seymour, 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7433)|
| 2:04:00| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| You came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| I don't know if you're in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Okay, you're with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| I'm going to make a motion that we refer or initiate a sector plan amendment to allow high density residential on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| Mr. Kelly, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| To initiate a sector plan amendment for MPC to consider for high density residential on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| Mr. Kelly, do you mind come to the, oh, was I recognized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Mr. Kelly, on the previous four items we just voted on, those items were recommended by the staff for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| and either got a 14 to 0 vote from the planning commission or an 11 to 3 vote on the four previous items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7487)|
| 2:04:55| On this item that's before us, this has been, was denied by the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7495)|
| 2:05:01| and was also the sector plan change was denied by the MPC commissioners on an 11 to 3 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7501)|
| 2:05:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| It's either 11 to 3 or 10 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Well, the minutes say 11 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| So the staff is saying no to this and the MPC commissioners are saying to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7516)|
| 2:05:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| The matter came before the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| Commissioner Clancy made a motion to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| There was a lot of discussion regarding the matter back and forth between the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7535)|
| 2:05:41| Most of the discussion appeared to be that in favor of the gentleman's request and the vote was taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7541)|
| 2:05:50| and it was 11 to 3 against the recommending denial of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7550)|
| 2:05:56| The justification, I guess it came basically down to the amendment as presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7556)|
| 2:06:07| there wasn't a justification for making the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| The road improvements were in place when the plan was done previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| The access, again, the idea of not having access to public transit was an issue that was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7577)|
| 2:06:27| One commissioner basically said, I think it's too dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| They thought going above 12 was too dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| and also said that they believed that the applicant had a reasonable use of his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7594)|
| 2:06:40| and, therefore, the motion was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| One of the issues with regard to apartment development in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| and I guess by virtue of the fact of having worked at MPC forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| apartments in the county outside the city are actually pretty rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7614)|
| 2:07:02| Developments have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| The older apartments, I guess if you want to think about it now, are in the Cedar Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| There has been a recent spurt of apartment development in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| But other than that, there are a very limited number of apartment developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| similar to what the applicant is wanting to do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| I think part of that in the past has had to do with just there wasn't the infrastructure in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| in order to be able to support that type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| and there may not have been considered a market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| Times have changed in the sense that you see what's going on in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| This previous request that you had will result in another set of apartments in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7662)|
| 2:07:50| So I think when you send this matter back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| they will consider your request and at that point you will have a matter back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| It will probably be September before it gets back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| but you will have a matter to act on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Can we talk about something else, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| And actually, if we can, can we kind of bleed over to the rezoning a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| or just so it's relevant to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| There is no rezoning yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| Well, we'll hold off then on the rezoning portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| But the main thing is the Planning Commission did not want to go from medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| to high density residential by their vote of 11 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| That was the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| Commissioner Brantley, or Thomas, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7722)|
| 2:08:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| I can remember when this road was a ghost town and it almost still is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7729)|
| 2:08:59| We completed that road all the way through to Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| which for years everybody kept saying if we just get that road through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| everything will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Well, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| If you've driven out there on that road, as Mr. Seymour said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| I hardly see a car, I hardly see anything out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| I think we needed somebody that was willing to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7759)|
| 2:09:24| and put something out there that's going to bring people out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| that will bring more services, more businesses, and more tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| Now, if this was someplace else, I probably wouldn't be for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7772)|
| 2:09:38| I think that's a good place for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| It's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| This is not splitting money with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| Personally, I'm glad somebody is putting money into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7787)|
| 2:09:52| and I'm definitely for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7795)|
| 2:09:58| When the sector plan was created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| there was a design and a thought that would happen with that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7800)|
| 2:10:05| Since that hasn't taken place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| wouldn't that necessitate an economic change for changing the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Well, it was shown on the sector plan for medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7812)|
| 2:10:18| And in February of this year, the property was rezoned earlier this year from six units per acre to 12 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7818)|
| 2:10:29| in compliance with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| And I don't know if that had any effect on the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| in their deliberations that they had already made one change on the same piece of property this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| and that they felt that they had already recommended to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7841)|
| 2:10:47| what they believed the appropriate use of the property was at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| Commissioner Skinneker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| Mr. Kelly, since you brought up the rezoning then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| January of this year it was zoned at six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| And then in February they appeared before the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| and got 100% zoning change from six dwelling units to 12 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| And it came before us in March and we approved that for this particular site at 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7872)|
| 2:11:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| And now they're coming back and asking for a 200% increase in zoning density over what it originally was in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7879)|
| 2:11:27| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7887)|
| 2:11:30| What they're asking for is an amendment to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| You brought up the rezoning and that's why I was just following up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7893)|
| 2:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| If you want to talk about the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| the rezoning from six to 12 units per acre was in compliance with the sector plan as written and adopted at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| And so from that standpoint, he was in the limits of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| The property adjoining it is also zoned 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| It would have made good sense to recommend 12 units per acre on that property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7917)|
| 2:12:04| Before we vote, I'm going to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| Of course, Brantley and I live out there, but we see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| those apartments out there are 90%, 95% full all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Some of them have wait lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| And so obviously the market is out there and I think it is a good use of that investment of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| And so I'm kind of glad we're considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| I'm glad that somebody is willing to put some money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| Mr. Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| My only, I agree with you in all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| The only thing that I have a problem with is Campbell Station Road and that intersection and 18 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| That intersection of Campbell Station and the interstate is being remodeled now by TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| because of the heavy traffic of people exiting the interstate to go to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7964)|
| 2:12:49| With this number of units and Lovell Road and Hardin Valley interchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| I can't go for it because it's just too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7975)|
| 2:12:58| I think it's already been approved at enough to handle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| and then if time comes and they expand in years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| but those intersections are just a horrible mess as it is right now, and this will just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7985)|
| 2:13:11| I would say that I think that Hardin Valley or that Campbell Station will be done before the apartments are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| Well, I'm not a builder, so I don't know, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| Maybe you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| It's well on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| We've got a motion to send on to MPC as a request for a sector plan amendment for high-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8003)|
| 2:13:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| So two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| Six ayes, two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| Brantley and Schoonmaker, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| So is that six to two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| Then we've got to do the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8027)|
| 2:13:53| Can we hold the zoning until September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| Yeah, you can't get the zoning until you've got sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8036)|
| 2:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Ordinance O-15-5-101 is amended in Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning, Article 3, Sections 3.51.01 through 3.51.05| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8043)|
| 2:14:15| to change requirements related to off-street parking lot layout, construction, and maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| This amends Ordinance O-06-7-101, adopted August 28, 2006, and O-12-9-102, adopted October 22, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8061)|
| 2:14:32| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| We have a motion, Commissioner Smith, and second by Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| All in the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| Any other things before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| The one that didn't show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| Christopher Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Is there a motion to make that for next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8100)|
| 2:15:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Any other business before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom150622?start=8109)|
