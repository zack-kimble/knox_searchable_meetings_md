| 0:00:07| City Council. We appreciate everybody being here tonight and for those who are watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=7)|
| 0:00:11| on TV. Before we get started, I wanted to call on our police chief, David Roush, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=11)|
| 0:00:17| share some unfortunate news with us. Thank you, Mayor. Last night, actually, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| this hour, we lost an officer to a motorcycle crash over in Sevierville. Officer David Munson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=23)|
| 0:00:33| has been with the police department since July of 2011. Officer Munson has survived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=33)|
| 0:00:40| by his wife and his parents and two brothers. He worked very hard for this community, did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=40)|
| 0:00:51| a wonderful job, was a fine young man, wonderful officer. The arrangements that I just received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=51)|
| 0:01:02| on Thursday evening from 5 to 7 p.m., we'll be receiving friends, family at Chilhowee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=62)|
| 0:01:10| Hills Baptist Church, 4615 Asheville Highway. Funeral service will be Friday at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=70)|
| 0:01:18| at the church. Procession following will proceed by the KPD en route to his final resting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=78)|
| 0:01:26| place in Seymour, behind the Ashley Funeral Home there. We appreciate, we've had lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=86)|
| 0:01:34| of calls of support from the community, from our partners, and we very much appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| it. I want to let Council know I spoke with Officer Munson's father and with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| wife this afternoon, and I know his wife, Christina, said she was just overwhelmed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| the showing of support from KPD and others in the community, and they were very grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| for that. So I'm going to ask, before we're going to have the invocation given by Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| Della Vopi and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Finbar Saunders, let's stand for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| of silence in memory of Officer Munson and thinking of his family as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=129)|
| 0:02:30| Heavenly Father, thank you for this blessed day and the opportunity to save the beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| of our East Tennessee countryside. Thank you for the opportunity to this Council to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| its community. Our hearts and our minds reach out to David Munson's family, his wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| and brothers, parents, and others who are in this time of grief. Let us be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=167)|
| 0:02:56| about all of our uniformed bodies as they go about their business in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| and as Council people, let us treat all who come before us with dignity and respect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| fairness and keep us ever mindful of those less fortunate than ourselves. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| Please face the flag and render the salute. I pledge allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| Please call the roll, Ms. Mitchum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=215)|

| 0:03:50| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Okay. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| We have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Thank you, Mayor, and I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson if he'll also expound on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| but I'd like to make a motion to withdraw 12 D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Okay. Mr. Swanson, do you want to explain why we're doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| I will expound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Expound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Explain or expound, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| In the zoning code, it provides with respect to amendments to the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=269)|
| 0:04:38| under Article 7, Section 6D, provides that all amendments initiated by application filed with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=278)|
| 0:04:48| shall be finally acted upon by the council within 120 days following the public hearing provided for in paragraph B of this Section 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=288)|
| 0:04:58| which, in fact, is the hearing, the public hearing before the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| and failure of the council finally to act upon any proposal within said 120-day period shall be, in all respects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| equivalent to rejection thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| All three of these items were items that were initiated by application with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=314)|
| 0:05:22| The Metropolitan Planning Commission public hearing on these matters was held on May the 9th of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=322)|
| 0:05:30| 120 days from then would be September the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Since we are past September 6th, as I read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| it would provide that it shall in all respects be the equivalent of a rejection of each of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| I can understand that there might be a difference of opinion as to whether this applies to not only the rezoning itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| but also the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| But in my view, in reading the wording that's there, frankly, I think it applies to all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| because all three are amendments that were initiated by an application with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| And the council, Mr. Seymour had signed up to speak on this item, so we'll hear him now as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| Mayor, members of council, I agree on the zoning part, which is 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=378)|
| 0:06:26| I agree the time has expired, and that should be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| 12D and E deal with separate ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| The section Mr. Swanson referred to deals with the ordinance, and it is part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=393)|
| 0:06:44| But D and E deal with the general plan and the one-year plan, which are not part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| They are adopted as the one-year plan is adopted as a separate ordinance by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| upon recommendation of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| Likewise, the general plan is readopted every year in a separate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| I would request, I have talked to Mr. Klein, who represents certain neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| and he and I have agreed that 12F is moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| But 12D and E would be postponed for two weeks for further discussion on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| I have discussed the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| I have not with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| I've discussed it with Mr. Frost today and Mr. Donaldson on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| or not the time period has expired on the one-year plan and the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=459)|
| 0:07:47| And I think we were in agreement that since they were not part of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| they were not had not been rejected by the lapse of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=473)|
| 0:08:07| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Certainly, I respect Mr. Seymour's opinion and have for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| He's a great lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| If I represented his client, my argument would probably be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| I have to say, though, that as I read this part of the code, this is referring to the zoning ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=495)|
| 0:08:23| All of this comes out of Appendix A, which is the zoning ordinance to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| And it says, Section 6, the regulations, restrictions, boundaries, and options set forth in this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| may, upon proper application by the property owner or his designated representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| or by an appropriate governmental agency or the city council, be amended, supplemented, revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| or repealed from time to time as conditions warrant as hereinafter set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| And to me, that's such broad language that I believe that the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| and the one-year plans are all part of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| It says everything in this ordinance that you try to amend by an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| filed with the Metropolitan Planning Commission has this 120-day limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| So I respectfully disagree with Mr. Seymour's opinion with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| And it's my opinion that it is applicable to all three of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| May I respectfully disagree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| I disagree because Article 1, Section 2 refers to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| and it defines what the ordinance is, which is the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| And the one-year plan and the general plan or sector plan, as we would have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| are adopted by separate ordinances, separate and apart from the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| And Article 7, Section 6, simply refers to this ordinance, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I don't have it in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| I have it over here in my notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I guess we could do did-to-did-not all night, but I'll just withdraw at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| I'd like to hear from councils, legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you, Councilman Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Mr. Seymour accurately represented our we had a conversation this morning of about 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| and we got MPC Executive Director Mark Donaldson on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| To be honest, my first impression was in agreement with what Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| I mean, if you look at the form itself, it actually says plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| And we got Mr. Donaldson on the phone, who walked through the steps as he saw that they fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| that Mr. Donaldson did not think that the 120-day limitation was going to apply to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=632)|
| 0:10:44| To be honest, Mr. Donaldson is the Executive Director of MPC, so I did defer to his knowledge of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| But I confess my initial impression matched that of the city law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| We have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Let me call on Councilman Del Valle, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I just want to ask either of these councils up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| there's no requirement that we act on less than all of the provisions that is a sector plan, a one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=667)|
| 0:11:15| and a zoning ordinance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| We are free to act or not act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| With regard to the motion withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Or with regard to the substance of the debate that you two had over is it barred or is it not barred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| It would be Mr. Seymour's opinion that you are free to do whatever you want to do with regard to the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=687)|
| 0:11:36| and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| It sounds like he would agree that essentially the zoning plan is moot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| It's my opinion that all three are moot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| But as a practical matter, regardless of the legalities, we are free to adopt or not adopt any request for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=706)|
| 0:11:53| even if it's recommended or not by MPC once we've heard the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| If I understand what you're saying, you could adopt the motion to withdraw all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| regardless of whether Mr. Seymour is right or whether I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| If I'm right, you couldn't go ahead and act and amend the sector plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| You could not do that if I'm right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Because it would have passed out of the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Because it's passed the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Mr. Donaldson, a withdrawal is the same effect as a denial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=744)|
| 0:12:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Here's the bottom line for me, which this is my district that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| And I don't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| I do understand that we're going to have another piece of property that's going to join this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| and that you're going to come back to us with both pieces of property together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| I just personally have a problem going ahead and changing the sector plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| until we get the zoning to where it needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| and also be able to make sure that the neighborhoods surrounding that area understand what's going on also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| So my preference would be that we do it all at one time and that we let this die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| If I may respond, the adjoining property, which belongs to Mike Chase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| will be before you all in two weeks on the regular progression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| MPC heard the sector plan, the one-year plan, and the zoning on it, and it will be up next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=801)|
| 0:13:30| Excuse me, your next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| That has been the reason for the delay on this because the proposal is to combine the two properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| and do a project that involves both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| Mr. Klein requested, who represents the neighborhood, initially called me, I think last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=827)|
| 0:13:55| and requested that this matter be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| And I said, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| In a discussion today, I advised him that the time had run out on the zoning, so it should be withdrawn or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=840)|
| 0:14:11| But the sector plan and the one-year plan should be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Now, the property cannot be rezoned as requested by the applicant unless the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| and the one-year plan are amended because at the present time they call for low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| which is five units or under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We are looking at a combined condominium development for this property between the Smith property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| and the Chase property, which will be up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| And it would be best if we could hear the sector plan and the one-year plan on both properties at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=885)|
| 0:14:54| in two weeks, or at a time that Mr. Klein and counsel and I find best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=894)|
| 0:15:04| I think part of the problem, too, is that I know my colleagues don't really know what's going on between the two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| And it just seems to me that you folks ought to just start all over and come to us with a complete package so that we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| And I was not aware until just before counsel in terms of about the, you know, the withdrawal of all three and about the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| But I think that, you know, my recommendation for the district and for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| and everyone to really see what's going on is for them to be able to see a total plan with the two parcels of property together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| And we are going to be having a neighborhood meeting in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| We intend to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| There are preliminary plans that have been developed to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| We intend, Mr. Klein and I are going to have a meeting sometime to discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| and I'll be happy to go ahead and send the preliminary plans to everybody for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| Well, what's the problem with waiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Well, the problem is we cannot go back to MPC on the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| because of the ordinance that adopts the one-year plan until January of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=964)|
| 0:16:16| And it cannot come back to city council until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| And I don't think anybody has requested that Mr. Klein has requested that the sector plan on behalf of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=982)|
| 0:16:30| that the sector plan or the one-year plan be voted down tonight or withdrawn tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| His request to me was postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| I said, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I understand the zoning is gone and it will have to be filed at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| But the zoning and the sector plan and one-year plan do not have to be heard at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| You can file for a sector plan and a one-year plan amendment without filing an accompanying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| That's done quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Councilman Wallace, I see your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| Did you want to speak as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| You lost me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| So I guess I'll go back to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| And, Mr. Klein, it looks like you want to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Mr. Wallace, do you want to go ahead first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Yeah, go ahead and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Mr. Klein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Very briefly, Wayne Klein here for the neighborhood, for the Dean Hill Neighborhood Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| And I was not aware of all of the issues that have come to light tonight when I spoke with Mr. Seymour today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1045)|
| 0:17:34| I'm here basically on the Chase property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| That's why I was hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| So I don't want you to be confused that somehow I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| I think Councilman Grieve's opinions should carry the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| Mr. Swanson, I'm glad you're with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| And also, Councilman Mark Donaldson, did you want to add something to this as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| We have to keep in mind that our administrative rules with respect to bringing back applications that have been denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1076)|
| 0:18:06| is to not take an application for a similar zone or one-year plan amendment for a period of one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| So the effect of denying the one-year plan would, in fact, take medium-density residential off the table as an application for 12 months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1094)|
| 0:18:32| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Well, I guess that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Is that the way you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Are you saying they're already off the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| You're saying they're already off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| I mean, we've already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| The way I read the code, it says, shall in all respects equivalent to rejection thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| I'm not sure that can be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| So it's off anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| It's off anyway for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| That's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| For a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| In my opinion, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Eight until May 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Or to what date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| To the day they first applied or the date it expired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| I would defer to Mr. Donaldson to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| That's an MPC administrative rule, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Yeah, that is our administrative rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| And I would expect that it would be the 121st day that the new year would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| But, again, we're only talking about the Smith property would be off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| The Chase property could still go since it hasn't come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| It comes up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| And the intention is to combine the Smith and the Chase property for an ultimate condo apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1177)|
| 0:19:49| So if you're going to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| I would like to talk to this further with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| And I would request respectfully that the 12D and E be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1197)|
| 0:20:07| But we can't. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Councilman Dalvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Yeah, I think I'd like to call the question and see if we can get this resolved at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| It seems to me that if they're going to combine properties and do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| they're going to be in a separate application and the one-year plan is not going to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| they're not going to run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| But I think we should call the question and move on to the heart of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| So without objection, we have a motion now to withdraw 12E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I'm sorry, 12D, E, and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| So that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| We have 5B, items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| And I don't know if this needs a motion or not, but 9A is listed to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| It does need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I will move to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| For how long do you want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Just for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Councilman. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| I mean, Vice Mayor Pavlis could not be here and he wanted to be here for that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Two weeks then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Are there any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| What is yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| It is . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Another postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| And I think there are a couple of people who would like to speak to it, but it's 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| 12G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| That is the rezoning on Westland and Morrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Good evening, Mayor, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| I'm John Britton, 620 Market Street here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| I'm here this evening on behalf of my partner, John King, who has recently been retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| to represent the Homeowners Association there in Westmoreland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| Mr. King was hired last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| He contacted Mr. Seymour and asked that this matter be postponed for a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| because he has to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| And so we're here this evening asking for the postponement because Mr. King's absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| he won't be back in town until, I think, Thursday of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| Sir, did you also want to speak to it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Madam Mayor, Council, Jim B. Miller, 7219 Lawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| I spoke to several of you on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I met with Mr. King two weeks ago tomorrow, and he agreed to look into this for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| but he told me he was going to be out of town and was going to request a reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| And I spoke to several of you last Friday, and because of him being out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| and wondering if he was going to have that reset done, I spoke to several of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| as if we were going to go ahead and hear this matter tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| So I apologize for that confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| But he had talked to Mr. Seymour in the meantime, and they'd agreed to the reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Councilman Grieve, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Mr. King called me last week and advised he was going to be out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| and asked if this could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| I said I had no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Would you like that for 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I think he requested two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| So we have a motion and a second to postpone 12G for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Oh, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| I thought I had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I'm trying to figure out why we need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| I think there's been some discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Personally, I'm ready to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I don't know if my colleagues agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| I'm trying to figure out what's going to be accomplished by postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| I want their counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I was thinking it was a request and, you know, trying to make it two more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| try to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| I think we've got a history here of giving people all the time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| to bring something back, and both parties asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I think we ought to be granted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| I agree with Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| I'm not really sure why we're postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| This has been postponed more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| There's a lot of confusion about what kind of a plan is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| One plan is for assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1485)|
| 0:24:50| One plan is for three residences per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Another group wants one house per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| and another group just wants to leave it wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| So I'm not really sure what will be gained by a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| Okay, well, I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Are you going to abstain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| I'm going to abstain on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Now that I see some colleagues are against, you know, this is a contingent issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| So unless somebody withdraws that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| then we will vote on it and see whether there's support to postpone it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| or to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Clarification, postponement for two weeks is what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| Two weeks, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| The neighborhood wants it postponed for what reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| I mean, they made it perfectly clear that in terms of what you folks wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| with the 17 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| So what, as Mr. Saunders says, what's going to be gained by two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| Councilman, I believe that our position is that we didn't oppose the original plan for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| And at this point, there has not been a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| It's been reset once at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| And at this point, we don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| So I don't know how we can oppose a zoning or ask for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| if we don't really have a plan to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| So that's why we wanted to go ahead and hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| We were trying to marshal the neighborhood so we could get our petition in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| and get the neighborhood here, and we had to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| It takes a few days to do that, so that's why we were talking about this on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| And it's just almost professional courtesy on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Mr. King had talked to Mr. Seymour before we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| They had talked and agreed to the request, and so that's part of our reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| Well, let me make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| It was my understanding when we've been discussing this that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| and maybe Mr. Donaldson can comment, that that property has been rezoned for X number of watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| Correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| And that was done in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| The property is currently zoned R1 and has been for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| R1 would allow development of a subdivision at a density of about four units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| The Planning Commission's recommendation was to do a planned zoned district at no more than three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| That planned residential district also allows as a permitted use assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| Okay, but what was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| What went before MPC and was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| MPC made a recommendation on this zoning in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| July, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| And is that in the neighborhood was not aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| No, previous to that, there was a plan that was approved that I thought was 17 residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| And part of this is when the applicants represented by council and we're not, we're at a severe disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| It's that old adage, a person that tries to represent themselves has a fool for a client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| So that's why we thought because of the intricacies of this, it would be important for us to retain Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1682)|
| 0:28:11| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to postpone 12G for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=1693)|

| 0:35:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| I see that Jim Hagerman is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I know this is proposed by MPC and Mark Donaldson's group, but as we eliminate these turn radiuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| on corners, are we going to have a problem with, you know, traffic rolling over curbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| or are there going to be issues you foresee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I get this idea they're trying to move the streetscape closer to the road and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| uniform front, but do you foresee any problems with cutting out the turn radius?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| This is not a place where you're likely to see a lot of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| So it's the longer vehicles you're concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| It does have a, yeah, for turn radii, and this particular intersection does have a signal, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2189)|
| 0:36:40| It will have a signal under the new Cumberland plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| That's one reason I would recommend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| And we will have one of the conditions it's subject to is sight distance, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2206)|
| 0:36:56| So that there's ample clearance for making the turn before you actually approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| And you can see anything coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| My question was really posed because I was afraid that we would eliminate the turn radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| and then five years from now we'd be buying it back and trying to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| cut the corner of the building off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| But you don't see that as an issue coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I don't see that as happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2237)|

| 0:37:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Let me ask one question of Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Mark, I guess we're getting into sort of implementing the ideas of the Cumberland Avenue District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| You refer to a street wall and this image of what we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| What exactly are we talking about so that we're all using the same lingo as we get into this sort of Cumberland Avenue corridor development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2295)|
| 0:38:25| One of the fundamentals of the plan was to pay attention to the street as a public space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2305)|
| 0:38:36| and as we created the Forum District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| we decided to move away from the pattern of a minimum setback to a required building line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| with the thought that the building facades help to frame that public space that we share with everybody called the streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2329)|
| 0:39:03| All the buildings sort of align and you have this uniform look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| There's a required building line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| and then there's a requirement that a certain percentage of every building has to be built to that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| So through the combination of building frontages and street landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| you create a framework for this public space that we share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So it's an aesthetic constraint, so to speak, to pull it together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Yeah, I would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| and make a recommendation to City Council regarding the possible addition of home office to the zoning regulation definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| and potentially allowing home offices in R1E low-density exclusive residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| Requested by Councilmember Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Mayor, we have a couple of people that would like to talk to this to bring about the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I'd like to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Come forward to explain about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Set the timer for the up to five minutes each for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| I appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| My name is Amy Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I live at 5015 West Summit Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| I am currently the president of the Forest Heights Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| As many of you may recall, Councilmember Grieve proposed a resolution early last March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| to rezone Forest Heights neighborhood from its current R1 zone to the more exclusive R1E zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2439)|
| 0:40:47| This action was requested by our neighborhood association in response to a house that was being remodeled to be a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2447)|
| 0:40:58| However, after the resolution was passed, about ten neighbors came out in strong opposition to this rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| The reason was not because they supported duplexes in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| It was because they had currently had a home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| and would lose their right to file a use on review in order to protect their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| They did not have the typical home occupation that you might think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| They did not see clients in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| They did not have employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| They did not have a sign in their front yard or increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| They basically had a home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| They simply worked from their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Having a home office is currently included under MPC's definition of home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| and having a home occupation is not allowed in the R1E zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| In June, we tabled MPC's vote to rezone the neighborhood in hopes that a compromise could be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| and that we could have the support of the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| After speaking with Councilman Grieve, MPC Director Mark Donaldson, and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| the compromise was agreed on that we would create a new definition of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| a home office definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| This new definition would be amended to the R1 or the R1E zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| While MPC will be responsible for establishing the criteria for this new definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| we hope that the definition will be restrictive enough that as a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| you would have no idea that anyone in your neighborhood would have this type of home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| We have spoken with the Westwood and West Hills communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| who are the only two neighborhoods within the city that have the R1E zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| They both support the creation of this definition and amending it to the R1E zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| Our plan is to untable the MPC's vote to rezone our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| once the new definition is amended to the R1E zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| We feel that there are currently hundreds of residents across Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| illegally operating a home office in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| This resolution is just the first step in support of these neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| They'll call on you when it's time for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| So stick by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Are you speaking as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| I'm John Ulmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| I live at 4124 Jimandua Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| I would only add one thing to what Amy has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| and that is this is a case where technology has moved beyond the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| When the zoning ordinance was adopted in the early 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| the home office definition has not been amended since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| At that time, we didn't have fax machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| We didn't have computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| We did have telephones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| But now it's common for people to work at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| to have an actual job working for somebody else while working at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| So in this case, I believe that technology has moved beyond the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| and it's time to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| So we have a motion and a second to pass 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| No, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| We do not have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| The other zones that are not named in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| are home offices allowed in those zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Are they excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Are they falling under the, you know, I'm a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I need some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| And I think Mark Donaldson is the one who needs to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| The R1E zone district is unique amongst the residential zones in that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| doesn't address home occupations at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| All of the other zone districts allow home occupations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| That particular use was stripped from the permitted uses for the R1E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| So there is a pathway for people within other zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| to get a home office as well as a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| If I live in another district that has home occupations allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| and I want to have a home office, what do I have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| and how do I know that I have to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| You have to get approval by the Planning Commission as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| And you probably would know that only if there was a complaint against you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| filed by someone and the Permits and Inspections Department followed up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| So this is another one of our famous complaint-driven ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| It is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| I said one of several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Yeah, I suspect from Councilwoman Palmer's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| we ought to be thinking as you look at this at any broader definition that includes some of the concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| the young lady, Amy, mentioned, which are for a home office use that involves using phones, computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| and pieces of paper and a light on your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| I can't imagine anyone going for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| That's different than the list of home occupations like doctor, lawyer, beauty parlor, and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| where you attract customers into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| But it seems to me that the casual use of your house for any purpose that's not grossly unlawful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| ought to be left up to the homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| So the definition ought to look at that maybe being broader as it goes across the zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| I want to add that I got an e-mail from Dr. Pilo, who's the immediate past president of the West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| and he wanted us to know that they also support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| Did you get this e-mail in your home office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| I got it in my home office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| Okay, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Well, I have some concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| And one of the concerns, in the past, this council and other councils have made requests from MPC to explore something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2832)|
| 0:47:22| to come back with something, and then it didn't look like our vision at the time we made that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| And I would just like to say that I do not want to see that happen again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| because that is a lot of time and efforts expended by MPC with community events and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| So I really hope that when something comes back, if this passes this body tonight, that we don't decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| I don't like the way that looks, and we do one of our U-turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| Councilman Grieve, are you responding or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| I'm sort of responding, but I do want to say that working with both these individuals and their neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| they've done a lot of work in not only reaching out to the other zones that are comparable to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| but they've also worked with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| And I think that they have a fairly clear definition of what they're looking for, and I think MPC understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| So I think this is going to be a little bit different than some of the things in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| So I hope that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| So call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2909)|

| 0:48:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| 11B is a resolution expressing appreciation to Pilot Corporation for the donation of a 165-square-foot permanent drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| and a 1,027-square-foot temporary construction easement within certain real property located at 3615 Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| as part of the Sutherland Avenue sidewalk project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2936)|

| 0:49:16| I'm sorry, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| I think, if I'm not mistaken, this is a minority business that is receiving this once it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| and we've been working on trying to help some of our minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| I'm glad to see this hopefully be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Yes, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2972)|

| 0:49:40| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a development agreement with the Walnut Street Garage LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| for the transfer of certain real property owned by the city located at the intersection of Summer Place and Locust Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| as consideration for the construction of a multi-story parking garage on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| and which agreement which incorporates the relevant obligations of a memorandum of understanding between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| and TVA will result in the termination of the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| Councilman Della Votia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Christy, I want to thank you for all your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| It's obvious that a lot of thought went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I know we're all excited about that garage being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| I thought there was some provision in there that after 15 years the lease would expire unless maybe TVA opted for another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3022)|
| 0:50:31| What happens if at the end of 15 years it's not leased in terms of the right of public use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| Is that going to be treated differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| On nights and weekends the public would use this garage free of charge as part of our effort to encourage folks to go downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3039)|
| 0:50:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Councilman Laskin, Chief Operating Officer, Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| The lease agreement now is between TVA and the private developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| but the covenant that provides free parking to citizens on the weekends and the evenings will run with the property regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3055)|
| 0:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| So we're protected regardless of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| We're protected regardless of any leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3067)|

| 0:51:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I was just curious in the proposal or the package that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| We only got half the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And I would just like to see the other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| You only got half the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Walnut Street Garage LLC, the representatives are here this evening and they brought the plans with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| I was hoping we were going to build the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Do you want to see the better half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| We'll ask Mr. Petrie if he plans on building the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Joe, is this going to be half at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I mean, Joe Petrie, I'm at the Langley Building, 520 West Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| And, yes, we intend to build the whole building and nothing but the whole building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| So help me God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| You do have drawings we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| We do have drawings, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Whatever you'd like to see, we're prepared to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I was curious as to where all the retail space was going to be because we only, again, only have half in our package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| It must be on the other half, but there is retail proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| The retail, the lot widens as it goes toward Locust from Walnut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| And so the retail is proposed actually on Summer Place but close to the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| so we get to take advantage of the traffic coming off of West Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| And then we've got another position along Locust that will also be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| It's deemed commercial and the whole thing is deemed commercial slash retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| I guess no one else was worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| No, I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Do you have more questions, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| No, I'm approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I just wanted to move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Thanks for bringing your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| I do want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| to negotiate and accept from Knoxville Locomotive Works, Inc. payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| with respect to real and personal property located or to be located at 300 West Quincy Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Mr. Wetzel, you're here eager to tell us a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| I understand this is for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| and I'm trying to get my arms around it a little bit in terms of what actual taxes will be paid that will hit our coffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3215)|
| 0:53:43| as opposed to launch over to pay for some of the cost of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| In short, because this is a pilot, what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| we will be phrasing the taxes where they currently are on both the real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| and there will be a $50 a year increase on the personal property that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| So we're not going to get a lot during the short term except for possibly 50 to 100 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| But the base level taxes still come into the coffers and help pay the bills of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| It's the additional money that helps fund this, in essence, job creation opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with O-Wind Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| DBA Ice Rink Events to lease ice making and ice skating equipment, services and supplies to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| for an amount not to exceed $67,854.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Is Judith here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Judith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I just want to say this has probably been one of the most exciting events that occur on Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| ever since it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| And I thought maybe you might be able to tell us a little bit about how many people we've had in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| and what the future looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| And is this the same cost as it was for last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| It's actually a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| We are entering into another three-year contract with this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| And finance has managed to, I believe, bring the cost down a little bit, probably about $1,000 or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3310)|
| 0:55:20| What were our numbers last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| Because I know when I was down there in the evening, a lot of people were using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| There was a lot of excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I mean, it generates an awful lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Actually, I have some graphs that I could show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| We have the advantage of doing waivers for anyone that is actually skating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| so we can kind of keep up with the head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| Plus, we have the staff counting spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| So it's running, we're close to about 19,000 skaters in the two-month period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| as well as close to probably 8,000 to 10,000 spectators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| So we were down a little bit last year due to the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| We hit almost 20,000 two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| We are predicting to hopefully get it back up to almost 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| We'd love to break the 20,000-person skater mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| Is there still opportunity for sponsors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I just want to make sure people know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Are you volunteering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| Put him down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| We did the very first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| We've got Home Federal has stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| They've been our sponsor for a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| They've come back this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| and we've gone into agreement with them for about two to three consecutive years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| So we've got them as our presenting sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| as well as CBID agreed last night to assist us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| So are you leading council on the skate team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| I will, as long as you're my assistant, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| You do not want me to ice skate, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| Reeve, hockey stars, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| How about Charles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3432)|
| 0:57:13| Charles, will you go with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Okay, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| Roller skate maybe, but not ice skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And if you all want to know, Cool Sports is doing free lessons 12 to 2 on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| The mayor and I will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| I'll need the lessons if I'm going to try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I haven't ice skated since high school, and that was only a couple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| But the key is if we go downtown and drink hot chocolate and watch the others fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| we're still helping the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Then you'll get a lot of laughs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3460)|

| 0:58:20| This is a companion piece to Item 11D, the one that you just passed, related to Walnut Street Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3500)|
| 0:58:30| What you have before you is a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| With the transfer of the property, we will need to expense the city's investment in the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| and in any improvements to the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| And that's what this budget ordinance does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| The funding is coming out of the state street or, excuse me, the metro parking fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| The estimated investment in this piece of property is about $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3542)|

| 0:59:06| but the demolition and getting it shovel ready so we can say, here, developer, start building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3546)|
| 0:59:12| This includes the land acquisition, any improvements to property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| which would include demolition, grading, anything that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| Improvements is what threw me off, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Well, again, that's more of an accounting terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| 12B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2, Section 4-78C of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| relative to due dates of remedial plans and fines for underage beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| This is an ordinance that just tidies up some of the confusion that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| between the date that you pay your fine and the date that you submit your remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| and so it aligns them all to be in a five-day window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| And while I have the microphone, on November 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| the Beer Board will be holding a workshop to explore a number of issues that come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| 12C is an emergency ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 6, Article 1, Section 6-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| to establish the Cumberland Avenue Corridor District as being within the First Fire District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Councilman Dallivante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Yeah, I guess we've got the chief here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| Just tell me, if something is not put over into the First Fire District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| which I think is a technical amendment here, we would have some kind of a gap in terms of enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| What's the consequence of not doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Actually, I think we're going to call on Ann Wallace to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| It has to do with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Good evening, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| He has several trucks, and I won't claim any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Just wanted to let you all know the reason we're doing this is because the C-7 district was currently within the Fire District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| and with changing the zoning ordinance, if we didn't enact this emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| it would no longer be in the Fire District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| and that certainly has regulations and impacts on building and response times and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| So we wanted to make sure that we kept our Cumberland Avenue safe and well covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3682)|
| 1:01:28| This is basically technical housekeeping, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| That's what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Do you need this as an enforcement tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Is that basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Yes, that is a part of it, and this was reviewed by our inspection bureau, and they're good with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Okay, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| Council, I got kind of caught up in all these legal opinions at the start of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| I forgot to mention something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| If somebody wants to make a motion to reconsider, there's one of the pensions on here that you all might want to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3721)|
| 1:02:11| Actually, there are two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| I think if you don't pass that, maybe, yeah, there are two on there that you might want to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| and then maybe those people could not possibly retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| That would be 11N and 11O, and I have to tell you that at the pension meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| we had some debate on whether or not to approve these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| I just want you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| And we did so on the record reluctantly, so we might all want to go on this record going reluctantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| I'll make a motion that we reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| We'd be reluctant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I'll make a motion that we reluctantly approve those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| You can add reluctant to the consent items, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| Chief, do you have a cell downstairs we could put these people in to keep them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| The sheriff does all housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| Okay, so we don't have anybody signed up for public forum, so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you all for coming here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131029?start=3788)|
