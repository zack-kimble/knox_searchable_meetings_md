| 2:38:05| Why don't we just pour concrete and get rid of the bricks and stop dealing with floating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9485)|
| 2:38:10| bricks that keep popping up and leaving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| Is that cheaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9492)|
| 2:38:13| It would be cheaper, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| I'm not sure that would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9494)|
| 2:38:15| In love with the bricks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9495)|

| 2:38:17| But from an aesthetic standpoint and for the ambiance of downtown, I think it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| critical to keep those bricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9499)|

| 2:38:21| and all that stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9501)|
| 2:38:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=9502)|

| 2:47:18| of this proposal is to deal with a change in state law last year effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10038)|
| 2:47:25| July 1st of 2015 the state required that governmental pension plans honor claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10045)|
| 2:47:32| of alternate payees under a qualified domestic relations order and what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| is essentially is is an order that the court will issue during a divorce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10058)|

| 2:47:58| been for years in private plans but governmental plans were not required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10078)|
| 2:48:03| comply with those orders until that law changed while there was a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10083)|

| 2:48:28| going through a divorce and makes it easier for them to divide that marital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160719?start=10108)|
