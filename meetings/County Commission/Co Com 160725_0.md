| 0:00:00| fellow commissioners for your kind attention. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| There's no need to step to the middle of the car just yet because we're not going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=6)|
| 0:00:10| in motion. Commissioner Anders is recognized for a moment of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=10)|
| 0:00:16| Yeah, I kind of want to, thank you Mr. Chairman, I want to reflect a little bit on last month's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=16)|
| 0:00:21| meeting and I've made a, I've had a conversation with Wolfie in private. I'm going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=21)|
| 0:00:27| this public. I wish there were more people here to hear it. In regards to the case, South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=27)|
| 0:00:37| Knox Chapman Highway, I can't think of the name of the restaurant, but Bayou Bay. We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| in my opinion, purely Brad Anders' opinion, we handled that inappropriately by not allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=42)|
| 0:00:50| it to be set off for a month and allowing the officer to testify. And so, I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| to offer a public, I should have voted no or at least objected to the vote, and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| to offer a public apology to Wolfie for not doing that, for the work that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=65)|
| 0:01:10| for us and I, you know, we put one off for a month without the guy being here and Wolfie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=70)|
| 0:01:17| had his, had the need for his detective not being here and we should have put that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| off as well. I'm going to look at some things to check about the testimony because I, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=82)|
| 0:01:28| Sessions Court, it was not thrown out. It was placed on diversion, which is a plea to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| no contest, placed on diversion, so that's totally different than what was testified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| to. And I'm going to look at the testimony of the videotape from last month, but Wolfie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| I apologize for not stopping that and I should have. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=101)|

| 0:08:58| recommendation to commission Captain Mays at B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Okay, I'll call on Captain Wolfie Mays first, see what he has to say, but you have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=544)|
| 0:09:14| The business is closed, so there's no one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Wolfie, have they turned in a license to you or the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| No, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| We've not been able to get in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| Been out there a couple times, no one's there, signs on the door, it says closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Madam Clerk, they have been notified by the former procedure and letters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| Yes, we did send a letter, letters, last month and this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| The letter to the business was returned, but the letter that we sent to their personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| address has not been returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| And I've made several phone calls and left messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Mr. Chairman, you have one of two options, you can get a default judgment for failure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| to show, or you can defer it 30 days and give them one more chance to come and show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| If they're out of business, you know, you usually give them a $1,000 fine, 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| but you know, they are where they are, it's up to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| I'd like to suspend their license pending them returning for a hearing, and that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| if they try to purchase beer from a wholesaler, they won't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Is that correct, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| The motion that is before us is to suspend the license pending their appearing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Do I see or hear further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=652)|

| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Does anyone else wish to comment on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| If not, the motion that is before us is to suspend the license pending their appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Captain Mays, I appreciate you making the attempts by personally going by the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=668)|
| 0:11:19| to get information related to this to present to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| Is there any other action that should take place before the Knox County Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| Mr. Steeley, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=693)|

| 0:12:58| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| I'm honored to be here with my buddy Travis and Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I got that right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| My goal was to make sure I had both names right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Travis and Jennifer, of course, they're here from the air show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| and they just did a wonderful, wonderful job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| and they wanted to make a presentation to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And it was a hugely successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| The Blue Angels and the weather and the people of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I've said many times our biggest asset is our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| and they really came through for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| So, Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Again, I'm here with Jennifer Giffen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| Jennifer and I served as representatives for the air show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| for the five-member partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| which consisted of the Tennessee Air National Guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Knox County government, Blount County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| the city of Knoxville government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| as well as the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| One of my goals in life is never pass up the opportunity to say thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| so I'm here tonight to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| I've got an instrument of that thank you presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| to the partnership designated specifically for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| and that's a commemorative lithograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| It's with regret that I have to say that one of the members of the Blue Angels team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| that did sign this lithograph is no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| In fact, he was fatally injured just a few weeks after the Smoky Mountain Air Show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| in Smyrna, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| So this is in honor of your contributions on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| I'd like to also let you know that we were able to accomplish a few things for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| with the Smoky Mountain Air Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| The first, you've probably seen it in the press by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| but we generated enough revenue to do a donation to Knox Air, forgive me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| Honor Air Knoxville of $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And, again, last Wednesday we were able to announce that we've done a donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=892)|
| 0:15:02| to the family of the departed Captain Jeff Cuss of the United States Marine Corps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| that participated with the Blue Angels in the air show of $25,000 to his heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| Along with that and the other goal that we were able to accomplish is we brought a premier air show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| to East Tennessee for all the public in East Tennessee to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| and we want to thank you for your participation in that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| I did a little research today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| I wanted to add to Travis's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I did a little research today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| We also worked with local nonprofits to work our concession areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| and we were able to donate $75,000 to local nonprofits as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=939)|
| 0:15:51| Again, Jennifer Griffin, Trevor Gardner, and Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| we appreciate your taking time out here to open our meeting this evening with such good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| At this time, I'd like to continue with public forum and recognize Clerk of Courts Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=961)|
| 0:16:13| And I said Clerk of Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Is that what I'm supposed to call you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Should I say criminal court clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Well, technically, because I have three different ones, Clerk of Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| I've been called a lot worse, as you might imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| But thank you for allowing me to be here, Mike Hammond, 8301 Burchell Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=989)|

| 0:17:24| I'm here to say this is the most racist thing I've ever seen in the whole of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| You've got this June the 5th picture of the Sunday paper of Muhammad Ali.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| You put his name up there, real big, and you put a little small, then an obituary-sized picture of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| But then you put his name there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Then you put this picture of a big-ass gorilla that was born at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| To me, that's a slap in the face and the most racist thing I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I went to the funeral that they had in Louisville, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I got an interview with Sports Illustrated with this picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| I got an interview with Associated Press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| China News had a live feed back to China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| They filmed this all the time that they were doing the interpretation of how you are treated, this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| Not only that, the gorilla got a picture of an article on Section E and Section F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Now, you're telling me this couldn't wait until the next day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| And then they're saying it's a week before he turned one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| Muhammad Ali just died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| He was a pleasure to be around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| This gorilla can do them things, but you put the gorilla there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| To me, that tells you how racist this place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| And to show you how even more racist it is, last Thursday, I was going to my doctor's office on 16th and Laura Lane, Laura Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| And as I'm coming up to drive down 16th Street, it's a black SUV, a Ford Explorer, driving slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| She stopped and talked to a guy on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Then she decides she'll drive up to the stop sign, the three-way stop sign in the big red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| And she's trying to make a U-turn, a whole U-turn at a three-way stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| Then I move up to try to turn to go right to get to my doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| She jumps out of her vehicle and leave the door open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Then she decides she wants to turn on her police lights and run to my vehicle and was this close to my face telling me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| do you see you are tailgating me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Can you wait till I decide where I want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| That's what she said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| My heart is beating so fast now, I thought I was another one of them black victims that we've been going through this past summer, in the past years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| And it's sad that this place has to be so racist in our face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| It's very sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I called the Department of Justice right after she left, gave her a description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| I called Sheriff JJ Jones' office, and all they said was we'll talk to her supervisor and let him talk to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1197)|
| 0:20:06| To me, more has to be done about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| She left her door open and ran up to my vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I didn't have time to even react to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| My wife asked me, oh, you didn't take a video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I didn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| That's the last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I thought I was dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| That's the last thing I was thinking about, the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Then they said they're going to pass it to the JJ Jones' office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| They said we're going to pass it to a professor in the standards and let them talk to her supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| I called the FBI here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I called the governor's office in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| I called the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| I called everybody that would hear my cry, because to me, that just adds to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| If I could have been a victim, someone else could have been in that same situation and didn't react the way I reacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| I've been here 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| To show you how racist this place is, I went to a church on Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| I used to go there for about three or four years called Knoxville Christian Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| The preacher, he's sitting up there bad-mouthing Obama about the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| His religion is killing our babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| These liberals are spending our country's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| I didn't complain when George Bush was president, and he couldn't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| Me and another guy, we got our wives, we got out of there and haven't been back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| I went to another church, and they're talking the same stuff about the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| They want to put in this Bible whatever they want us to listen to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| And it's sad, because when I leave here today, I'm going to throw this Bible in the garbage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| and I took my kids out of all churches, and I refuse to go to another church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=1297)|

| 0:42:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| I believe at the work session Commissioner McKenzie had asked the IDB on the attendance record for the two being reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2523)|
| 0:42:15| and I believe was the numbers about for Mr. White was about 50% and Mr. McWhorter about 90%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| Yes, I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I think that was emailed on Wednesday the previous week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2544)|

| 0:42:28| And they were concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2548)|

| 0:42:59| is that two of these people are being, two need to be reappointments and two are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| It can't be four new people or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=2587)|

| 0:52:53| The discussion item coming up next is Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| Discussion by Commissioner Bussler regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| August Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| First of all, I want to say one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| about some of the meetings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| And then I want to get into one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| I've really got two things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| But the first one is, we approve a lot of grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| by just on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| And since we're a self-insured entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| when we pass these grants like we did for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| without questioning, last October we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| approved a grant for $600,000, which I questioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| the superintendent at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| And there were six people that was hired under that grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| that we didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| So we approved six hires that put the county in kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| of liability for their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| And then we don't know what happened to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| if they were continued on hired in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| So I wish that we would just ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| even though we have to do it on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| is there additional hires under those grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| Like today we approved one for over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Are there additional hires to administer that grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| And we just need to know on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| if we're going to do it by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Are we approving hires also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| So I would ask the commission if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| would consider to get that information to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| The second issue I want to talk about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| let me make sure I get this done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| Mr. Chair, we're at the penultimate month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| of the commission year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| And the fact that I will not be here next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| I've asked for this time to say goodbye to four commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Sam McKenzie, Amy Brules, Jeff Oyenbee, and Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| It has been my privilege and pleasure and honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| to sit on this dais with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| I have learned valuable lessons from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| And I hope in whatever your directions or venues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| you decide to choose, that you will be a success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| and achieve the goals that you want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| And again, I just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| for letting me serve with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| And that's it, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Thank you, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Are we down to announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Yeah, we've got one more item on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| Presentation by Rural Metro regarding community protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| class 3, Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3361)|
| 0:56:14| Chief Harnish, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| Thank you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| I'm Jerry Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| My address is 10140 Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| Thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Always glad to see you folks when we have good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| And the good news is the protection class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| for Knox County, or at least a good portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| has improved to class 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| That puts the community in the same class or better class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| than the other suburban communities in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| Depending upon the insurer and the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| being insured, the rate reductions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| caused by going from class 5 to class 3 can be substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3412)|
| 0:56:57| I do want to say that we're proud of the achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| but it's not simply Rural Metro's achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| It is a partnership with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| that we've had for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| As an example, one of the reasons that the class improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| was the addition of the fire station in Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| We would not have been able to put that fire station there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| through our own means, but that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| made possible through the pilot project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| that Knox County approved in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Similarly, the community got improved scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| on the communications center because of a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| by the county in 2011 that all emergency agencies would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| go on to the same computer dispatching system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| Finally, some things that are a little lesser known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| have contributed to protection class improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| not just in Rural Metro's area, but in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| served by other departments in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| For example, the partnership with the County Fire Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| where Rural Metro shares the cost of two public fire safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| In the past, that work was not recognized by us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| but it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| It was reflected in the survey and has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| contributed to an improvement in the classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| So again, we're happy to take credit for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| but the reality is that the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| between Rural Metro and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| is what has generated the success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you, Chief Harnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Would you please stand for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Yes, Chief Harnish, I contacted my insurance carrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| and was told that this did not go into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| until September 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Close, August 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| So a few more days yet, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| It becomes effective August 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| One of the reasons I wanted to have Rural Metro come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| is the last couple months when I was advised of the new rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| system at the different community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| that I've been attending, I've made it a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| to encourage any homeowners that live in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| to contact their insurance agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| to see if they get any kind of savings from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| And I'm happy to report that the one that had saved most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| was a family that lived off of North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| Drive and Pellissippi Parkway in a subdivision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| And their insurance company has told them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| they're going to save over $400 on their homeowner's insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| So in my case, where I contacted my carrier, who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| one of the top five insurance companies in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| because my policy renewed on July 10 of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| and this rating doesn't become effective until August 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| I now have to wait 11 more months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| before I can recoup any savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| But I still don't think that that's quite right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| because once something is in place, it should be active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| But I would encourage everyone in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| that lives within five miles of a Rural Metro fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| and within 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| to call their local insurance agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3607)|
| 1:00:10| and see if they're going to save any money on their homeowner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| policy, because $400 is a significant sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| And I appreciate you guys coming down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Seeing no further questions, Chief Harnish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| thank you for being here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Now then, I almost got us sidetracked a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| Everybody, think of your announcements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| but let me run mine by you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| The next first vote is Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| So I've got to make a note here to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| The next first vote is Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| It must be about time for school to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| because I see Amy Broyles, Commissioner Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| has got new hairdo, a fresh color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| My girls did this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| We all have a different hair color now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| OK, it's noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| And continuing on that line, I'm building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| on what Commissioner Bussler said a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| and speaking now to family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Everyone in this room today is a member of a large family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| That's here we are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| And our family is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| I want to thank everyone that participated today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| worked in the reception that we had earlier this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| for Jill, and for maybe proposed name Maya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| Maybe we've got two months now we're going to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Maybe we may not like that two months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| but we're working on Maya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| And I know we're all looking forward to baby girl's arrival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| Also, I'd like to announce that the mayor will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| host the swearing in of the newly elected county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| officials September the 1st at 9 AM in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| That does not affect our reorganization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| It is the mayor hosting the swearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| in of all newly elected officials in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| September the 1st, 9 AM, this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| The next two things is a pat on the back for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| The National Association of Medical Examiners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| has certified the Knox County Regional Forensic Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| fully accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I think if I remember reading the letter correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| they checked 400 items, and they had an affirmative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| on all 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| The next item that I have is that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| has been notified by the Governing Finance Officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| Association that the, and I will read from their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| that the comprehensive annual financial report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| sometimes we say CAFR, for the fiscal year ending June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| the 30th, 2015, qualifies for a certificate of achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| for excellence in financial reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| The certificate achieved is the highest form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| of recognition governmental accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| financial reporting and is attained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| and its attainment represents a significant accomplishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| by government and its management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3813)|

| 1:03:41| Chris Caldwell, hold up your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| How many years in a row has this been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| This is the 20th year for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| to achieve this certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3833)|

| 1:04:11| Calhoun's on a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| All commissioners attending that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| please notify the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3854)|

| 1:04:20| for how many they will cater the meal to that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3860)|

| 1:04:36| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Before we leave today, I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| to remind everybody that our Knox County Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| does an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| They work very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| And they have got some great early voting places to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| And exercise your right, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| there's 10 early voting locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| But that's through this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| So 10 until 6, Monday through Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| and 10 to 5 on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| And I urge everybody to get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| If not, we will be back for a call to order, roll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| for zonings and such at 7 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| Thank you, my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| This is the zoning portion of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| for the month of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Burroughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Ornby, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| Schoonmaker, Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Bessler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3942)|

| 1:05:49| Commissioner Thomas, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| 10 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| If there be no objection, the last item on the agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| 4P16RZ will be deferred one month to our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| If there be no objection, the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| I say that is because this action for today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| is going to be final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3977)|
| 1:06:17| If anyone is here on 4P16RZ, it will not be heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3977)|
| 1:06:24| It will be heard next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3984)|
| 1:06:33| Mr. Chairman, did the applicant request that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| And they've been missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| This is their third meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Yeah, but he's had some contracts and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| there that require two different zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| and so he's trying to figure something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Is that the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| The last one, 4P16RZ, will be postponed until the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| meeting if there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Also, before we start tonight, it will not be Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| It will be Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4032)|

| 1:09:53| The property is 2.05 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| It came to MPC with a request to RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| The desire is to divide the property into four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| The sector plan shows for low-density residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| or low-density residential designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| The RA zoning fits in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| The Planning Commission recommended approval of RA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4215)|

| 1:10:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| We're excited that we can't build on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| because we don't want to build a long driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| so we're really good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4249)|

| 1:15:33| recommended planning commercial to you at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| They recommended that the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| to General Commercial be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| The matter got before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| And per the state law, you sent the matter back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| to the Planning Commission, initiated your own sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| That was taken up by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| And presumably, I guess reading the tea leaves here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| they recommended approval of the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| And they stipulated that when the zoning came up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| if you consider CA zoning, you should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| attach a series of conditions, which are laying there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| on your desk in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I put those out there earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| It's on about the second page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| There's just about a full page of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| My understanding is the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| is OK with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| And with that, presumably, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| would not have any issue with the property being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| rezoned CA, CAHZ, and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| Councilor King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Members of the commission, there's one other thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| I want to make sure we all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| When they had recommended a planned commercial before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| it was to a depth of 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| As part of the overall discussion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| the plan going back and coming back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| and then the rezoning, the request is for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| and I had understood MPC did not object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| that the property to be rezoned to CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| is all of that property that lies north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| In your packet, there's a map, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| will see we're leaving a portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| zoned as it currently is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| And the rezoning applies only to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| of that property in the application that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| lies north of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| I'm saying it primarily, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| for the benefit of council up there following me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4676)|
| 1:18:05| Mr. King, you're OK with all these conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| in your plan, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Oh, I don't know that I'm necessarily OK with them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| but I'm agreeing to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| You should have asked that a little differently, shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| So the creek is south of the railroad, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4700)|
| 1:18:27| Uh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| The creek's on both sides of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| One's underneath the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It's got to have a railroad bridge to speak to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Come up, sir, and speak to the mic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| You'll have to record that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| The creek comes up all the way up, all the way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| all the way up behind the new Powell Library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| and where Dr. Collier is giving his 10-acre track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Then the creek comes all the way up to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| runs due south from there, goes underneath the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| trestle, and then outlines my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| on the full south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| There's a subdivision where Belinda comes off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| of Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| That's Belinda Road that comes off of Beaver Creek Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| right below the convenience center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4759)|
| 1:19:27| Could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| The historic overlay, according to what we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| got transpired back, I want to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| 2009, the property that the historic home is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| an old Barbara McMurray home, was that's the historic part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| The dirt that it sits on is not the historic part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| So it is legal to move that home, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| the builders, whoever buys it, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| needs the dirt to level up so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| don't have to haul anything in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| So I just need to make that condition clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| And it was made clear to me way back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| I believe it was, or 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| I recognize you as James Sternberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| What's your address, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| P.O. Box 399, High School 37754.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| My question is for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Mr. Kelly, the statement that was made earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| about the depth being only 500 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| where does that leave us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Mr. King's assessment with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| to what is being rezoned is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| It's all the property on the north side of the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| That's, well, let's put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| You can make a motion to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| rezone all the property on the north side of the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| That's how the plan amendment was conceived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| to be the property on the north side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| And with regard to the HZ zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| there is historic zoning already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| As you all know, historic zoning is an overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| And the applicant, when applying for his rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| made that part of his application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| And we believe the HZ should stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| on that one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| Mr. King, do you wish to speak to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| we are right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4901)|
| 1:21:56| And let me see if I have this correct, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| before we get into further discussion between MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| and the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| The sentence reads right now, toward the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| of the sentence, historic overlay and floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| zoning for the entire parcel, and rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| the remainder of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| And the rest of that sentence to be struck, that's the 500 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| Where are you reading that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| I'm reading recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Recommend the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| approve PC planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| PC planned commercial slash historic overlay and F floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| zoning for the entire parcel, 056EC007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| and rezone the remainder of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| The action of the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| was to approve general commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| general commercial designation for all of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| on the north side of the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| And if it is your desire to rezone that property to CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| then your motion should be to rezone only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| that portion of the property north of the railroad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| to CA, floodway, and CA slash HZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| Those are the three elements of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| Mr. Chairman, if you will, that takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| the place of that recommendation that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| on your printed agenda, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| That recommendation that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| it was a result of the Planning Commission's action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| back months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| And since the rezoning didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| to go back to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| like the plan amendment did, you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| got the original recommendation from the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| And the clerk has captured your words a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| and they're ready to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| And a part of the motion that we may have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| With the conditions, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| Right, with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5060)|
| 1:24:31| This question is for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| If you would look at the maps that you presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| this evening, the one that says North County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| Amendment, there's a carve out above the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5078)|
| 1:24:45| And then on the second map that was submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| it's not carved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Is there some difference in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5090)|
| 1:24:57| One map is called North County Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| The other one says Letter Portrait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| You see down by the railroad tracks, there's a carve out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5105)|
| 1:25:21| So I guess my question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| The Letter Portrait map is a map that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| was made at the time they were doing the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| and it's the outline of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| there that is most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| The heavy, dark line that's around the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| OK, on the North County Sector Plan Amendment map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Letter Portrait has a, you see a heavy, dark line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| That's a map that was made, presumably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| at the time they applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| And it just shows you the area that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| were requesting a change on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| If you look at the map that says North County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| Amendment, that was the map that was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| during the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| OK, so that is all the property then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| north of the railroad then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| Commissioner Busler, do you have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| for any of these presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Mr. King, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| We've got some things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Now, are you comfortable with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| is being given here tonight about the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| Because this was worked out by the community and Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Sternberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Is your client comfortable with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Let me ask you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| My client advises me that he is OK with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| This was a product of meeting with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| I think you were involved, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| in some of those meetings and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| with MPC representatives, including Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| And this is what everybody, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| it sort of solved everybody's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And I'm going to say, for the purposes of this hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| I'm comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| We tried a different zoning a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| and we spent 10 years trying to do something with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| and it never worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| We're hopeful that this change will allow us to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| the opportunity to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| And so we wanted to keep happiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| in the family of neighbors, and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| these conditions resulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| OK, so Madam Clerk, you have a copy of all these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| It's got the conditions in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| You just went by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| We've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5288)|
| 1:28:08| So you've got all the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| Before the zoning session started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| I laid a copy on Angie's desk there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| that it says Knox County Commission 4E16SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| And on the second page, adopt resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| And underneath that, there are a list of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| And those are the conditions that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| OK, so from my understanding of what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| what our clerk has in her hands is agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| that we all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| So I know we've got another question down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| by Mr. Brown, but I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Let's see if Commissioner Brown has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| a question of the presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Yeah, I'd like to go back for a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| and talk about this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| You said the house was historic, but the ground under it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| So Mr. Law Department, weigh in on that if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| Well, there's an overlay of regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| that would apply to that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| This body is not going to enforce those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| And it's not, by my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| what the applicant's asking for, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| this body's not going to change those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| So they would continue to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| whatever he mentions about the house and the ground under it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| would be enforced by the Historic Zoning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| But you're not being asked to change those regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| So I guess my final question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| can he move the house and flatten it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| I'm not familiar with the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| of the house and the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| I'm generally familiar with the historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| I can say that is an overlay of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| It may depend on the age of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| It may depend on the specific architectural characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5417)|
| 1:30:17| But I'm not familiar enough to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| I'm sorry, I didn't hear his full question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| What was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| My question was, John, you mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| about moving the house because you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| needed the dirt underneath it to level out the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Is that allowable under the historic overlay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| I believe there's a process by which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| the house, which is the historic structure, can be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| I'm not personally that familiar with it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| I think Dr. Sternberg may have had some discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| with the Historic Zoning Commission on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| I don't know whether that subject was covered or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| We're leaving it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| We're not taking it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| So we're going to be stuck with whatever they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| I thought this process included it had to be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| because you needed the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| But my question then would be, I guess, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| is that if we approve this as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| and they go to move the house, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| does that come under codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| I want to be sure that we're all dancing to the same music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| In the jurisdiction of the Historic Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| I think what the important part is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| the action that you take today will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| change the regulations regarding historic home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Those regulations will continue in full force and effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| I live in an area with a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| And we've been able to move homes, houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| from lot to lot that are covered by historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| So I know that that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| And I believe that it's the Historic Zoning Commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| ultimately approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| And we've had huge houses that we've moved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| not just a few lots or blocks away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| but from neighborhood to neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| So it's definitely possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| And I believe it's the Historic Zoning Commission that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| ultimately gives the go ahead for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| But it definitely can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Are there any other questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Are we ready to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| First of all, before I make my motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| I want to say that Dr. Sternberg and the community out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| worked very long and very hard to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| a compromise between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| And I want to thank Dr. Sternberg for his efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| to help support the community and protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| So anyway, I want to make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| that we accept with these regulations, the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| regulations, our MPC motion that includes these conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5592)|
| 1:33:20| for that property and has to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| as general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| Actual zoning classification, it would be CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| How's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5617)|

| 1:33:41| Seeing no further discussion, we have before us a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5621)|
| 1:33:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5627)|
| 1:33:47| My understanding of this is not per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| This is per the applicant's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| Per the applicant's request for CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| for all of that property lying north of the railroad track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5638)|
| 1:34:06| So now how do I have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| But the sentence of the motion, though, was read to us by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Dan, do you want to take another stab at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| Maybe an appropriate motion would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| be to recommend or move to approve CA general business, CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5661)|

| 1:34:44| amendment that was discussed at your last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| I didn't quite get all that, but can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| I want to make Dan Kelly's motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| to make it appear to come out of my mouth that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| Anyway, I will make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| I want it to appear that it came out of your mouth, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5704)|

| 1:36:10| Ma'am, if you would please pull the microphone down so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| that you can speak and give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5773)|

| 1:36:19| My name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| My name is Frances Waddell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5781)|

| 1:36:29| 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5792)|
| 1:36:32| Just a second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| Seeing none, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| This property is already zoned planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Need the sector plan amendment to general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| in order to be able to rezone the property to the CA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| The logic there is that the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| is so small under the planned commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| I don't know that you could put anything on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| based on the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| So a change to CA in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| would allow for the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| I'd like to make a motion to approve per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5832)|

| 1:38:12| This is a peace property that's already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5894)|

| 1:38:33| Thank you, Ms. Waddell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| Can I just ask him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5915)|

| 1:38:51| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Or did you all get some kind of letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| that said it was a different time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| The letter that she received was from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| It did not have a time on it, but it said it was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| And the only date it had was up in the left-hand corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| which was the hearing for the last time she came up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5950)|

| 1:39:34| before zoning of this Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5974)|
| 1:39:43| And the question that was asked, the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| is postponed until the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=5985)|

| 1:40:14| Jolie and Drew don't want to take any more out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| of their pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=6016)|

| 1:40:51| If you would individually, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| talk to the commission office about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160725?start=6052)|
