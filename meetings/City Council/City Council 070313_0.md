| 0:02:43| some of the details of it before it got considered here and I wasn't able to set that up so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| going to ask we put this off and apologize to the folks who live there who've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=168)|

| 0:04:31| whichever number that is. That is 11K and we would move that to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| we'll move that right after the elections and confirmations if that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| Motion to second. Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=283)|

| 0:04:49| The item that Mr. Becker, we also had a resolution to honor the Lady Roadrunners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| They're going to actually come to the next city council meeting two weeks from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| so we will celebrate the Austin East girls team two weeks from now and we'll do that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| 6A is an application for renewal of a retailer certificate for Lori Jill Elmore Gettlefinger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=305)|

| 0:05:24| DBA Southern Wine and Spirits, LLC, 211 West Young High Pike. Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=324)|
| 0:05:30| Questions here? All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| I have nothing further in the mayor's report. Any reports from council members? Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Yeah, I wanted to talk for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| I guess I asked Mr. King what's happening with the county stormwater ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| and especially the study the county and the city worked on together about reviewing the county stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| Can you fill folks in on where that's at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Yes. We have gotten a draft report from Arcadis, the consultant that's doing that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| and there's a joint meeting between city engineering, county engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and Arcadis scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| And as you know, council knows, there is in the contract a public meeting to be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| We would anticipate that after the report is reviewed again and reissued by Arcadis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=382)|
| 0:06:31| that that public meeting will be scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| One of the things just, I guess, to say, remind folks about when this was originally talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| one of the ideas that was discussed is a joint city council county commission public meeting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| Has there been any discussion about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| or is that something we should get the vice mayor to talk to the chairman about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| All I'm aware is that there will be a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| It could take on several different forms, but however council wishes, we would pursue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| When the time is appropriate, if you'll remind me, I'll be glad to reach out to the commission chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=431)|

| 0:07:18| Could you give the public another update on how everyone is recuperating, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=438)|

| 0:07:29| He's looking forward to get back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| James Rickett, as I said before, he'll be back to work on restricted duty in a couple of weeks probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| And the rest of my men that were injured are all back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=461)|

| 0:07:50| Yes, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| First of all, most of the council remembers that the city and the task force set up for the James White Parkway did a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=471)|
| 0:08:00| A couple of years ago or so, Councilman Woodhull and I co-chaired the second James White Parkway task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| And TDOT is having two meetings on the 27th of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| One is for local officials here in the small assembly room at 1 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| And the other is a public meeting at 5 o'clock at the South Doyle Middle School Commons and Auditorium area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=501)|
| 0:08:29| to talk about where they're at with the environmental impact statement, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| So I want to make sure that the public was aware and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| the council is aware of the public officials meeting here at 1 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| and then the public meeting at 5 at South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| The other thing is, and council, of course, is aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| some of the people in the audience and the television audience may not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| the Plain Talk on Quality Growth Conference comes up the 29th and 30th of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| The conference itself, which is, there's a charge for attending the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| It's targeted towards people who are in leadership positions in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| but that can be any leadership position, neighborhood, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| If you're engaged at all in your community at any level, then you're encouraged to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| On the 29th, there will be a free session open to the public at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| and the Baker Center for Public Policy at UT is hosting that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| And that's at 7 o'clock, I believe, at the University Center Auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Any other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=581)|

| 0:10:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Gary Underwood's not here, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| I don't see Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| It's very unusual and difficult to win a state championship in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| So unusual that until this year, I think I'm right on this, Sam Anders can probably correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| there had never been a girls team in Knox County that's won a state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| And then in about a week period, we had two teams win it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| So it's very significant and unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I'd love to ask the web lady Spartans to come on forward so that we could recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| And while you're coming, I will tell our audience here and both on TV a little bit about why this is so special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| if you all will come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| I was tracking this game on the Internet, and with about two minutes to go, unless I'm wrong, girls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| I think you all were losing by about nine points with two minutes to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| And that didn't look so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| But thanks to a never-say-die attitude and some great play by some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| they ended up winning by two points and bringing home the first girls championship in Knox County history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| So I think it's very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Coming up the steps right now, I should also point out is Shelly Sexton Collier and three of her five girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| Some of you might remember Shelly when she was Shelly Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Twenty years ago, she brought home the first national championship for the Lady Vols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| or was the captain of that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| And so I think it's particularly poignant that she would be the coach of the first Knox County girls team to win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| in that kind of 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| That's really significant, and we want to salute you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| And where is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Gloria Johnson here voted Miss Basketball for the state of Tennessee and also was the tournament MVP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| It says a lot about her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| But this is a special group of girls made up of, I think, three seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| I think there's some freshmen that play, sophomores, juniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| It's a great mix of girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| And, like I said, to win a state championship is no easy task, and we are proud of all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| And on behalf of the city of Knoxville, we want to congratulate you on your achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| and wish you good success next year as well, and thank you for the way you represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Not only did you win, but I think you did it with great class and character, and that makes it mean even more to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| So I'm going to ask some other folks to come join us for a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| I have some, I'm not sure who seniors here are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| I'll give those to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| We'll ask everybody to kind of maybe squeeze in this picture some, if you can push in some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=764)|
| 0:13:00| I can't see Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Where'd you go, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=782)|
| 0:13:12| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| I would like to thank, on behalf of our coaching staff and these young ladies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| what a privilege it is to be here with you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| And we certainly are proud to represent Knoxville, and we thank you once again for honoring us in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| It is very special to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| So thank you for taking the time to do this, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Thanks, Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=821)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you, girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| I'm sure you're going straight home to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| As a cautionary tale, if you all go to Webb, if you're not careful, you might end up like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| No, I won't say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Congratulations again, girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| 10A is an appeal by Amy Leslie for the South Haven Neighborhood Association of the Board of Zoning Appeals decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| to approve a variance to reduce Gilbert Lane front yard setback from 25 feet to 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| Article 4, section 2.E.1.A, as per site plan, to construct a residence in an R1 low-density residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| property located at 2242 Price Avenue, in conjunction with 11I, which is a resolution approving the appeal of Amy Leslie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Any questions or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Are there people here on both sides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| Amy Leslie is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| I don't know if the original applicant for the variance is here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| I can talk a little bit about this and give you some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| We have no one signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| I mean, given how often this has been postponed, I would feel really bad about doing this when nobody was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| But, I mean, please, reassure me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| I'd love to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| And I have the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| The problem is that this has been going and going, and there is a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| And we have, as Leslie and myself have met with the original applicants for the variance, Melanie and Cotter Sacala, and great folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=942)|
| 0:15:57| And they had a very marginal lot that no one's ever built on because it's so marginal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| And the original plan they had that BZA approved, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| and the house plan that they presented to us was not something that really worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| The house would literally, the roof would be all you'd see from the street, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| And they said, well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| We'll rework the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| We've met with them a couple of times in morning meetings at Shoney's and very congenial meetings and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| And they kept putting it off, saying we're not, we just can't deal with it now, we're not ready, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| And here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| I'm not sure if we can postpone this again without running out of the time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| I think there's a, Mr. Swanson, is there a 120-day limit on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Actually, the 120-day time limit has to do with rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| There's no limit on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| There really is not a time limit that I'm aware of that applies to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I misunderstood then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Under those circumstances, if council wants to postpone again, we can postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1016)|
| 0:17:04| We can just keep postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| And I don't have a problem with postponing it again if that's council's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1026)|
| 0:17:15| I'd like to see them come up with a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| That just hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| Go ahead, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Was the applicant, I guess in this case, were they aware that this was being heard tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1044)|
| 0:17:32| I believe they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| They were told that it was postponed the last time for four weeks, and so I believe they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| But that doesn't mean that they didn't get it on their calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| You know, that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I guess I share Councilman Becker's concern that everybody have a fair hearing on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| and I just want to make sure that if the opponent to this appeal wanted to be here that they had a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| And I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| You know, certainly a motion to postpone takes precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| or I can withdraw the motion to approve either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| But since we're not facing the 120-day time limit, I wasn't aware that that was the technical breakdown on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| you know, that we're OK legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| So, you know, I'll withdraw my motion to approve if someone wants to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| I'm not sure who seconded your original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Mr. Bailey, are you willing to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| I'll withdraw, and then I'll make a motion to postpone for two weeks, and we'll just see what happens in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| It's been withdrawn, and a second has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| And I've moved to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| For two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| And just as a courtesy, can you make sure you've talked to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I did, and I withdrew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Well, is there a motion to second to the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| And I heard Mr. Becker say, let's just make sure that both sides are here and represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1156)|

| 0:19:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| I have spoken with the applicant about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| I've also spoken with Dr. Lyons about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| And I guess I have a few concerns that we're getting the cart before the horse with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| when we're so close with our downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I think they're trying to put together a really good plan, but I also would like to see further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| discussion about how their plan fits in with our proposed design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| And I don't know whether anybody else shares my concerns with that, but I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| propose a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Buzz, do you want to come speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Well, there hasn't been a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Well, I mean, I would, I guess, I'd almost prefer to see if we can deal with that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| Do you feel like it would take more time than we have tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Because I share your concerns about how it fits with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| We'll say that wasn't a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Let's have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| That motion's floating out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Buzz, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Buzz Goss, 121 South Gay Street, and my partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Jeffrey Nash, 3012 Whispering Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| I guess we'll let questions from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Mr. Goss and I spoke on the telephone yesterday about his project, and we talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| design guidelines that we're going to consider later on in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| And I explained to Mr. Goss that one of my concerns was not having a clear handle on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| visually how the two-story addition to this building is going to affect the appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| of the buildings, both from the front elevation where it's stone on the lower portion, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| then on the north elevation where it's brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Because the additions on the top two floors are a different building material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And I was able to get the more detailed plans from Dr. Lyons, so that was helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| There's also the issue of a setback on the upper stories, and Mr. Goss and I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| There is a setback on the north elevation, but there's not a setback on the Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| And again, that's something that's addressed in the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So I guess I just expressed to you yesterday that I need more information to feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1346)|
| 0:22:33| that what we're approving the tax increment financing to support on the renovation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| this building is in keeping with our intent going forward with our design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| So do you want to address the issue of setback or building materials or any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I think what we have done is what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| Let me step back and give you a little bit of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| I lived in this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Well, I developed this building originally in 1997 and was living in it at the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| it burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| And the next day I was thinking, okay, it'd be nice to redevelop this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And that's been two years and almost a month now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| So we've been in process for 27 months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| And the first goal that we had was to try to just redevelop the building as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| Well, it turns out that the economics of construction have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| And at the same time, the cost because of the fire have pushed it beyond the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| of developing the building just as a size it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| We first approached the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I think we've met with Dr. Lyons and Mayor Haslam about what kind of opportunities there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| might be to help us bridge the gap that is to make the building work in its current configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| And it's obvious that there really was no funds available for that kind of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| And so then we first looked at, well, let's add one floor to the top of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| And we tried to work out the most economical way to construct that and the one that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| fit the building the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| And we had a plan that would involve some support from the CBID and other places, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| TIF financing, as we're here for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| And the CBID, in their wisdom, decided that they couldn't match the funds that were necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| not just to make the building feasible for us, but really bankable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| That is, the banking institutions want a certain amount of ROI, and we just couldn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| And so then we had to step back again and figure out another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| And that plan was to actually go ahead and add a second floor to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Having the economics drive us to that point, we then tried to make the best decisions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| terms of an architectural perspective, but at the same time, try to respect the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And as it turns out, we originally looked at trying to set it back from the Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| However, two stories is still going to be visible from the sidewalk, unless you're standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| directly under the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| It's ambiguous as to where that really matters, where you're looking from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| However, it was not possible to set the building back for some construction reasons and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| water mitigation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| The material that we're intending to use on the upper level of the building mimics the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| stone on the front of the building as closely as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| That is, that we couldn't put the weight of new stone up there, but we could do a cementitious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| stucco that really matches the color and even the texture and the block work of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| existing stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| And it simply makes sense, from my perspective as an architect, to wrap that around the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| That is, so it looks like this piece that is the new top of the building, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| And that's not without precedent in Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| The Holston building was only, I think, 12 stories tall originally, and they added two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| more stories on the top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| And they did their best to try to mimic and make the building appear complete when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| finished it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| The Burwell building is, I don't know if you know, I'm the architect on that renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| and that building is twice as big as it was originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| So there's precedent for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| And while we might maybe change the color of the stucco or something like that on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| side to match the red brick, the idea of stepping back at the front really doesn't work from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| a lot of perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| And I would be glad to explain that in greater detail if you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Mr. Goss, what's the age of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| The building as you see it now is about 70 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| However, prior to that, it was two separate buildings that were then taken and reconfigured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| and a new facade put on it and made it look like a singular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So the greater history is it's about 100 years old, and it's burned twice, by the way, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| its history, and we plan to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| One more question, then I'll let other council members fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| I noticed in the drawings that there are skylights on top of the new, I believe it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| the new fifth story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| And they look like box kind of skylights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Do you know what the dimensions of those are in terms of looking at the roof line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Are they four feet or eight feet or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| You mean in plan or in height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| In height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Oh, they would just barely be above the existing, the new roof surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| So they might be 12 inches or 14 inches above the finished roof surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| Okay, so they're not big, tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| That's right, and they're also hidden behind a parapet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| The roof has to slope, and it makes sense to slope it north to south, and so we put a parapet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| up around that so you wouldn't see the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| It would look much like the top of the buildings that you see in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| And the protrusion out over Gay Street that comes out from the top, and we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| this yesterday, too, and I'm still a little bit confused about that, that comes off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| top of the roof at the new fifth story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Does that come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Does that cast shadow over the sidewalk on Gay Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| It looks in the drawing as though it comes out further than the front setback of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| It comes out like the cornices along Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| It has different depths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I'm trying to match sort of the character of the building and the original primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| secondary, and tertiary orders of the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| It also is a slight nod to the corner piece that was done on One Vision Plaza across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| So it's almost like bookending the entry or exodus from Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| I'll let some others jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| I'm going to go to Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| I'm not sure whose light was next, but we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Probably was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Well, because I wanted to comment that I did have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Buzz, I didn't speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| But I did have the opportunity to speak to Mr. Nash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| And, of course, the future of this building has been something that every time I'm in town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| I'm thinking about hopefully someone is going to have a vision for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| and be in a position to move on seeing it once again, as you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| be a wonderful bookend to the north entrance of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And so I guess while I intend to support the downtown guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| because I think it is just absolutely critical to the future of Knoxville and to the streetscape, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| however, the opportunity to have someone who I believe will take this into heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1752)|
| 0:29:23| and make it the kind of structure that we really are looking forward to it once again becoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| even better for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| You know, I really think I understand a lot of the complications of trying to reconstruct this building in a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1770)|
| 0:29:41| and to take care of some of the issues that were all uncovered during this last fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| And I know that's very costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| And my concern has been when is someone going to be willing to embrace that, deal with those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| and go to the expense to do it in the way that we would all be excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| So, you know, it's really my sense that we need to assist them in moving on with their plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| and particularly because I don't understand a lot about financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| but I know the banks will really tie you to many details in order to approve the kind of financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1815)|
| 0:30:24| that you're going to need for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| So it's just kind of my feeling that I want to say congratulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| thank you so much for the two years of work that you've already put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| And, you know, I really look forward to seeing this once again as a really we're getting so much done downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| This is just one more piece of it that it will be so exciting to see it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| So I'm inclined not to rush things and not to get the cart before the horse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| but to go ahead and let the cart and horse start running so that we can all see the finished product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| And if I may go back and address an issue that I think you raised, Councilman Rodley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| I guess it requires a bit of leap of faith that what we're going to put up there is going to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| good for the building, good for Gay Street, good for the community, but also good for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| the people who are going to live in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| And quite frankly, I intend to buy a unit as well as both of my partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| And it will be my home in downtown, and so I want it to be the best that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| Again, that's a leap of faith, and I can understand, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| the concern given that we're talking about design guidelines a little later in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| But I would ask you to look at our track record, and you might not be aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| but we have been involved either as architect or developer or both in 40-some-odd buildings in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| And I don't think you could point to any of them and say, oh, they messed up or, oh, it looks horrible now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| We did a building in downtown Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| It was six stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Now it's seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| And it was the first large loft condominium project there, and it sold out immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| It was very popular, and people are very happy for the work that we did over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1918)|
| 0:32:01| I'm grateful to be in the position that I'm in, and I actually look forward to redeveloping this building again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| So I appreciate your support, and thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Well, I'll just make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| You know we'll be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| So, I mean, you know, I just think you know that we're very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| You know we're interested in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And as a council, as a city, as a community, we'll be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And we are grateful for what you've invested in your time and your creativity in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| And that's the reason I feel the confidence in supporting you in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I guess, Mr. Goss, I think some of what you just said about sort of leap of faith and trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| in a way design is something I'm not even close to very good at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I mean, what things look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Sometimes when I'm dressed well and people compliment me, I just say it was an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| You know, it just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| When did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| My light is on, yours isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| So I'm glad you're doing this, and I have a tendency to trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I wanted actually to ask Mr. Lyons a question, and then sort of one for both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| I guess, you know, Mr. Lyons, you're actively involved in this and actively in the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| Do you have some feeling about why this is a good idea and how this is going to fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| And do you want to just sort of, again, convince me this is a good design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Again, we are involved in this and the design guidelines and strongly support both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| And I guess, first of all, I don't really see a contradiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| I think one element of the design guidelines, to get into some of the conversation we had even on the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| they have to be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And I think if we – and they have to – and they're going to be evaluated by a board that uses words like normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| and toward goals and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| This is a very – as Bob said, this is a real special case, first of all, with some overriding economic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| And I think given that, I'm convinced the building is just plain not developable in its present contour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| And I guess I would say that I don't see this as violating the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| but it coming up – bumping up against some of the concerns expressed in the design guidelines for a review board to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| And I think the addition of stories is something you would want a review board to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Now, I guess we're all sort of serving as that review board right now prior to this being appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| And in our looking at it carefully, we're convinced this is the best outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| And it's also basically, I guess, in my mind, the triumph of just the concept of pragmatism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| I think in order not to have the perfect, I don't see another solution to this but a remaining hole on one of our key corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| And that's just not anything I would want to look forward to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| and eventually the building having to be taken down completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| So, you know, the fire obviously complicated it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I guess I'm convinced that the scale of the building will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| The quality of the construction will be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| It isn't ideal, all things which the design guidelines speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| but I think it's the best solution to a complex set of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| And what I hope would demonstrate to people that the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| that the concept and the thinking that goes into those does allow for flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| and special cases to overcome some of the fears people have that we'll be putting something excessively rigid in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| Let me just, just one, and I think that you sort of answered my follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| I guess both of you sort of understand the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| If this was six weeks from now and we had adopted the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| this would be something you would see as sort of, and this isn't exactly the terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| but that the review board would look at, and I don't know if it would grant a variance or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| and would say, no, this doesn't fit exactly what it is, but it's within the scope of, it's something we'd consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| That's sort of how this would fit if it was six weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Mr. Donaldson, notice this area is zoned C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| That's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| I mean, are there, is there any reason why this would be coming in front of MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| Have you had the opportunity to see the plans, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| I viewed it online with your new agenda review technique, which was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| That's the first that I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Yeah, it's properly zoned and platted, and next step is a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Any setback issues for the addition or balconies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2190)|
| 0:36:39| No, there is a requirement in C2 that if you're building new, there would be a five-foot setback from the edge of the street right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2199)|
| 0:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| They're using the existing footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| That's not a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Slightly changing gears, I see you're listed as one of the staff members for the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| For downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| As you see it, is this, would this pass right now, pass the design guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| It would get one vote, mine, I know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| And, again, it is the same argument that Mr. Lyons made, that this is an extraordinary case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| and I think the only viable option other than this is tearing down the building, starting fresh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| So our concern is with just the Gay Street Historic District as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| and maintaining the numbers of historic structures that are still integral in order to satisfy the Secretary of the Interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2257)|
| 0:37:46| and protect the 25% tax credit options that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| And I think we've got some room to move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Ms. Roney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Mr. Donaldson, I assume that the changes being made to this building don't affect its status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| as a part of your historic inventory in the Gay Street Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| I think it might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| The Secretary of Interior's standards are pretty explicit about adding stories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| so it could lose its standing as a contributing building to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| So the argument that if we tear it down, we lose one, I mean, if we change it, we lose one too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| I was just going to say a couple of weeks ago my wife and I was driving down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| and I drove by that building and I looked over at her and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| you know, I'd be glad when somebody does something with this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| You know, I was really concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| and I think what you've put forward here gives an opportunity, and based on your track record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| I think you'll do a good job with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| an opportunity to put this piece of property back in circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| And I think what you've done and what you're trying to do is going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| and I'm glad to hear what Bill Lyons says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| that he doesn't think it is inconsistent with the guidelines and that they should be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| I've got some questions later on about the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| but I think that what you're proposing, Buzz, is something that I can be supportive of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and I'm glad to see that building, which has been sitting there for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| kind of come back online, and hopefully we'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| I can see both sides of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| and I share the concerns of some of my colleagues on sort of getting ahead of the design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| but this is an extraordinary situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| As has been pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| an historic asset to the downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| and if extraordinary measures aren't taken, this building is not going to be salvaged, it appears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| And I guess to me that's sort of the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| If it were new construction or some substantially different circumstances similar to new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| then I would probably lean in the direction of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And I think in this case I'm going to have to vote to move ahead on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| But I do appreciate the need for putting the guidelines in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| especially concerning new construction and any new construction further down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| But this one is, to me, this just barely tips over in the other direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| not that it's an easy decision for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| I want to ask Mr. Goswin's work to be in an earnest on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Assuming that you're able to assist us with the TIF financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| we are anticipating being able to close our construction funding in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Is that correct, Jeffrey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| In April and shortly thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Okay, ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2463)|

| 0:42:57| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| I think that's a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| and it's probably one that may have been more appropriate back when we passed this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| and I didn't have time to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| But, you know, as I was reading through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| one thing that jumped out in my mind, and maybe the police chief or I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| maybe MPC can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| With regards to intentional versus unintentional false alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| what does the Code say to that, or do we discern between those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| It kind of jumped out at me, too, it's very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| By unintentional versus intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| sometimes false alarms occur through no fault of the particular property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| And I don't know, I don't remember how we addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| if someone could refresh my memory, or is that going to be a discretionary kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| or is it mandatory that tickets be written after two false alarms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| I have visions of little kids grabbing phones and dialing numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and hanging up and running through the house and parents not knowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| and you look up and there's a fire department, and that happens on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| Chief Owen, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| This ordinance requires callbacks, so that eliminates that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I was just going to comment, when that was originally considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| there was a lot of discussion about that, because there's a lot of equipment failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| there are just a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| I mean, I just spent my morning this morning dealing with a problem at our house with the security system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| And so I recall that we tried to make every assurance that it was not a problem for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| who are having serious problems, but it is a problem for the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| in that it takes up so much manpower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| and so people need to be urged to correct their issues if they have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| And I appreciate the Chief's response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| I just could remember what we had done to, what was our safeguard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2684)|

| 0:45:37| Ellen, if you'd like to give us your name and address and speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| My name is Ellen Zaviska.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| The pronunciation was right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| I live at 3118 Fairview Street in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| and I'm the president of the Whittlesprings-Bellmorris Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| This is an older neighborhood with many beautiful homes that's recently reorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| Unfortunately, we also have some newer housing more recently constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| that doesn't quite fit in in terms of the setbacks of the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| and the orientation of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| But this is something people are concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| and we have agreed to pursue the infill housing overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| and we encourage Council to approve this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And we'd also like to invite anyone who's interested to come to our regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2783)|

| 0:46:51| 11J is a resolution requesting and encouraging Governor Phil Bredesen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| and other appropriate state officials to release to 911 centers statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| including Knox County, $14 million in fees generated by cell phone users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| as previously authorized by the Tennessee Emergency Communications Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| requested by Council Member Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2828)|

| 0:47:10| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I'd like to be added as a cosponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2832)|

| 0:47:14| Same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Bob Coker has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Bob, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Do you want to give us just the 30-second version of why this is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| and what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| It obviously can impact the city in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Thank you for letting me speak, Mr. Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| The bottom line comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| You might tell who you are and your position, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Bob Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| I'm Bob Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| I'm the Director of the Knox County Emergency Communication District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| better known as E911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| When 911 came into existence in 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| it had a good funding model based on the traditional landlines coming into your homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| and into businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| As technology progressed, a little thing called a cell phone came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| We started getting rid of the traditional landlines going to the cell phones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| which is great except the tariffs on that, the $1 tariff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| goes to Nashville rather than staying here in our community to support the 911 system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| They return 25% of that money to the 100 districts across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| That 25% does not mean 25 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| We actually get about 14 cents here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Some other counties get quite a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Actually, small counties get about twice as much as the larger counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| As cell phones increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| more and more people are taking their landlines out of their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and out of their businesses, going to voice-over the Internet protocols| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| or using cell phones exclusively, our money goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| In the last four years, the board, the state board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| has only returned $34 million during that total, during that four years, back to the local ECDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| During that time, they returned $71 million back to the cell phone companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| They still have a $49 million surplus or reserve fund sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| For the last year and a half, I've been fighting to get some of that money back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| They agreed to do it, and then they backed away from doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| And your support is so very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| It's also critical to get the governor and the governor's staff to realize that money is not state money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2967)|
| 0:49:35| That's money paid by our citizens, collected by the state, and it should be returned back here to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| I just want to say I've been following this in the press lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Obviously, it's an important issue because many people obviously rely on 9-1-1 for, you know, emergency services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2986)|
| 0:49:54| and we can't have our local system put in a financially precarious position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| So I think this is something important to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| I appreciate the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| You're 100% right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| I just wanted to ask, Mr. Coker, you say that they agreed to return the money and they've reneged on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| At first, during this year and a half, they would not even consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| We stayed in their face constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| I think I spent more time than they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Who is they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| They being the Tennessee Emergency Communication Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| After a series of fact findings, meetings, et cetera, they finally agreed that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| operationally that money needs to come back, and especially when I pointed out the specifics of the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| that says that surplus money would come back to the locals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Rather than giving us $49 million, they did agree to share $14 million across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| And after agreeing to do that and a board vote to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| we received notice that four minutes after two on a Friday afternoon that the money was not in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| It was not budgeted money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| It's a reserve fund from this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| And where is that fund, that $49 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| $49 million is a set-aside fund, a reserve fund for the Tennessee Emergency Communication Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| that can only be used for 911 services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I'd like to add my name to the sponsor list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| I think we'll take all of counsel then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| And I appreciate the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| It is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Chief Owen, that uniform has thrown me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| One thing I do want to point out, that of the $14 million in total for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| about $918,000 would come to Knoxville, not the whole $14 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| but to the Knoxville district we get $918,000 approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Mr. Coker, was that agreement, did it involve only Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| or did it involve the entire state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| It involved the total of 100 911 centers scattered across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| Everybody would be getting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| We would be getting basically 33 percent of our audited costs back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| The smaller counties would be getting up to 67 percent of their audited costs back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So surely they're making noise too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Not as much as I wish they were, and not enough right now, to put it mildly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| And that's why Mr. Frost bringing this resolution up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| and the mayor's strong support that he has shown us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| is just so critical to let the people know that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| in Nashville the money needs to be back where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| What reason did they give you for having this money set aside in a reserve fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| and only dispersing a portion of it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| I wish I had an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| There was no reason for not returning, as the state law says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| the excess monies back to the local ECDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| They had money that they said they had recurring costs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| for payment to the cell phone companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| They just had two or three different just vague reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| they were wanting to put in a different system across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| their operating funds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| But they did, after a compromise, they came down to $14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| And this was a year-and-a-half long project for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| Margie, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| One of the other reasons they gave is they, the governor said he felt like that money should be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| for big infrastructure projects that affect the whole state instead of giving it out among 100 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| I'm not justifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| That's just what he, one of the reasons they gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Councilman Hawquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3222)|

| 0:53:47| What's the total annual budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| When I came here, our total budget was $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| I've reduced it down to $6.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3234)|

| 0:56:55| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Yeah, I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| I didn't think of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| I wrote it down, but I didn't actually think to ask you, Mr. Donaldson, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| This applies only on overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| What would be the problem of allowing access in any R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Can you just talk to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| Yeah, this is a Band-Aid approach to providing access from alleys within the infill overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3434)|
| 0:57:23| because we're currently not able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| A better approach would be to relook at the whole paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| and come back and examine the premise that was the basis for this initial requirement in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| which goes back several councils, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| So we would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| We need to do this one quickly because it's holding up a couple of community development projects, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| But it is something that's being looked at or will be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| Mr. Donaldson, another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| Hypothetically speaking, if you had a large lot that was fronted with a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| and on the back was an alleyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| would you do an administrative division and then have the house accessed from the alleyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| as its only means of ingress and egress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| As I understand it, the current language was put in place specifically to address that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| In my mind, our code didn't allow that in the first place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| because it requires street frontage or frontage on a joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| And an alley wouldn't qualify as a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| But I think that the language that appears in this paragraph was specifically addressing that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3522)|
| 0:58:49| So it would allow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Am I understanding correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| It would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| This simply allows people to use alleys as a means of egress to off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| After we talked Friday, I thought about the second district controversy a number of years ago of Dr. Gardner's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| behind his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| And I was wondering, are we potentially getting ready to open that can of worms in a similar method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3549)|
| 0:59:15| where you can build a house behind a house and have this different access coming into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| where you're giving incentive to people to take big lots and start stacking houses behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| I want to make sure I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Changing this will not allow that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| I think the current code disallows that by requiring frontage either on a street or a joint permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3576)|
| 0:59:45| in the amount of 25 feet minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| That was a drive-by, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| But I was saying if it could be similar where you were stacking like in Dr. Gardner's example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| where the access was at the rear of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| And you were saying street, not driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3606)|
| 1:00:07| And an alley is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Not alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| An alley is not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Is that correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| An alley is not considered a street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| And then a driveway would be delineated by stating driveway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| There would not be any gray area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| I certainly well recall what Councilman Frost is speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3631)|
| 1:00:37| I believe it's fairly straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| That's what we're checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| We just had a little crisis a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Mr. Donaldson, I heard you say in response to Councilman Becker that this Band-Aid approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| that you all are kind of looking at is still for the overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| trying to make a better way of overall looking at this issue and this paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Did I hear you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| We currently have situations where areas of the city are platted with alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| and they may not be improved to current city standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| and we are not we as a city are not allowing people to use those for access to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| required off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Yeah, that's where I was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| As you all are looking at this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| have we already done a survey of the available stock out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| And part of this is going to be a cost factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| and I don't know if you all are talking to engineering or other parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| but ultimately if we move this direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| there's going to be additional requirements with regards to maintenance, upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| paving, et cetera, that we need to understand may come down the line with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| We've had those conversations with city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| And I think ultimately Council needs to be updated on those conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| so we're well aware that while it all sounds well and good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| down the line we may be for this Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| or other Councils making an additional line item for the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| that we need to make sure that we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Let me just follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Does anybody from engineering or neighborhood services want to address Mr. Brown's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| Any thoughts on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| We have had some conversations with MPC about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| and as I understand the overlay, the driveway would have to be constructed off the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| As you know, in several districts, most districts, alleys are not paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| and some of them are primarily used for garbage pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| So, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| they're not in a condition that most people are going to want to use as their primary access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| So we do think as this program grows that the city will need to pay more attention to alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| And we've had some discussions with Mr. Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| and I think he's talked with the mayor, and we're trying to formulate a way to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3793)|

| 1:05:06| Yeah, I have a process, I guess it's a request rather than a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| This isn't an area that we're doing a lot of planning about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| There is a study that just came out that was a whole transportation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| We just, I don't know if we finished the small area plan for this area, and then there's a redevelopment area going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| And in the write-up on this, none of those three things got mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| I don't think they're a factor necessarily, but I'd like to ask that in the future, somewhere in the write-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| there's a mention of all these plans, even if it's just to say this should have no impact on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| I think if we're doing these plans, it's easy to forget about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| and this is obviously a real concrete way to keep them in our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| So is that a doable thing on a regular basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=3948)|

| 1:07:00| Yeah, I had gotten an email earlier, and I think they had a letter attached to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| that brought up some interesting questions or fine points and details relative to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| And I see, and I don't want to put anybody on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4031)|

| 1:07:49| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Whoever would like to speak for the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| It just seems to me after reading the letter that there was some finer points that I had not thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| but that I think deserve mentioning here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Buzz or David, if one of you all want to just speak to the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| Give us your name and address one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Buzz Goss, 121 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I'm a signature of the letter, and I believe there are 16 of us that signed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| the majority of which are the businesses or the people actually sort of doing most of the downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| And I should begin by saying we don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| We think we're heading in the right direction, but we have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| and I just want to move cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| You know, the idea that we're going to go from what we have right now, which we've been working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| and quite frankly it's not easy to get through, it's very cumbersome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| to suddenly adding extra layers of bureaucracy and a political process through a citizen review board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4126)|
| 1:08:54| quite frankly, daunting and a little bit scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| And so we're just asking to, if it has to be adopted as it's written right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| then I think you can very clearly take the part that's called public realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| and call that the urban design guidelines and the part that's called private realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| and make the, and those are the building design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| and make the urban design guidelines mandatory and the building design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4154)|
| 1:09:21| at least for now on the temporary purposes, a voluntary set of guidelines for us to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| And let us figure out how this works and make sure that we're not, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| putting a damper on the process and making it harder for us to do and more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| and driving up prices and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| We have a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| We'd be glad to answer a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| I think David probably has some points he wants to make, so I'm going to put him on the spot if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4182)|
| 1:09:50| I'm David Dewhurst, 133 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| I have been actually waiting for this day to come for a long time, probably several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| I sat on the original committee that brought Grand Ole Ramble into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| I guess it's been over three years ago now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| And, you know, if anything, I've been a little disappointed that we haven't gotten to this day sooner than now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4207)|
| 1:10:17| However, going through this process, I believe what happened was on the way to creating what Grand Ole Ramble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4217)|
| 1:10:27| suggested for our downtown as urban design guidelines that we may have taken it just a little bit too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4227)|
| 1:10:37| And the problem, and hopefully many of you saw the letter that a number of us put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| and I want to say we're very, very supportive of establishing design standards for the urban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| for the public realm for what we call urban design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| And we think those need to be mandatory, and like I said, I wish they would have happened several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4253)|
| 1:10:59| However, something happened after Grand Ole Ramble suggested these items and moved on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| and we had a downtown advisory council that I think picked up that charge and said, you know, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| we need to have urban design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| A committee was put in place, and I think at that point that's where a differentiation got a little bit lost between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4274)|
| 1:11:24| what exactly are urban design guidelines, how do they make buildings interact with the sidewalk, with the public space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| why are setbacks important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| And we've carried that now to very subjective issues of the design of buildings themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| and lots of little aesthetic and beautification features of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| And that's the part that I don't just agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I think that that's very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| I think there's a number of people that see that as sort of problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| One of the issues that's come up obviously tonight was the addition of stories to a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4311)|
| 1:11:58| And certainly there's more than one case out there in this downtown where if we don't add some additional square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4318)|
| 1:12:06| to some of these buildings, they will be economically not feasible to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| There's another building on Gay Street that's just a few doors down from the one that these gentlemen are working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| that falls in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| And we have got to deal with, I think, a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| I would point out right now I'm involved with doing the old Hamilton National Bank building downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| That building was built in 1912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| In 1928, they added two stories to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| And we all walk by that building today and go, what a fabulous historic structure, all 15 floors of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| including the top two that are additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| So just automatically saying and putting and codifying in this design guideline package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4364)|
| 1:12:51| saying that the adding of stories is bad, is I don't think that we quite want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4371)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, I think how you maybe get there perhaps needs to be addressed further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| But this document is a pretty sensitive document because it's not guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| These are mandatory regulations of what's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| And if they were just guidelines, then that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We could have a public debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| We could go through a committee and we could talk about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| The public could put a lot of social pressure on people to do things a little differently to kind of conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| But if that didn't work out, you'd have a voluntary position to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| And I don't think you ought to have that for the urban design component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| but I do think you should have that for the subjective features of how beautiful this building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| or what style you may want to build it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| I spent some time, I called George Crandall today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| And George had downloaded this document, the proposed document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| He said he downloaded it, got it off the MPC website about ten days ago and had been looking through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| And he said, you know, David, these are really, this item that we encourage Knoxville to go forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4434)|
| 1:14:03| because it's a very tricky, sensitive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| He goes, if they're done correctly, they can encourage quality development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| they can promote sustenance of property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| He goes, but if they're not done correctly, they can actually lead to discouraging development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| He goes, we've seen all sorts of cases that have come up that do just that, both good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| And it is very important to sort out what is right and what is wrong and how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| And he told me today, he said, you know, looking at this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| what he told me was, I don't think this document gets you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| It's not to say that it's all wrong or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| I think there's so many good parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| And we have come so far, we've worked so hard to take ourselves to this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| that it seems like we ought to work just a little bit harder to make sure we're getting all of it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| And even when we do that, he said in Portland, Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| he said they developed their first building urban design guidelines about 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| He goes, they have updated it twice since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| And he said, you know, it's a constant process, but it's something that if you get it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| and you continue to work on it and you continue to see how it works together, that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| But starting dead cold with a mandatory set that's put forward that has a lot of subjectivity to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| is a pretty dangerous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| And I just think it's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| And that's why when we put out this letter today, we wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| let's go ahead and make the urban design parameters of this mandatory and make those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| But let's be really careful about the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| And if it takes a little time, if it takes, you know, I don't have a perfect suggestion on how to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| The one we presented was let's make the building design portion of it voluntary for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| and let's see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Let's see how this committee gets put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| I think Buzz can tell you about a situation that he faced in a historic zoning committee meeting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| right here in Knoxville not long ago, where he went through, and hopefully I'll get him to tell the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| but, I mean, he went through a lot of hassle and a lot of time and a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| to change a couple window mullions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| And, you know, if you look at what he had designed and what they got changed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| it's kind of a coin flip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| What's really better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| And was it really worth all that process to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| The other piece that I think is important here is that, and this is another thing that George told me today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| is that differentiating these things, because it's so difficult for all of us just to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| what exactly is an urban design guideline versus a building design guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| But.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Maybe you need to wrap up in about 15 or 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| And what his issue was is that the urban features need to be throughout the entire downtown district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| whereas specific building design issues ought to be localized to specific blocks or zones in that downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4620)|
| 1:17:08| And they need to be formed about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| Retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Is this an office area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| What are those particular things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| And that's not exactly what this document does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| I just think we need to take a little time to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| I'm going to go back to Vice Mayor Brown since you hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Do you have something else or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| What I was going to do is kind of, based on what Dave has said, those things came out of the letter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| You know, initially from looking at the letter, the first thing I thought about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| are we about to embark upon something that could actually maybe prohibit the finishing of developing downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| and maybe require us as a council and as an administration and as a city of taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| to do even more with the tax dollars to incentivize folks downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| We are hopefully getting to a position where we'll begin to back away from those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| If we put a process in place that may make it more costly to do some things downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| and not to the benefit of the taxpayers but to the benefit of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| I think we're not doing justice to what we're doing downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| I am not a designer, an architect, a builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| You know, I'm just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| And I can't look through here and tell you urban design guideline, building design guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| I do see public and the private part of this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And I do think that the suggestion that's been put forward is one that we should consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| I remember this discussion and hearing things about urban design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| and when this first happened years ago when Crandall Rambler was here and all the meetings downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| And now we are talking about, you know, sizes and we could get into issues of color of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4717)|
| 1:18:43| and those kinds of things and all we want is do we really need to micromanage like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| So I have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Also, and this is not just specifically here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| but as I look at what we are beginning to do as a council and as an administration with regards to the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4734)|
| 1:19:02| and the overlays and the things that we're doing, new guidelines, I think we are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| and it's true, I think we are adding layers of bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| You know, and I think we need to be very careful in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| What we do now, we're putting another committee that's going to take a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| that's going to revise it or go through the Historic Zoning Commission or this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| or this committee that citizens are going to have to go through and then ultimately appeal to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| or then maybe the BZA and then maybe the council or maybe the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| And as we do these things that we think are making the process better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| I hope we're not creating a bigger process and a bigger government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| in trying to deal with some of these issues because that concerns me also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| just in the broad stroke of kind of what we have been doing here of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| I have some specific questions about the composition of the Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| If I added up correctly, I think it's eight members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| You know, hopefully you're going to make it nine so you've got an uneven group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| You know, we've got a group of staff and permanent members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| but we also have in the rotating membership two positions that are designated to particular bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| One is the Historic Zoning Commission and one is the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Well, I don't know that that's rotating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| The person may rotate in and out, but it sounds like those are permanent positions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| So they may be mislabeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| You know, if that calls for a member of those organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| that makes those permanent positions and maybe it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| But I get concerned about what we're doing now with regards to a lot of the different layers I see we're adding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| and trying to improve the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I hope we're not making it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I'd like to hear Council chime in and talk about the whole issue and the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| It sounds reasonable to me that the Urban Design Guidelines be made mandatory, and I think that's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| and it should be throughout downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| You know, when you go downtown now and I look at downtown, I remember when I first got on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| I mean, what a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| I've been on council now almost six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| What a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| I mean, how beautiful it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| You walk downtown and it's vibrant and it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| And you look at the buildings and we've come a mighty long way, but we've got a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| And let's not trip ourselves or stub our toe now by trying to once again come up with the newest, brightest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4871)|
| 1:21:18| shiniest new process that actually hurts us and doesn't help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| So I hope we're going to get some comment and some discussion about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| and the whole issue of urban design versus building design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| I'm kind of finding this similar to the South Knoxville waterfront process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| I've seen it here counted over some 14 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| There have been 13 public meetings, not including when it was heard at MPC five weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| It passed on consent agenda, which means one person can simply phone in or show up at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| and say, I don't want this on consent agenda, and it's automatically removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| Personally, I think the plan should be adopted as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Otherwise, you run the risk of emasculating, first, the public process, and, second, the intent of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| Unfortunately, I don't, you know, many laws are put in place for the lowest common denominator in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| I don't think Mr. Goss, Mr. Dewhurst, or any of them are those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| I want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| But that's one thing that you do guard against when you have laws, when you have process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| This council has put into place over time, including us and well before us, of different overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| We just voted on starting another overlay process earlier tonight in the Whittle Springs, Bell Morris area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4958)|
| 1:22:49| We've had a workshop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| I support the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| I guess this is an interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I think the Vice Mayor raised a lot of good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| and I think a piece that I guess Mr. Dewhurst and Mr. Goss talked about is moving cautiously on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| I think you all framed it really well, and it's a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| It is, as Mr. Farr said, similar to South Waterfront, the overlays we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| The Oakwood-Lincoln Park overlay that I had to put off tonight, Mr. McBath raised some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| and in a short discussion with him, he talked about a lot of the same things, the uncertainty, the bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| But at one point he had a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| He said, I'm going to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| Ninety-nine percent of the people are going to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| And it was a very colorful phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| He said, there are people who are going to build a house that looks like Grover's Hind End.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| And I think part of what we've got to worry about, and I think where Mr. Frost is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| is how do you deal with that one person who doesn't want to do it well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| And I see the 14 names here, and I think what would happen with these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| and I think with a lot of the developers, is what happened with the Crimson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| is to come in and to say, we want to do things a little differently, and we can work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| And it's a little bit of a hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| But my tendency would be to say, I'd rather have these be mandatory and see how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| because I have a tremendous fear about that person who wants to do the really bad job coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| and it's where I think the overlays that we're putting in are helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| They prevent the worst thing from happening, and then you can build from there with the good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| So I'm probably going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| And it's not that what you're saying isn't valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| I think it's an important thing to move cautiously on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| But I'd rather have the protection in and then take a step back if we find it's a little too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5073)|
| 1:24:39| rather than not put enough in and maybe miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Was Mr. Bailey ahead of me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| I was wondering if it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| I think maybe he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| I wasn't sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| I was just trying to kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Where's your Coke can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| I appreciate all the work that's gone into this, and I know it's been a long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| and Councilman Roddy and Mark Donaldson and Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| But one of the things that has caught my attention is when I started hearing about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| delays and a political process and bureaucracies and potential hassles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| and things being subjective and really another layer of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| then I get concerned because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| I think a lot of us were interested coming into office on having a clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| more direct path to doing business with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| And, you know, it just sort of directs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| It concerns me that, you know, we're going to yet create another, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| layer of government outside here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| You know, many times it's a self-serving group of people, not that that's always the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| and there's always politics in everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| But whether it's the South Waterfront or this one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| I think that until it's all said and done, we ought to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| We ought to see if there's a better way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| And I think we've got some real experts out here that have been doing business with the city for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| and they came with some suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| And I think we ought to, you know, we shouldn't rush into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| and we ought to discuss it and see if there's a better way of working this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| First of all, I'd like to say for the gentleman that came tonight with some suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| I think all of us on council respect your body of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| and respect the tremendous contribution that each of you have made individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| and that all of, you know, others have made as a group in terms of improving our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| However, I have to say that as a member of this steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| I wouldn't put my name on this document unless it came with my unqualified endorsement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| I've heard concerns tonight that perhaps we've moved too quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| You know, we have moved cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| This is the outcome, as was mentioned tonight, of at least a three-year process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| that began with the Crandall-Arambula study that moved into the Mayor's Downtown Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| that he appointed when he first came into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| And one of the prime recommendations of that task force was that our community look at the adoption of design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5230)|
| 1:27:16| So that led to the appointment of this steering committee to look at downtown design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| And we have been at work for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| We began in January of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| As Councilman Frost said, there have been numerous public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| We had five public workshops or open houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| We had nine steering committee meetings, all of which were announced and open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| We had a council workshop, and there were four different postings to the MPC website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| as progress continued beginning back in March of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| So that was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| The plan is not capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| It's the result of an exhaustive survey of design guidelines in other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| Portland was mentioned tonight in terms of looking at what has worked and what hasn't worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| And the issue of mandatory versus voluntary guidelines was addressed very early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| If you remember, that was one of the main topics of our workshop on these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| And the steering committee found, as MPC staff reported back to us repeatedly, that voluntary guidelines don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5294)|
| 1:28:24| You might as well not have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| And, again, the folks who are doing good development are going to comply anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| And these folks that we're hearing from tonight I truly believe are for the best that we have to offer in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| But we heard from folks in other communities that you have to have a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| And when you bring in this idea of optional, you know, I think of it as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| If I have optional rules, then what do I do with the child that comes in late?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| You know, you either do or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And we felt like it was important that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| There's concern that the guidelines aren't nimble enough or that the review committee will add a layer of bureaucracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5340)|
| 1:29:13| And, truly, that was something that we struggled with, and the review committee is designed to be nimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| There's a requirement that an answer be given to anyone who submits a plan within 30 days, which was as tight as we could squeeze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| We had to get it down even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| And with the vagaries of the calendar and filing deadlines, you know, we talked about one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| but what if you apply on the 31st of the month, then it's the new month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Anyway, 30 days was the tightest that we felt like we could get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| And I think the idea of having this review committee is what adds flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| We talked tonight about the Crimson building and that we were, in essence, serving as that review board tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| And, you know, maybe it doesn't fulfill everything on the list, but the list isn't written in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| Nothing in here is codified as an absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| And so the idea of a review committee is to add that layer of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| So in that regard, I see it as a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| It adds flexibility to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Like I said, I think we've moved cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Ms. Dewhurst spoke about guidelines being specific to different zones of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| And if you look at the guidelines, that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Downtown is divided up into a warehouse district and the traditional grid district and the boulevard district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| And all of that is designed to have responsiveness to the needs and the footprint of those different areas of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5437)|
| 1:30:47| Finally, I'd like to echo Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| I think this council and this administration have made it a huge priority to put public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| and transparency at the forefront of everything we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| And certainly from my involvement in this process, that has been a hallmark of what we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| We not only have had public meetings, we've tried to reach out to stakeholders in terms of direct mailings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5467)|
| 1:31:13| I can't attest to making any telephone calls, but I know there were follow-ups with e-mails to a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| And I think when there hasn't been responsiveness or disagreement with this up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| all the way through the approval at MPC on consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| I really think it flies in the face of what we're trying to do with public process to turn around and tinker with this at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5491)|
| 1:31:40| I think it's a terrific document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Like anything we do, it's a living document, and it can be adjusted if it's not working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| But, again, I give my unqualified endorsement of this product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| Hey, Buzz, will you talk to me for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| You know, design is inherently subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| And to some extent, what seems to be mandatory is that a person's project will have to have a conversation with somebody with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5530)|
| 1:32:21| What do you object to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| And also, I also respect your body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| I respect the project that we looked at tonight, and I like your sensibility when it comes to design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5550)|
| 1:32:38| But it seems maybe between the time you wrote this letter and tonight, are you experiencing this a little bit differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5558)|
| 1:32:47| I guess I don't quite understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Well, it sounds to me, I mean, we had a review of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| and what I heard from Councilman Roddy is that there's flexibility in terms of these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5574)|
| 1:33:05| about how to build downtown and build a beautiful downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| The document in the front page says that the goals of the guideline are to define expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| and to allow flexibility while fostering high-quality design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| You probably wouldn't want to argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Oh, certainly not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I guess, Councilman Whitehall, that I guess I come from the perspective of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| And I'm thinking as I'm speaking here, really trying to get to the core of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| So forgive me, I hope, if I stumble a bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| But in my experience, we haven't had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5618)|
| 1:33:43| And while it might come, there might be a 1%, there's nothing to warrant that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5623)|
| 1:33:51| But the person that David said he spoke to, Crane, the Lorambula brand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| suggested that in order for us to move forward, we need design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| So I'm not saying we necessarily had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Well, he didn't say we had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| But those were guidelines that that process felt was necessary for us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| And I was going to try to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| Like I said, I'm stumbling with my words here as I'm thinking on my feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| One of the things that happened in this process, I have been consistent, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| over the years of saying let's be very careful about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| You know, what are we trying to do with the guidelines and what are the benefits from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| and what are we trying to solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| And I was not even convinced that we should have urban design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| until I believe the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| And just for clarification, I've been to at least half the meetings, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| And I was stating at the September meeting where we were with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| and Mr. Donaldson, I asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| I said, well, what's the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| What are we trying to solve here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| What are we trying to fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| And he spoke of issues like, well, Summit Hill Drive was forced through the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| the middle of the grid district and he talked about Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| and he spoke about the city county building and things that weren't very good urban projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| and they were public projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| And I said, well, what's happened on the private side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| And he couldn't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Now, I could give you a couple that might be controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| I think we all know about them, but there's not a consensus one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| in the community, you know, whether the building was right or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| But at that point, I became convinced that, yes, we need to have urban design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| and need to adopt them because I don't think Henley Street is a good urban street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| and I don't think Summit Hill Drive is a good urban street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| And so that's where I became convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| And, you know, David and I had a long-running discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| and that's the point where I said, okay, David, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| We do need urban design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| And I felt like we engaged in the process trying to, you know, be positive about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| and say, okay, let's proceed on this, but, you know, let's not know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| let's not go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| Let's do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| And it wasn't until this came out in January that we knew the extent to which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| the document was proposing to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| That is, that it was going beyond just the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| It was going to statements like rehabilitate historic structures in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| with the Secretary of Interior Standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Well, that's a whole other level of criteria that I've been through on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| I can tell you it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| The Sturkey Building, as an example, the windows there are not the original windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| And the mullion patterns are close to the original, but they're not precisely the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5785)|
| 1:36:31| And I went month after month after month sending documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| and conversing with Guy Lapsley up in Washington who was reviewing our design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| of trying to get those windows right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| We wanted to get them to be right, but there was no way we could salvage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| the original and there was no way we could build new windows that looked like the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| because technology has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| And so I think everybody would walk up and say, wow, those windows look great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| They look natural on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| But they're not the original and they're not exactly like the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| In fact, they're quite different, but they do respect the character of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| and they do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| I'm concerned that we're entering layers like that and beginning to get into conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| that go well beyond what I think the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| Someone made the comment on council here that was suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| why didn't you say all this stuff in the public process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| But what I heard you say is that you didn't really have anything to react to until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| We tried to give positive influence or positive comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| And I know I heard from everybody here, Mr. Sanders, David Dewhurst, Jeffrey Nash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| in those meetings that, hey, let's streamline this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| We've got some issues here on urban design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| We've got some problems with some streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| But I didn't hear anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Nobody said, okay, let's go ahead and start talking about windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| and start talking about cornices and start talking about styles and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| But generally speaking, it sounds like both of you really like this direction that we're heading in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| I think we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Just a couple comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| I like my first comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| I'll go to the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| On page 29, historic resources, I don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| and I'm not sure who I would direct this question to, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| Under new construction within or adjacent to a historic district or building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| infill construction should be designed to reflect architectural and historic qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5902)|
| 1:38:31| I guess Ann Wallace from MPC could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| Would you be willing to answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| So what is that saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Could you come up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| Is that saying that an infill has to be historic in design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Because that's kind of what it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Maybe reflect needs to be complement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| I think that's an appropriate adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| The idea is that we have complementary structures so that the buildings respond to historic characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| One example that we've used on several occasions is the example here on Main Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| where the Nation's Bank building has actually stepped their front facade back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| in order to preserve the sight lines into the historic First Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| Additionally, they used complementary materials in terms of the stonework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| and also having a yard space out in front of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| The idea is to have it complement so that the historic district maintains its feel and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| Could I ask Ann a question while she's up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Sure. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Ms. Wallace, there's been a question about the publication of the guidelines in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| and since you follow this most closely in terms of postings and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| could you address how this information has been made public through the process, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| On page 54 and 53, you have an outline of the public meeting schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| and also the public postings to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| On page 54, the meeting that we had with City Council is listed as meeting number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=5998)|
| 1:40:06| I'm sorry, meeting number 11, July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| On July 14th, the following day, we posted the first draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| which included the public realm, the private realm, and the historic resources draft on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| Granted, they have been modified on several occasions to reflect the public meetings that we had after that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6019)|
| 1:40:25| but they were posted on our website at that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| And so the concept of the mandatory guidelines and the public and the private realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| and all of that were coming together in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| The concept of mandatory guidelines was the issue that was brought to bear in the September meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| and that actually came out of the council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| There was a concern whether or not the public had really spoken to that specific issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| but the ideas of the public realm, the private realm, or as Mr. Goss has referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| the building design as opposed to the urban design were drafted in one form by July 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6054)|
| 1:41:03| Thank you for letting me go out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6064)|
| 1:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| Well, in pondering mandatory versus voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| in thinking about whether or not our first set of guidelines is going to be perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| and it's not going to need adjustment, I think the answer to that question is that it's not going to be perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| and it's going to have to be adjusted and changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| As other cities have done, and as Mr. Dewhurst pointed out from his conversation with George Crandall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| that they've done in Portland, if you don't make a mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| then I don't know how that revision and refinement process happens effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6103)|
| 1:41:51| because there's really nothing to push back against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| No one's looking at your project and saying, well, this fits or it doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| I mean, people will do that on an ad hoc basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| but you won't really ever have to, it won't be checked or juried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| or whatever the term you want to use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| And so I don't see how that's going to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6136)|
| 1:42:22| I think if you make it mandatory and then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6142)|
| 1:42:28| we will do our best to review and revise these guidelines as we see the need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6148)|
| 1:42:37| I think that's probably the better way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| I'm not opposed to further input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| My tendency is to vote for this as it stands on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| and then see what we need to do in terms of further input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| Back to what Mr. Dewhurst said in his conversation with George Crandall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| I have a lot of respect for George Crandall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| My first contact with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| other than seeing him on a video that the American Institute of Architects put out a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6183)|
| 1:43:09| I think in 1998, my first personal contact with him was when he came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| And I think he did a lot of good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| He and Donna Rambula in terms of their downtown draft plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| but they weren't able to take it as far as they might have liked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| under the difficult circumstances that they had to work in then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| But I think they did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| And, again, I have a lot of respect for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| I was in Portland in October and called and checked to see if he was going to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| but we worked out a time and I stopped by and visited with George at their offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| talked to them for a while and talked about what was happening in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| And he does try to keep up with what's going on in Knoxville, especially downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| He was familiar with a lot of things that are happening here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| especially what he could read about on the web and online and in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| And I think he may talk to certain folks from time to time, but he has a pretty good feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| And we had a good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| And then he said on the way out, he said, let me go down to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| Their office is actually a rooftop penthouse on a ten-story building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| And it's a little different architecturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| similar to some of the things we're talking about tonight, but somewhat different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| Anyway, he said, I want to show you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| I'll go down to the street with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| So he took the elevator down and stood on the street corner and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| look at the four corners and tell me where the parking garage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| And I looked and I guessed correctly, but it was very difficult to spot that parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| And he started pointing out the features and how the fenestration, the openings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| the window-style openings matched the other detailing, the corbeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| and the horizontal detailing and the masonry finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| All that matched an adjacent historic building to a large degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| He pointed out how on the street level next to the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| they didn't allow what's called ephus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| It's a synthetic stucco material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| They required real stone veneer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| George Crandall was the one that put together, more than anybody else, Portland's design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| And these are mandatory guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| And they are quite specific in terms of building detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| So when George Crandall says, if he says this document's not quite there yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| he probably believes this document's not quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| But this is not a man who, in my experience, advocates voluntary guidelines because he knows they don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6340)|
| 1:45:50| And he just advocates making sure that you've done the best job that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| And as Mr. Dewhurst pointed out, they've revised their guidelines over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| And I think that's what you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| I think you have to start with something that's mandatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| and be very careful that you haven't created problems rather than solving problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| and begin to revise them as you see the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| And, again, I'm not saying that we shouldn't visit this further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| I think we should approve it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| But I really think that we're headed in the right direction as a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| And we need good feedback from people like George Crandall and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Before I make any comments myself, Dr. Lyons, you had your light on for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| You're in my line of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Is there something you really wanted to say to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Well, I would like to speak very much in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| And I think Ms. Roddy put an awful lot of what I had to say very well before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| But one, this is an exercise in avoiding imaginary horribles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| And imaginary horribles that David and Buzz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| and the folks who are here are talking about is a process that becomes unwieldy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and difficult and adds expense and adds time and gets in the way of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| We're very aware of that imaginary horrible on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| And as Ms. Roddy said, we've done an awful lot, made a lot of effort to streamline this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| and to try to set this up to where that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| It could happen, but there are then appeals to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| and other places to protect against a board which becomes overly controlling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| because that's not its intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| I think the imaginary horrible that this is meant to protect against, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| is something that we came close to having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| and that is the Hampton Inn that is now over there on the corner down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| That one, actually, we were only able to kind of apply informal guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| through the use of the abatement that they came to us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| because having that hotel built up on a garage at one of our key corners fit zoning fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| Everything else was about to happen and, in fact, was designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| Ever since then, I personally have been convinced of the importance of some mandatory guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| not that anybody here would propose that, but people can purchase lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| they can purchase buildings, many things can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| And I think as much public investment as we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| both indirectly through the abatement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| and directly through the direct expenditure of money such as on Market Square for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| you know, one very bad decision that makes a dead rather than alive streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| like the Hilton Garage that everybody points to as something that is a bad use of a street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| is a 50-year, at least, difficulty to try to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| And I think, you know, right now that can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| I don't see it happening immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I don't see it happening by the people who signed this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| But I think that that, to me, is something that can't be easily corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| becomes literally in concrete at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| And we're in a position in our office to see some folks have come with suggestions and ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| and preliminary things that do great violation to the kind of quality downtown that is not that large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6540)|
| 1:49:07| and that we've all invested a lot in and, frankly, that the folks here have invested a lot in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| So I just wanted to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| This is not an abstract argument about the potential for some real damaging design that may work for an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6554)|
| 1:49:20| but really for the entire downtown and have some real negative consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| I was very interested to know what you had on your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| I appreciate you sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| Let me just say, you know, I can see the imaginary horribles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| I well understand, and I think when we discussed the Crimson Building and the issues there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| and the things that were needed to make that work, you know, that would have been a terrible horrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| if we had not been able to be flexible and reasonable and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| and exercise some good business judgment and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6594)|
| 1:49:59| On the other hand, I think Dr. Lyons as well helped us visualize the imaginary horribles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| that you would not want to see next door to you and the development that you'd put your heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| and your soul and your pocketbook into, and neither would the bank be happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| So, you know, somewhere, as council members, we have to make decisions that visualize the horribles on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6615)|
| 1:50:25| And, frankly, when I first came into the office, one of the first things I heard was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| oh, gosh, we don't want to develop downtown because downtown is so difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| and you have so many rules and you have this and you have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| and stormwater is one of the things that first comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| And, you know, everybody was just shaking their head about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| And now, you know, here's the county saying, oh, gosh, we wish we would develop those same policies that the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| Even though it's more difficult, it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| So in looking at this, that's one of the issues I have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| The other is, I believe Councilman Frost might have mentioned it, but we've just approved the south waterfront plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6657)|
| 1:51:07| And in doing that, I had to be so respectful of the people who had participated in that long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| both the people on the staff, but all the staffs that were involved in that, all the neighborhood people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| everyone who had really come to so many compromises, but looked at the overall picture for what's best for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6681)|
| 1:51:32| So there is one reservation I have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| And my little experience of being a strange person and going to NPC meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| and wasting four hours there on a Thursday afternoon every couple weeks makes me worry about boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| It really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| It makes me worry about appointed commissions and boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| So I do look at this and say, the appointees, Mr. Donaldson, I don't worry about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| I see Ms. Royera looking at you with very sympathetic eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| But it does concern me because sometimes I've experienced boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6726)|
| 1:52:12| and appointed groups that do tend to make it extremely easy or difficult for something to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6732)|
| 1:52:21| That does concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| The accountability is not really the same as it is for elected officials, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| And I hope we always act in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| So with those reservations and those comments and observations, I'll just say it's my inclination to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6750)|
| 1:52:39| because it's been a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Everyone's been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| It's been a lengthy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| I think it's been a quite adequate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| And I think not to support it because it has been such a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| It really diminishes the importance of these processes that we put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| So my inclination is to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| The fact that I know those of you who are facing us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| I know, like I said before, we'll be watching you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| Well, I know you'll be watching us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And I know you'll be staying in close touch with the mayor, with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| So, you know, I just think together, this administration, this council, this community can make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6799)|
| 1:53:28| And I think that does mean that we've got to be flexible and we've got to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| We have got to really look at this in a very realistic sense of what will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| And very frankly, I love the skyline of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| It's extremely eclectic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| It's the most exciting thing to just turn onto Main and look east and see the eclectic skyline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6824)|
| 1:53:55| It is so exciting to me because I think it ties us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| It ties the past with the present with the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| And to me, that just speaks volumes of who we are in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| So, you know, given that and thinking about a sermon I heard last night, we don't live optimistic lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6847)|
| 1:54:15| We live lives with hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| That was the main point of our minister's talk last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| And so I'm going to be very hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| Not necessarily optimistic because sometimes that gets you kind of wiped out and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| But I'm going to be very hopeful that everyone is going to continue to be engaged and continue to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| And this is going to be an absolutely exploding, exciting time for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6874)|
| 1:54:39| So I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| But hang in there with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| Keep us paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| You know, and I found myself in the same position with the South Knox Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| in that I disagree with some of my fellow council members in their interpretation, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| of the importance and the applicability of the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| You know, I heard the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| And I think one council member chimed in and kind of chastised me for my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| So I vote alone sometimes and I get chastised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| It doesn't bother me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| But, you know, I think that I was elected four, five, six years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6915)|
| 1:55:23| and attended who knows how many meetings more than were done over this last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| over this process to have these kinds of discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| You know, I think that the public process and transparency is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| It's very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| When I look back on my history, look back on the history of the folks that I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| one of the reasons public process and transparency is important because it tended to leave out when you didn't have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| low income folk, poor folk, the kind of folk I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| So I do not disrespect the public process and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| I embrace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| However, I do not think that it means that once a process like that has occurred that you do not debate those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| and you do not maybe come back and make some adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| I think that what it does, the public process and transparency, adds credibility to the ultimate decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| Now, if we debate an issue tonight and make a change tonight, I don't think it is emasculating the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| Because if it is, then if we later on down the process change it, we are then emasculating the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| So I don't think that that argument right now really doesn't catch with me because we just did it with the infield guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6984)|
| 1:56:32| When we talked about the infield guidelines the first time, people talked about alleys way back when we first passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| Let's get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Now we're struggling with alleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| And back then some people bought that issue up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| And we know we've got to push it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| Let's respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| And I want to respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| And ultimately, because this is first reading while I vote with this, I do want counsel and people to understand I'm not against public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7007)|
| 1:56:55| or respecting the hard work of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| I think that is a part of the decision-making process and interest that comes into hopefully building a better mousetrap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7017)|
| 1:57:05| And I do not think that my job is to say there was a set number of meetings, a set number of discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| and, therefore, I don't want to upset anybody and I'm going to sit here and go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| You know, I think my job is to look and say, hey, you know, if down the line we think we're going to have to make some adjustments here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7036)|
| 1:57:23| why not have the discussion now as opposed to having it later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| And I think that's very important to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| That's why we have checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| That's why we have committees that do reports and we have NPC that does work, and it comes with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| You know, we have all these processes out here that come to make these decisions, these laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7056)|
| 1:57:42| these processes that we come together, they're there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| We have these layers of checks and balances so that we can continue to have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| We have these layers of tiers of decision making so that, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| we can get to a position to hopefully have talked about it all, taken everything into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7072)|
| 1:57:57| So that's why I wanted to have this discussion, not out of any disrespect to the public process or transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| but out of the fact that I think to add credibility to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| we must continue to have this debate and take into consideration some valid points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| I don't think anybody disputes that there are valid points being made here with regards to the building design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| You know, and I think that what I hear is you guys embrace the urban design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| and I embrace what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| I want to see this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| I think what we're trying to talk about is, is there some continued discussions we need to have, as Councilman Bailey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| and I hope we continue to talk about it and talk about it sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7111)|
| 1:58:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Councilman Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Briefly, I kind of liken this mandatory versus voluntary as a diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| I do a whole lot better on the diet my wife puts me on than the one I put myself on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| And let me link up here the earlier crimson building discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| I asked the question for a purpose earlier if the crimson building would have been approved under the downtown guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7135)|
| 1:59:01| and I think you all will recall it was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| You have a building that has three levels of living space on it having two more stories put on top of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| two-thirds difference approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| You know, Buzz Goss and David Dewhurst certainly had a hand in helping Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| Market Square was developed under historic overlay guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| I would say that under no guidelines that we have are, you know, paint colors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| or any rigmarole like that is mandated or folks are told how to do and what to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7170)|
| 1:59:39| I would respectfully submit that your historic overlay is your full calorie type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| Your conservation overlay is preservation light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| And this downtown guideline is watered down preservation light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| If we can put two stories on top of a three-story building, I think we're able to have a process that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7194)|
| 2:00:03| I'm glad of being brought up earlier by the lady from MPC about the situation with Nations Bank when that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7203)|
| 2:00:13| I mean, Nations Bank or its predecessor who built it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| we could have had a much less attractive, pretty part on Main Street if the designers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7216)|
| 2:00:26| and the architects did not plan to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| We got lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Just because we got lucky once doesn't mean we'll get lucky again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| Seeing no further like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| Mayor, I just wanted to address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| One is the process, sort of like Vice Mayor Brown was talking about, whether it's the South Waterfront or this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7241)|
| 2:00:49| When I look at the schedule, you know, I look at where am I going to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| When do I sort of look at what the process has rendered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7256)|
| 2:01:01| And, you know, my question is, you know, when does the process end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| To me, the process continues until the second reading vote when the mayor calls for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7265)|
| 2:01:13| And, you know, I have the utmost respect for the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| But I have people constantly say, you know, respect the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| Honor the people's wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| Honor the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| Don't violate the public's trust in all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| And this always happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| Every process that takes place, it's human nature for people to come at the last minute with some ideas, with some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7291)|
| 2:01:40| And this council member wants to entertain those, wants to look at those, wants to examine is there a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7300)|
| 2:01:47| And so, you know, I don't think there's anything wrong with a little common sense restraint, a little patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| and to look at what people have to say about the final report or, you know, guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| I support the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| I'm just a little bit concerned about the bureaucracy or potentially, you know, another layer of government, unreasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7324)|
| 2:02:16| that eventually could lead to self-serving people because that generally happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| And so that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| And I don't know what the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| I did want to ask Buzz and David down there, having heard what we've said so far, if you had any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7344)|
| 2:02:34| anything you'd like to say to us, any recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| Well, David wrote down a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| I'm going to let him start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| Well, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| I mean, I've certainly heard what all you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| And I want to say that, you know, much of what's in this document we do want is mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| We're not trying to say make the whole thing voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| Much, much of what's in here we do want that to be mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| You know, two is, maybe this is more of a, I don't want to be here at the 11th hour arguing or debating this, I guess, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7377)|
| 2:03:05| But one maybe suggested I would make for future public processes is that maybe one of the public meetings ought to be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| after publication of the document because it wasn't until this came out in its final form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| and it appeared on a website that I didn't hear about until mid-February and Buzz brought it to my attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| that we got to really reading through it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| And I attended a bunch of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| I made a lot of comments at various of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| But it would have been nice to have one of the four public meetings after publication of the final thing for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7411)|
| 2:03:38| because there's a lot in here I really love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| But there's just a little bit that, to me, the committee flew it in at the 11th hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| And that's the problem I have with the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| It seems quite robust if you look at all the meetings and everything that was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| but that's the problem I have with it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| You know, there's a, you know, I don't want to, we've debated this probably long enough time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7437)|
| 2:04:02| but there's some other odd things about this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| We've codified in here a boulevard district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| Well, you know, the boulevards in downtown, this is bad urban design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| and yet we're about to make this the official document of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| And I, just because it was bad when they built it back then, it's pretty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| but it doesn't work very well in an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| But by God, we're celebrating it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| I don't think that's a pretty smart thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| But I don't mean to bring that up as, let's debate that topic now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| But, you know, we're talking about maybe it seems like more people here would like to go ahead and do this and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7470)|
| 2:04:38| And, you know, this isn't, we'll live with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| And hopefully we can make it better over time and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| And if that's what needs to happen, but it, but I really wish we'd do a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7483)|
| 2:04:51| And one of them would be, let's maybe take the time, and maybe it costs a little money, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| but let's go back and talk to Crandall Rambule and say, well, what's wrong with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| I mean, you guys are experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| You've done this thousands of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7502)|
| 2:05:03| We've done it once here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| And let's pass it by them, because I don't think they ever got a chance to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| And we spent a lot of money and hired them and went through a whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| And they carried the ball 80 yards for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| And just a little more maybe would get it right where we don't have to, you know, people like Buzz and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| others have to go through this commission and have to argue window mullions with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| And it's not really, it's not like it's that costly in terms of actual dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| It's just costly in terms of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| And that's the frustrating part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| There's a lot of this that I think probably ought to be adopted under historic overlay provisions rather than in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7534)|
| 2:05:39| That if we say the 400 block of Gay Street is a historic district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| then it ought to have a historic overlay, and we ought to discuss it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| But why it's in here over all of downtown, I think that's part of another little flaw with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| But, and again, I apologize for being here at this 11th hour to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| but I do feel that part of that is that, I mean, one of those meetings should have been a post-January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7555)|
| 2:06:03| But, anyway, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| Just because I was, my name is on this document and I was part of this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| I have to answer Mr. Dewhurst's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| And after the guidelines were posted on the MPC website, there was an open house in the month of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| and over 600 postcards were mailed to stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| to join the process at that point when the guidelines were in their final, final, final state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7586)|
| 2:06:32| And so I would love to have anyone who'd like to engage in future public processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7592)|
| 2:06:37| I respect your suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| And we even debated at steering committee meetings, are we reaching everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| How can we reach people better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| And, you know, aside from forming a phone tree among the seven of us, you know, we tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7605)|
| 2:06:52| We truly tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| And I apologize if we failed you in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| But, you know, again, if you look at the table, there was a meeting in January after the guidelines were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7616)|
| 2:07:02| and so I apologize if that didn't do the trick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| But it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| We tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| Mayor, I'm going to support this tonight on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| and then I'm going to try to get with some of the people that have some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7634)|
| 2:07:18| and see if there's any solutions to some of the things that I'm concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| and hopefully in two weeks I'll have a recommendation or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7646)|
| 2:07:27| But I do appreciate all the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| We're going to go ahead and vote on this, seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| I'm going to go ahead and do a voice vote, but we'll come back if there's enough disagreement to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7668)|

| 2:08:05| I'm going to move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Are there folks lined up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| There are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| There's two folks lined up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| And is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| The applicant is here, so we'll go ahead and hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7702)|
| 2:08:25| I think we'll hear from the applicant right now if that's your role to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| I think actually the motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| We'll hear first from those who are opposed, Kelvin Francis and then Rob Dentro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7720)|
| 2:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| My name is Kelvin Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| I live at 205 Maple Loop Road in South Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7733)|
| 2:08:58| I'm here to speak in opposition to the rezoning or in agreement with Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7738)|
| 2:09:09| I live two blocks off of Chapman Highway near this property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| and I've lived at Maple Loop all my life and plan on staying there the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7753)|
| 2:09:18| On September 14, 2006, MPC adopted the Chapman Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7758)|
| 2:09:26| On page 30 of this study, it states that the green space between Stone Road and Colonial Drive should be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7766)|
| 2:09:35| Why is it that we commission a study and adopt that study but then don't try to follow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7775)|
| 2:09:43| Having a section of Chapman Highway remain residential is an asset to the complete corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| There are plenty of vacant commercial properties along Chapman Highway that could be developed today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| without going into the neighborhoods of Lake Forest and Colonial Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| I believe that if this property were developed, rezoned and developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| then it would just become another vacant site in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| What happens is they build a building, they rent it out, then the properties become vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7811)|
| 2:10:21| And you see that all up and down Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| On my way here tonight, I counted about 15 empty either properties or office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7823)|
| 2:10:31| or buildings that could be rented out right now, and I'm sure somebody would love to rent those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7831)|
| 2:10:39| So these buildings would soon become empty in our experience out in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7839)|
| 2:10:49| Please follow this corridor study and oppose the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| Thank you. Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| Rob Dance Road, 1302 White Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7861)|
| 2:11:06| I own a house in Lake Forest, 107 Lake Forest Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| I am the immediate past president within a couple of years of the Lake Forest Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| I believe in the packet that City Council received looking at the fancy new online agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| it appears that you got a letter from our Neighborhood Association president in opposition to this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7883)|
| 2:11:31| A little history of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| This property was bought in a foreclosure sale by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| We appreciate that, but they actually didn't even close on the property until November 13th of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| So this is just a recent acquisition for this development group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| Originally, they wanted C3 zoning for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| I'm sure you've read all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| But they've agreed that they would compromise at 01 on the back half of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| and they're hoping to get something called planned commercial on the front half of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| Lastly, with regard to history on the property, the developers did come to the Neighborhood Association meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7927)|
| 2:12:16| They met with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| They talked to us about what they were wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| and they indicated to us that their main interest was to do some site prep, some removal of rock grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| and then move on from there and allow another developer to actually come in and help the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7946)|
| 2:12:32| If you look in your packet, you have a breakdown of the slope of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| If you actually look at the topographic map of the property, there's really not a lot that's developable there for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7958)|
| 2:12:48| There's essentially kind of a hole in the middle of the property, and maybe 40% of it looks like it's actually developable at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7968)|
| 2:12:55| So this will be an extensive grading and changing of the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| A lot of that topography, the higher elevations, is covered with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| This is essentially the entrance to the forest that is Lake Forest and creates our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7985)|
| 2:13:13| Chapman Highway Corridor Study, as Kelvin alluded to, a very important document adopted by this city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=7993)|
| 2:13:21| I forward it to each of you that sit on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| I'd just like to read a little section of it regarding Stone Road, this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8005)|
| 2:13:30| This signalized intersection needs additional turn lanes, and there is no signal head visible to traffic leaving the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| Residents exiting the apartments cannot tell whether oncoming traffic has a red light or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8016)|
| 2:13:41| Site distance improvements may be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| The green space between Stone Road and Colonial Drive should be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| There's another section of that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| A continuous center turn lane may not be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| If intersections can be designed properly, residents want safer access to the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8034)|
| 2:14:02| but they also want to protect the residential context and green space found along Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| which helps define the neighborhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8047)|
| 2:14:11| Moving on from that, what rezoning this property would mean for the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8051)|
| 2:14:18| Basically, decreased safety on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8058)|
| 2:14:23| Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| About 30 more seconds, Rob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8064)|
| 2:14:25| 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Basically, you're in a situation in which Mr. Blair has stated that Chapman Highway is under study from the city as well as TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8067)|
| 2:14:38| and if we can intensify the use of this site, then we might be able to actually get the intersection redesigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| I don't think that intensifying the use of this particular property is the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| without actually changing the road network in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| Also, the last thing I want you to look at is in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| you have a zoning map that shows the zoning all around this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| It's all on the east side of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8101)|
| 2:15:04| It's all low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| All of it, except for a couple of other spot zonings that have made their way in, similar to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| If you look, it's all LDR or OS1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| You've got MDR next to this, which is the existing apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| which is actually creating a lot of the danger on Chapman Highway as we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8120)|
| 2:15:25| If they get O1 zoning, they can come back for a use-owner view from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| and actually put in additional apartments if they wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| which would further endanger people who already use that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| So I would move that this group please deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8135)|
| 2:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8140)|
| 2:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| If you could give us your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| It's John Blair, 110 Westfield Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| Mr. Mayor, can we approach the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| Sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8153)|
| 2:16:09| And you're going to find most of those documents that was just quoted in that packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| I wish I could tell you that this property is a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath, 1,800 square foot fireplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8173)|
| 2:16:21| with a fenced-in backyard, but it's not that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8181)|
| 2:16:24| You're going to look at a quarry that they actually dug back into the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8184)|
| 2:16:29| It's a 50- to 60-foot drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| You've got about an acre of property on a lower level of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| The rest of the property, which is about 2.65 acres, is up on the upper level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| He's right in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| You're going to find the first part of the concept drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| which that really is my vision of what could possibly go on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| You'll look at the pictures the way it is right now, and he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| It's vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| It's dirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| It's a two-bedroom, one-bath house that nobody feasibly can buy because the land is more valuable than the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8216)|
| 2:17:04| So a lender is not going to lend money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| Number two is you've got a footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| Now, that becomes important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| The very last part of it is just some correspondence we've had with traffic engineering just to show that we have taken the necessary steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8230)|
| 2:17:20| to try to figure out a way we could do the ingress with those apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| The study as far as the – you'll see the typographical map there, but really in the same – in the Corda study that was quoted to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8246)|
| 2:17:41| you also approved that that be a turning lane right there, and it was brought up in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| What he didn't read is that the residents want safer access to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8267)|
| 2:17:57| but they also want to protect the residents' concept in the green space, which we do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| It's residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| If I wanted to cut the trees on it right now, I could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| But that is not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| Our intent is to do something very similar with the concept drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8286)|
| 2:18:10| But also it talks about the fact that oncoming traffic with a resident's exit apartment is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8290)|
| 2:18:19| And we just feel like by allowing us to zone this property, it gives us the ability to stay on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| This property is not something we plan on turning real quick because the value will not be recognized until there is a turn lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| So the property is going to be – you know, we'll use it to best use until a turn lane is put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| and that's when we plan on developing the property and trying to find an investor that would do the visions that we want to do on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| You know, I really – you know, if you allow this, you know, Dad always told me to do things that were smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8325)|
| 2:18:52| He said if you do things that are smart, it usually works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| When we bought this, we thought it was a smart process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| Look at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Look at the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| And you say there's got to be a better use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| And everybody can win in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| We want to increase the property value, give you something as far as revenue coming in, whether it be apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| whether it be office or mixed use as far as office space and retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| I mean, those things going up all around Knoxville that there would be a use for with a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| And I agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| The only other thing I can say is if you just allow it to two people that came here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8367)|
| 2:19:31| I'd like you to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| And I'll go back and we'll do a petition, and I'll come back and show you that we talked to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8372)|
| 2:19:39| and there's quite a few people in Knoxville that thought this was already a commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| They have no problem with it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| So for the best use of Knoxville, for the best use of revenue, generation of revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| this is a proposal that I have that's a rock quarry that is not a low-density residential use of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| that can be used to give me a chance to try to do something that's going to be nice that you'll appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| and that you'll gain more revenue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| Questions from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| Mr. Denshaw, you can have one too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Mr. Blair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Mr. Blair, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Mr. Becker has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| On your map here, can you relate where this building is going to be with what's currently the cliff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8419)|
| 2:20:27| Are you going to be taking that cliff out, or is this going to be built in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| It's too expensive to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| So if you look at the topographical map, which is probably about four or five pages back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8434)|
| 2:20:40| you'll see where Chapman Highway is, and you'll see the cliff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| This would be put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| They take a little bit out, I'm sure, but this would be pretty much the way it was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| We had them take this topographical map with our survey and come up with that footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| So this would fit on what's currently the bottom of that, and then the cliff would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| The cliff is actually to the back corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8463)|
| 2:21:04| Mr. Blair, it would face the building, the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| It would be facing Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| It would be facing Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| And we would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8473)|
| 2:21:20| You know, and I do appreciate MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| We did not know about PC1 for split zoning, and they said they're glad they didn't tell us about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8483)|
| 2:21:29| because they didn't want to go there because it is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| But what they said is that MPC brought up some very valid points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| as far as this property and use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8499)|
| 2:21:50| They just said it's unlikely for someone to put a single family home on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8510)|
| 2:21:54| We felt like the office would give the applicant reasonable use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| and keep it consistent with the zoning patterns that you have of medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| O1 is considered similar as far as intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8521)|
| 2:22:07| O1 in most cases can be less intensive than R2, especially because most offices close in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| It's a bridge that a big chunk of rock quarry is out of, and there's no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8533)|
| 2:22:22| It's a problem for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| The way traffic signals is now there's no lights facing the apartment development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| That's the other thing we hadn't addressed either is the apartments would love this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| because that would solve their problem getting in and out onto Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8551)|
| 2:22:37| But, again, I've done as much as I can without zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| If you give me zoning, then I'm going to get in touch with my attorney that will get in touch with the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8561)|
| 2:22:46| and we'll get something rolling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| It's not going to be a fast process, though, because we still won't do anything until we have a turn lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| And based on what we talked to engineering, a turn lane on this property only really needs to be about 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8574)|
| 2:23:03| There's not that much traffic turning the stone road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| You've got a traffic accident report there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| You'll see that most of the accidents there are rear ends and they're multiple car collisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8587)|
| 2:23:13| And if you had it where two or three cars could get out of the way of traffic to turn in the stone road coming north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8593)|
| 2:23:19| then that would solve a problem and not have a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| It's the same thing, traffic going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| If they had a turn lane of 150 feet, then you're not going to have traffic darting around a car in front of them that's stopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| which is where most of the traffic accidents come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| Mr. Blair, you know, I heard you say you weren't planning on really doing anything anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8616)|
| 2:23:42| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| And then I've heard about a lot of things that can and might happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| and it just sort of seems to me like you ought to let those things happen and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| But I just wanted to ask you, and it would have been helpful to have had this a little earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| because I was out there looking for the property and I called the councilman and I found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| But what is this picture of right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8642)|
| 2:24:05| That is a, these centers that they're putting in are about five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| They're usually about five stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| They're usually multi-uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| They have pizza places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| They have dry cleaners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| Again, it's just small shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| Just a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| Just a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| That's just a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| Councilwoman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| Mr. Blair, I talked to a number of people today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| I can't remember if I talked to you today or yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| Maybe it was yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| But at any rate, I thought you told me it would be offices, not commercial or retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| Your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| Our proposal was for C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8684)|
| 2:24:45| And MPC has recommended O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| I mean, we will gladly take O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| We would like to have it to where we could do retail and office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| Well, my recollection was the comment that that would be O1 or it would be office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8696)|
| 2:25:02| and you would be happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8703)|
| 2:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| But I was confused, you understand, when you commented on pizza shops, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| That is C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| Mr. Dan Strong, you have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| A 150-foot-long turning lane coming northbound on Chapman Highway would require the removal of a substantial millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8723)|
| 2:25:35| One of the geologists in the Lake Forest neighborhood told us worth a rock in order to actually take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| because of the size of the structures that are actually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| And he does this professionally for the USGS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| He knows what he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| Returning tax dollars from the site, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| I think that our city needs more money so that, you know, we can fund more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| I'm completely in favor of, you know, better use, but this isn't necessarily a better use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8759)|
| 2:26:05| And if you go back to that zoning map that I pointed out before, you look, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| there were three, two or three spot zonings on that side of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| This would make the third one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| and would further create a more difficult environment for the people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8777)|
| 2:26:22| So please deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| I think that's all the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| I've met Mr. Blair, and he's very gracious, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| He's aggressively trying to get this done, but he's good to meet with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| And Joe Harrison, the president of the Colonial Village Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| and Dave Gartner, the president of the Lake Forest Neighborhood Association, on site there at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8803)|
| 2:26:50| And, of course, he and his partner have also been to both of their subsequent neighborhood association meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8810)|
| 2:26:56| to present what it is they had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8816)|
| 2:26:59| There were a lot of concerns and reservations expressed at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| some of which you've heard represented tonight by Mr. Dansrow and Mr. Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8824)|
| 2:27:11| I don't take lightly the property owner's need to do something with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8831)|
| 2:27:18| I would point out to council that, according to Mr. Blair himself, they bought this property on a foreclosure sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8838)|
| 2:27:25| And if you they bought it in November, according to the property records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8845)|
| 2:27:31| they bought it in November of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| The deed date is November 10, 2006, and they paid $62,000 for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8854)|
| 2:27:42| So they paid some money, not a tremendous amount of money, but $62,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| It's not chicken feed, but it's not normally what you'd pay for commercial property that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| And they paid some money and gambled on getting a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| That intersection is a very difficult and dangerous intersection, as has been pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| Randy Massey, who chairs the Metropolitan Planning Commission and who voted against this, said to me afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| he said, I drive that highway every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| I hope you guys turn this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| That is a dangerous intersection, and this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| The apartment complex, as Mr. Bailey pointed out, there are a lot of what-ifs and maybes, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| If the apartment complex were to agree to a combination of driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| and if TDOT or someone were to come in and pay to build turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8912)|
| 2:28:39| and if someone were to pay to upgrade the traffic signal for a private driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| keep in mind the city has a responsibility to signalize public streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| I don't think we have a responsibility to signalize private driveways entering onto public highways or streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8927)|
| 2:28:55| If all those things happen, then it might function better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| That still doesn't address the concern of conversion of what's now a single-family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8939)|
| 2:29:06| and low-density residential plan through that stretch that the Chapman Highway plan says should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070313?start=8946)|
