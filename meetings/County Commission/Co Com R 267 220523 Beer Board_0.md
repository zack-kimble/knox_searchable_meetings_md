| 0:01:46| I'd like to take a quick second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| This will be a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| but I'd like to add as a discussion item at the very end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| the ordinance that I passed out previously to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| I guess we'll do a vote to make sure that everybody's in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| All those opposed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=123)|

| 0:02:18| Commissioner Jay is the first and Commissioner Bussler is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=140)|
| 0:02:23| And it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=143)|

| 0:02:27| Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=147)|

| 0:02:33| please stand and raise your hand and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=153)|

| 0:02:47| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| And I would add this under the Knox County Charter, Section 2.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| intentionally misleading or lying to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=173)|
| 0:02:56| or any of its committees, which includes the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| makes you guilty of the offense of civil perjury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| and each such offense shall be punishable by a fine of $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you, Director Bouk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=190)|

| 0:03:35| Thank you, Director Bouk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Who's here to represent that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| The procedure here, sir, is that first of all, if you'd state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| My name is John Morrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| And what's your position with Double Dogs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| Director of Operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| And you're here to testify on their behalf in this matter, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| The procedure here today is that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Detective Cole from the Sheriff's Office will state the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| You will then have a chance to admit or deny that allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| and then you will have a chance to address the beer board in any way you see fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| and then the beer board will act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Detective Cole, if you could proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| On Monday, April 11, 2022, at approximately 17, 19 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| the defendant sold to an underage person a light beer for $5.41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| The defendant did this after checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| Did you hear and understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Is there any testimony you'd like to give before the beer board with regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| And first I'd like to let everybody know that I'm on board with everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| This is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| We do not want to serve underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| We are committed at Double Dogs as a team to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| and I'd like to explain what we do just to let you all know that we are trying so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=308)|
| 0:05:16| to take all the human element out of everything to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| It just gets to the point where we just get to the point where there's human error involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| I am not here to say get off my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| I got your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| You know, my team, we've been putting together for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| we've put together a system that's been in play that failed this night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| We have several Double Dogs, and this is our second one that we built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| I come from Bowling Green, and I go to see all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Thursday night is probably our busiest happy hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| Not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| 5.30 is probably the busiest time, not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| We have, obviously, extensive training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| We have scanners to take IDs, to verify them that they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| They're $800 to $1,000 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Each store has three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| There's four at this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| She did not take the ID to verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| She didn't even, obviously, look at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| She's obviously gone and paid her fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| getting her extra training, et cetera, through us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and obviously through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| The main thing we do is every day, twice a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| we implemented this over five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| This is the alcohol awareness sign-in book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Every shift at 11 o'clock, every shift at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| every person signs this form that says what the date is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| and then there's five bullet points on what the day is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| 5-23-01, whatever, you know, the 21 makes it 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| Then they sign it and they date it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| We keep them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I have the person that did the violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| the one she signed on 4-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| We also have stickers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Each person gets a sticker that they put on their server book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| so every time they pull their server book to take an order up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| the 21-years-old date is on the top of their book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| We also have them on the PosiTouch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| This is our computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| We discuss it constantly, and we failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| The only reason I'm even just not rolling over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| and I don't mean to say it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| but I obviously am looking for a little bit of a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=453)|

| 0:07:42| but I'm all about paying the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| I think we did something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=465)|

| 0:07:49| We did something wrong as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| I have a new general manager that took over the store about a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=472)|

| 0:07:59| She is just awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| She's got one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| She cares an awful lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| She's extremely worried about being on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| It's her first store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I told her several years ago that she would move out of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| She was out of the store many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| But due to a tragic situation with my previous GM at that store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| she took over about Easter time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=498)|

| 0:08:27| I really appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I respect everything you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| We failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| We will constantly do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I have confidence in my team that they will not let up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| It's company-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We came up with a slogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I give myself credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| It's called stop, breathe, and read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Probably need to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| I'm a little out of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| But we try to tell them, stop, you're real busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| Take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Look the guest in the eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Get to know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Then read the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Stop, breathe, and read did not happen on 4-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| But it will hopefully from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| But I'm going to knock on wood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=545)|

| 0:09:23| The gentleman mentioned a probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| When we issue a fine, if the fine is paid, there is no probation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=570)|

| 0:09:33| Let's talk about the fine then, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| At this time, I'd like to turn it over to the district commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=577)|

| 0:10:19| Which would you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| We'll pay the fine in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I'd like to make a motion then that we accept his plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| and proceed with the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=626)|

| 0:11:22| but they have since 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Maybe there's something lost in communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| but this board can do what it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| In times past, I think we have given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=691)|

| 0:11:48| I am wondering, as I was dashing in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| I did see some folks getting out of their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| and they didn't look like they probably were employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| and I wondered at the time if they had a small child in a stroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| maybe they weren't trying to make their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=728)|

| 0:12:47| Detective Cole, if you would proceed and give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=767)|

| 0:12:52| conducted a compliance check at Casey's located at 6804 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| The defendant sold a Mountain Dew malt beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| after checking the underage person's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=781)|

| 0:13:08| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Now, if there's anything else you'd like to say to the County Commission here, proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Yeah, we take full responsibility for the actions of our employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| We reprimanded him and made him do retraining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| for all of the alcohol and tobacco selling products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=804)|

| 0:13:31| and then we reprimanded the store manager as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| But, you know, me being with Pilot for 10, 11 years before Casey's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| you know, we've got an outstanding reputation of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=822)|

| 0:19:13| Was there an establishment at this location that received a suspension and or a fine recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1153)|
| 0:19:24| Yes, they had a suspension for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Do you recall which meeting that suspension was imposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| Do we have a copy of that by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1175)|

| 0:19:45| Is this the same applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| Because it would follow with the applicant, not necessarily the premises, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| We had an applicant that came in the month following the suspension, and it was a relative of the original owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1192)|

| 0:21:16| And you'll need codes as well before you come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| I don't see, ma'am, are you with Humphammers or Dollar General by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Oh, wait, you're with Metro Drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| I need new glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I'm half blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Okay, so at this time, if the commission sees it fit, I'd like to move into the portion of other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| Previously to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| We need to take action on the two that are still on the agenda as far as whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Sheriff's Department, when they're cited, these two businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| do they get any follow-up paperwork from your department as far as attending the violation meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Once they're cited, the individual is cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| The person that actually sells to the underage person, they are cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| and they have to appear in court to get fingerprinted and booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| And once they do that, then they'll go in and have their arraignment in front of the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| and they'll set their follow-up court date and anything that they have to do after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| But as far as the business goes, no, they don't represent the business unless they are themselves the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Do we send them a letter then, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Yes, we send them a letter, and I've been sending emails, the emails that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And they get an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I send it to their business and their home and business address, plus I send them an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| They have their email address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| You may want to, as you said, wait until the very end to do anything with those two in case they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| If it's okay with the body, I'd like to move to other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| and give an opportunity for the Dollar General and Humphammers to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| and if they don't, then we'll take action after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So if you'll see before you, I like the ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And honestly, I met with Director Meyer, Director Morton, and not Director Morton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Mike Moyer, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| We spoke about how for years now we've talked about the first offense being $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| the second offense being $1,500 in the period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| I'm going to bring this to commission next month in the form of an ordinance change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| but I'd like to get everybody as a body to weigh in and kind of tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| if there's anything you want me to tweak before I turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| What this does, the biggest change is this takes the fifth offense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| and it amends it to the fourth offense to where it strikes the language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| and substituting where it goes in 36 months of the first to find any self-alcoholic beverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| to minor permit penalties to under this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| So it goes from a fifth offense to a fourth offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| We've not seen a fourth offense while I've been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| I don't know when the last time we've had a fourth offense has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| We have had a third offense, but I'd like to open up the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| We can strike out whatever or add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I just wanted to go ahead and get this on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| so that way we have something kind of backing us up in our ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So if I'm reading this correctly, you're in essence upping the penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| Would it keep the language in there of the either or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| And I imagine like every other ordinance it would go into effect 30 days after the second reading of passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| So we'd have a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| My biggest concern is notâ€”I think upping the fines is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| I think deterring as much as we can the sale of alcohol to underage minors is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1521)|
| 0:25:30| My question is how do youâ€”we probably have thousands and thousands of beer permits issued already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| How do you properly communicate this all toâ€”this is good going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| but I want to make sure that we don't ignore the potential time and cost or necessity from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| Let's say we have 3,000 beer permits that are currently operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| We need to make sure we have a real clear way to communicate to every current beer owner, beer permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| that fines are going up and we're taking this up to another level and in the seriousness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| So I guess what's the communication trail if this were to pass after two would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| Following up with thatâ€”oh, go ahead, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| I have a question that's separate from his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| Do you want me to go with my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| I would just like to answer Commissioner Jay's if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Are these not the numbers we've been assigning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| We've been assigning these numbers for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| This just kind of basically puts it into the ordinance, and I'm just trying to bring everything up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| But this is what we've been kind of doing as practice because our numbers are lower than this by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| So it's just sort of the norm, and you're codifying the norm, which does move it up from the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Let meâ€”is this pretended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| When we first set these fines up, the $1,000 and $1,500, first of all, one of the first cases we ever had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1625)|
| 0:27:17| we started out with $1,000, and I made a statement then that said a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| We cannot go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| And we haven't gone back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| And then we went to these figures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| So the precedent is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| What are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Quantifying this, or are we just saying because we set the precedent, and the precedent takes priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| Yeah, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| We're just trying to get with the law director's office and basically back what we've been doing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Law Director, since we set that precedent, do we need to correct the verbiage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| Well, you had the minimum in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| You had a lot of discretion, and you've been using that discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| What this does is codify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| So that's something we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It codifies what you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Which has been legal, what you've been doing is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| I think this is an excellent idea to get our paperwork updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| This is terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| And then the other thing is, since this now would be public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1708)|
| 0:28:33| we wouldn't have to notify all the beer holders in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| We wouldn't be under any obligation to do that, that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| Because we've got how many beer licenses in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I don't know right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| At least 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Maybe more, but at least 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I just have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| So we pass this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Does it then go to commission to be voted on next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| And then two votes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| This is just me bringing this forward to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| trying to get everybody's input before I bring it forward to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| in June as an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| I was just trying to kind of get the whole team to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| and we could all kind of haul this thing across together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| I support this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| I don't have the ordinances in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| When on letter D, fourth offense is amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| and substituting the term revocation, how long is the revocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1786)|
| 0:29:56| Is that of our, do we set that, Mr. Law Director or Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| The way it reads, it's permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| You as an individual have got your license revoked, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| So then looking at E on fifth offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| if it's revoked forever on fourth offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| help me with what fifth offense is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| We're going to be striking the fifth offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| It will be struck on this ordinance from that day moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I hadn't looked at this before, but I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| There is no fifth offense, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Commissioner Hill, just to clarify your question, I think it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Let's say Bob Smith owns the Quickie Mart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| and he goes through four offenses and he gets his revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| Bob Smith, if he goes and opens a 7-Eleven down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| he couldn't have a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| but he could sell the Quickie Mart to someone else in that operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| obviously, because it follows the person, not the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| So that would just preclude him, but that happens often when people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| but not his family or somebody else you would illegally sell the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| But back to Commissioner Schoonmaker, your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| I know we wouldn't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| but if our goal is continuously every month to continuously express that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1890)|
| 0:31:38| we do not want underage sales to minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| and we've said and we've lectured people and we've talked to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| and we've said, this is really important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| If this body feels like this is a really important issue that we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| put more teeth into, then I think we ought to take the extra step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| If we do pass this through commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I think the beer board chairman or the chairman of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| we ought to work with our partners at Metro Drug and the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| to send everybody that owns a beer permit something of a letter that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| this is serious and we're serious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| And we're moving these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| We're holding you accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Please know that as a body we feel like this is something that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| and we want you to take every effort possible to not have to come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| and get a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| So I know we don't have to, but I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I think we should make a statement and show that we actually take it seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| and it's not just another fine and another fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| because the goal is to have no one show up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And the sheriff's department would love to not have to issue anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| So that's just my two cents about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| What if the beer board took a vote on this as a recommendation to full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| even though we are full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Just for the record, it would show that we took a vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and we were in favor of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| So if you want to make the motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| First off, is there any changes that anybody would like for me to make before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I'd like to make a motion that we send this ordinance change to the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Next, for other business, I've worked with Lieutenant Lawson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| as well as Knox County IT for a little while now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And the website is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| It took a little longer than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| There's a lot of information, a lot of data, a lot of hard work by both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| that got poured into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| And after this meeting, it will be going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| and it will categorize everything from everyone that has passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| all of their undercover stings and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| It will give the name of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And it was a lot of work, but I'm very proud of those guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| and how hard they've worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| That will be coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| You'll be able to see that online this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| And then, as a body, I wanted to ask how you best seen it fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| We'll have to put it on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Would you guys like to see it as a line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| or how would you like to see me place it on the June agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| so we can read it into the record for every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| I think just to spread a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| Spread a record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2067)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| That's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Spread a record of action on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| so that would be the proper parliamentary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Okay, now we're going to move back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Do you have a question, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I wanted to ask the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-beer-board?start=2080)|
