| 2:14:02| That was in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| On the paperwork you provided us, you say this property now is in the 3rd Commission District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8045)|
| 2:14:14| That looks to be an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| Is that a typo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| This might be a typo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| We'll get that addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| And the other parcel was approved at how many dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8064)|
| 2:14:33| The one that's in the 6th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| Yeah, it was approved at three, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| It was far more than this one, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| Three, three and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| Mr. Sanderson, remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| Do you know what the other one is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| It was approved at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| Did you want to weigh in, Ms. Hill, at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| This got by me when I saw the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8097)|
| 2:15:03| But you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| We did go through the property last month, the adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| And I'm satisfied with the proposal that's being presented and have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8108)|
| 2:15:16| We have a proper first from Commissioner Bigg, second from Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| Any further discussion on item number 56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| This is 4-G-21-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8123)|

| 2:15:32| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Good luck with your project, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| I just got notice that we will come back to 55 applicants on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8139)|
| 2:15:43| So we'll read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| Item number 57, 4-C-21-SP, request to Smithville Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8146)|
| 2:15:53| Josh Sanderson for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| from Agricultural to LDR Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| property located at 8107 and 0 Tazewell Pike, parcel ID 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8160)|
| 2:16:07| 11501 and 127 in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8167)|
| 2:16:12| And is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| Once again, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Ms. Brooks, would you â€“ I keep trying to call you Madam Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| but I guess I could call you Madam Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| It seems a little regal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| Ms. Brooks, could you give us the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| the Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| because of changes to the conditions in the area, including a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| the addition of utilities, and intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| at East Emory Road and Tazewell Pike by a vote of 7-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| We'll start by asking the applicant just to describe your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8208)|
| 2:16:52| or provide any relevant information, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| Thank you again, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| Again, Josh Sanderson with Smithville Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| This is an opportunity for Smithville to come out to the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| a community that we're presently moving out of in a subdivision off Ely Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8223)|
| 2:17:09| which is relatively close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| This one is just shy of a mile north of the new Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| We originally asked for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| Obviously that was way too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| Was kind of not shocked, but we were thinking with the new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| we would be encouraged to come out there and, you know, you want some more homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| You want the economy to follow that school just as it did in Horn Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8253)|
| 2:17:40| So we're compromising at two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| That will allow us to build 142 homes as opposed to one unit an acre at 71 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| One misconception that I've talked to a lot of the nearby residents was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| whether you zone at one unit an acre or ten units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| the product that people can afford is the same size lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| It's a 55 foot by 100 foot lot with a $230,000 to $300,000 house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8284)|
| 2:18:13| If you zone at one unit an acre, we're not going to do one acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| That just people can't afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| We can't afford to put them in, and they can't afford to buy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| So just zoning at one unit an acre, people automatically think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| oh, they're going to do bigger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| Well, if you zone at one unit an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| all we're going to do is just the same lot, just less of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| If we do less of them, we don't have to do the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| We won't install any common areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| I'm saying we won't because we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8314)|
| 2:18:36| The economies of scale at 71 lots, people can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| To take care of a pool, walking trails, sidewalks, a playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| all that stuff HOA has to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| You need economies of scale to people to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| So you can't go sell a $200,000 house and then tell people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| oh, you have a $200-a-month HOA fee because they're already max budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| So our product, the Smithfield Homes product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| right now on average about $230,000, fits that mold for the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| and we think it fits good there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| We think that allowing us that two units an acre, we will do common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| We will have a concept plan that will show green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| will show sidewalks, will show things that benefit the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| as opposed to just giving us one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| We'll go in there with one drive and just having the lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| and obviously Knox County will have approval on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| but against the traffic study and some of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| that the area won't benefit from with the lesser zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8371)|
| 2:19:35| We're not going to go in there and cut up the entire acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8375)|
| 2:19:42| We're going to use the acreage that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| and maybe even have some larger tracks that back up to Campbell's Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| Campbell's Point is a first-class, really nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| Don't quote me on this, but the 20 acres or 30 acres on that side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| will be larger tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| We won't be butting right up against Campbell's Point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| with a $250,000 house to their $500,000 house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| So I know there's concern there to protect their privacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| and protect their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| and that's what we plan to do with our concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| Again, we would like to move forward with the two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| with your all's permission, do the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8415)|
| 2:20:18| get with engineering, do a well-thought-out master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8418)|
| 2:20:21| show the 140 lots with common area, with a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| with amenities that help sell the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| We don't need any help selling houses right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| but it would be nice to get something out there in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| what people are asking for around this new school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| because people want to move out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| We get phone calls all over the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| I'm sure Commissioner Beeler can adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| People want to move to this area, and they can only afford so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8440)|
| 2:20:43| That's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| So I will yield the rest of my time for any comments and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8444)|

| 2:20:48| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| Mr. Murphy, if you would, join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| We're going to reset the clock at five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| and if you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman, Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| My remarks are on behalf of the Knox County Planning Alliance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| I'm specifically addressing the request to change the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| from agricultural to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| I want to give you some quick context on the northeast county land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| It was updated recently in terms of land use plans in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8477)|
| 2:21:22| There was a survey and then seven public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| Attendees expressed concerns about a loss of farmland to residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| increased traffic volume on rural roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| and a desire for a new middle school in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| Sixty-seven percent of survey respondents desired the use of conservation subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| in the northeast sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| I was at five of those seven meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| There was extensive discussion about the desired character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| and land use designations for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| And by for this area, I particularly mean the area north and east of Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| extending down to Coryton and then back down Washington Pike towards the Rita community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| This overwhelmingly talked about the unique character of northeast Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| and its rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| As a result, when the land use plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| a deliberate conscious decision put the agricultural designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8531)|
| 2:22:15| on almost all that land outside of the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| except for the Coryton Village and the Washington Pike and Roberts Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| So this was a really deliberate designation for that sea of green agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| that you see on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| Page one of that sector plan accurately reports that many residents choose to live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| for the rural setting, and on that same page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8555)|
| 2:22:38| it represents that they are concerned about the balance between future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8558)|
| 2:22:42| and protecting the qualities inherent to the northeast county sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| which includes the rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| And that's on the first page of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| And so that's a really important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| This blanket of agricultural designation for that rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| accurately represents the desire of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| and was approved by planning commission and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| But now to the request in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| Planning commissioners voted seven to five for a rural residential recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| That's seven to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| That's one vote is all that passed by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| This went against a professional staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| which they recommended against no sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| and they noted that there are no parcels in the entire northeast sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8601)|
| 2:23:25| that are designated rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8605)|
| 2:23:28| So the amendment for a plan has to meet four requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8608)|
| 2:23:31| either one of four requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| There has to be a change in conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| introduction of significant roads or utilities that weren't anticipated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| an obvious or significant error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| or trends in development, population, or traffic that weren't reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| Planning commissioners in their motion, they cited number one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| like a change in conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| They noted that there's a new middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| and that there's been some improvements at Tazewell Pike and Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| but respectfully the conditions haven't changed beyond what was anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| in the 2015 plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| The middle school was built, but the 2015 plan anticipated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8644)|
| 2:24:08| The memorandum of understanding was already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| and the location had already been identified for where that was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| So this was fully anticipated in the sector plan on page 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| The improvements in Tazewell Pike and Emory Road were already underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| and scheduled for completion in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| So there is no change in conditions to warrant a sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| There wasn't an error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| That large swath of agricultural designation was intentional and deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| And finally, the last reason you could do it is new trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8678)|
| 2:24:44| that may warrant reconsideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| but the trend of farmland disappearing to low-density sprawling residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| is not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8690)|
| 2:24:51| It's extensively discussed in the sector plan and raised as concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8691)|
| 2:24:56| This sector plan and encouraging residential north of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| will actually increase traffic through the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| Workers, that's the only way that they can get into the employment areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| It's also in the parental responsibility zone for the middle school and the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| so the students have to walk there and there's no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| The only way is the students are going to have to be driven in private vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| So what we haven't seen is new things called out in the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8720)|
| 2:25:24| that could help developments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| Large agricultural zones, cluster rural residential, conservation subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| transfer development rights, and we haven't implemented any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| Those are the tools that could help us do development like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| but we don't have that in our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| So we request you deny this proposed sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| We encourage you to fully participate in the general plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| That's the way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| Add some of these tools in as part of that general plan update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| that allows us to both develop and preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| and then that's the right time to consider a request for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8755)|
| 2:25:59| So we just say that this sector plan represents how we, the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8759)|
| 2:26:03| want to see from planning and development in the northeast sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| and request that you deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8768)|
| 2:26:09| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8769)|
| 2:26:14| We'll open up the floor for discussion before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| unless Commissioner Bailey wants to take the lead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8777)|
| 2:26:20| Is this Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| I had a question for Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8782)|
| 2:26:33| Yes, sir, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| At one point in time we were talking about some of the things that Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| and I were actually talking about, about implementing Hawk's Nest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| and stuff like that so the additional traffic could be compensated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| whenever we go between Gibbs Middle and Gibbs High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| We talked about bridge and stuff like that for that route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8808)|
| 2:26:51| so traffic wouldn't be that big of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| Can you give us a bit of an update on that and where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| We have in the mobility plan 2045 have applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| and actually was recommended and approved by the TPO executive board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| to have a pedestrian crossing bridge there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| much like what Commissioner Bailey has in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| Obviously, there's some, I guess, during football times and things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| there is some pedestrian traffic that crosses the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| I think there's times where school children cross there too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| due to some common and shared athletic facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| We certainly want those to be grade separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| and we're looking, we have that in the mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8853)|
| 2:27:36| and also looking, maybe some of the upcoming federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8856)|
| 2:27:40| to try to secure that location to improve the pedestrian safety there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| because we do have sidewalks all along the, I guess that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| you consider the west side of Tazeville Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| from the elementary school, middle school, all the way to Harbison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8871)|
| 2:27:54| We're looking at doing some other sidewalk improvements there at the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| I think the state built some bike lanes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| but there's not sidewalks actually at the intersection and some handicap ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| So we're trying to figure out some ways to do some pedestrian improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| there at the interchange or intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| So a lot of that was brought on by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| I know that Chairman Jay got these emails too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| there was a subdivision called Edwards Place Subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| that was located at the back of the new middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| So a lot of these road upgrades, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| and talking about the crosswalks and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| are hinged upon a lot of the stuff that was brought up by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8907)|
| 2:28:30| But are we going to try to get the multimodal grant for that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| or is that even something that we could do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8914)|
| 2:28:37| Yeah, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| We apply for those routinely when they come in through the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| Certainly we try to leverage as much of those federal grant dollars as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| We're trying to build some connection linkages from a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8926)|
| 2:28:50| on the opposite side of Thompson School Road from Edwards Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| and ultimately make connections from the subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8935)|
| 2:28:59| both on the east and west sides of Thompson School all the way to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8939)|
| 2:29:03| So to that effect, we are trying to provide for multimodal connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8943)|
| 2:29:07| from the new subdivisions to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8947)|
| 2:29:10| So the PRZ is going to be kind of handled and maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| a little bit better than it currently is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| We're doing our very best to make those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| We do have one more opponent out here, I believe, that he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| Oh, okay, I didn't realize you were with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| If you'd like to come speak, sir, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| I do have a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| I'm going to reset the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| Mr. Sanderson, I'll give you extra time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| If you would state your name and your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| Sorry about that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| My name is Alan Chase, 7824 Staley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8982)|
| 2:29:50| And the floor is yours, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8990)|
| 2:29:57| First of all, thank you for allowing me the chance to voice my opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=8997)|
| 2:30:00| to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9000)|
| 2:30:04| My home is on four acres of land to the west of this proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9004)|
| 2:30:09| I realize that I'm late in stating my opposition to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| but with the effects of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| I thought that the commission meetings were virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| because we have the technology to get online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| The parcel of land for the subdivision is 76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9021)|
| 2:30:24| It's a large tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| I believe that a small subdivision could be designed to be tucked inside the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| with minimal disruption to adjoining property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| When I saw the plans for the two-unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| it shows that approximately 16 homes are laid out with their back lawns to my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| My house sits 150 acres from that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| 150 feet from that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9054)|
| 2:30:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| So you can see I'm in real close proximity to that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9058)|
| 2:31:02| And the proposal is for 16 properties, houses, next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| I've had 30 years of living there with a horse farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| Very, very private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9072)|
| 2:31:14| And now with this subdivision coming in, things are going to change drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9074)|
| 2:31:24| Josh said that he'd talked to the adjacent landowners about this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9084)|
| 2:31:29| He never spoke once to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| Nobody has contacted me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| He said that he was making a buffer for the Camel Point subdivision people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| to a big tract of land to buffer the subdivision from their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| He's not doing that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9103)|
| 2:31:47| He's putting 16 houses where I can see and hear everybody in their backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9107)|
| 2:31:55| I realize that as one property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| I may not have the clout that Camel Point residents have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| but I feel that a large lot buffer would be provided between my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| and the subdivision as he's done for Camel Point subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| So that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| I'm not in opposition to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| I wish it wasn't coming, but if it is, I wish it was either redesigned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| or approved for the one dwelling per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9144)|
| 2:32:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9146)|
| 2:32:27| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9147)|
| 2:32:32| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9153)|
| 2:32:36| Amy, I read through the staff recommendations before this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| and it says deny the northeast county sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| It does not meet any of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| The light sector plan was done in 2015, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| 2016?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| That's correct, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9174)|
| 2:32:55| And there's been no new sewer, no new roads, no new anything there since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9175)|
| 2:33:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| Yeah, it's not that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9183)|
| 2:33:04| I mean, there were the intersection improvements that were noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9184)|
| 2:33:06| by the planning commission at East Emory and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| I can't speak to the exact date of those intersection improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| Mr. Snowden, do you know of any improvements up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9192)|
| 2:33:19| No road improvements that I'm aware of that haven't been previously mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9199)|
| 2:33:23| How far is the sewer from this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| Josh, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| It's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| Campbell Point's on sewer, so it crosses right in front of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9211)|
| 2:33:35| So it's there at the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| And, of course, you all know that I'm a sector plan guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9218)|
| 2:33:45| You live by the sector plan, you die by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9225)|
| 2:33:49| I do have a problem with the planning commission stating that there's new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9229)|
| 2:33:56| there's something there new to change the northeast county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9236)|
| 2:34:02| which I don't see and I don't agree with what they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| what their argument is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| Maybe I'm not in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| It's just according to what this commission thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| If it does get by this, then it's really going to come down to what type of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| how many per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| Commissioner Bielan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Ms. Brooks, has this development been through the planning process yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9269)|
| 2:34:36| The development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| No, it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9279)|
| 2:34:40| So we don't know for sure yet where the houses are going to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| I mean, it hasn't been approved, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| I mean, there's still another step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| Well, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9293)|
| 2:34:58| This is one that I have been thinking on and praying on for a month, two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9298)|
| 2:35:05| ever since it came out of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9305)|
| 2:35:08| I think this development is a classic example of the tension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9308)|
| 2:35:14| Kevin and I have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| that exists between the need for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9316)|
| 2:35:24| and the reasons that people don't want to see growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9324)|
| 2:35:29| I've lived in the Gibbs community all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| In fact, I live north of the school at Harbison's Crossroads, just off Casual Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9331)|
| 2:35:40| I'm well aware of the desire for a middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9340)|
| 2:35:44| and the desire to preserve the rural character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9344)|
| 2:35:52| There are a lot of people that want to live in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| And it's not just new people from outside the community wanting to move to Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9356)|
| 2:36:01| There are people from other parts of Gibbs that want to live in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9361)|
| 2:36:06| There are children of people who have grown up in Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| and are now married that want to stay in Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9370)|
| 2:36:13| They don't want to have to leave the community to buy a new home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9373)|
| 2:36:18| And we're in a housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| I really do respect the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| I'm more than appreciative of Kevin and Kim Frazier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9388)|
| 2:36:31| and the whole group of those folks that are an invaluable asset to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9391)|
| 2:36:41| I know there's concern that if this sector plan is changed for this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| there's going to be a precedent for essentially polka-dotting the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9407)|
| 2:36:53| with other sector plan changes in individual parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9413)|
| 2:36:58| My feeling on this particular parcel, because of its location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9418)|
| 2:37:02| it doesn't border the planned growth area, but it's pretty close to adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9422)|
| 2:37:08| It's within a mile, less than a mile, of the school campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| To me, this development is a precedent when it comes to quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9433)|
| 2:37:25| but an exception when it comes to quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9445)|
| 2:37:29| In my view, if we were to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| that does not mean that we would have to approve a sector plan amendment for every parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| in Gibbs or Coryton or East Knox County or south or anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| I do believe that the building of the middle school had an intrinsic effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9461)|
| 2:37:47| that really transcends data and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9467)|
| 2:37:51| It simply made the community a more desirable place for people to want to move to and stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9471)|
| 2:38:04| My hope is that Josh and the folks at Smithville can perhaps work with Mr. Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9484)|
| 2:38:13| But I believe we need this development in Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9493)|
| 2:38:17| and I'm going to make a motion that we approve this sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| per the recommendation of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9502)|
| 2:38:26| and we'll deal with density, I suppose, in the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9513)|

| 2:38:35| So we have a first by Commissioner Beeler, second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| Is there additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9522)|

| 2:40:18| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| Ms. Brooks, you'll start us off with the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| up to two dwelling units per acre by a vote of 11-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| Would you like to add anything to the testimony, sir, Mr. Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| I'm going to get with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| We're going to trade contact information, and if a buffer's what he needs, a buffer's what he don't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9640)|
| 2:40:44| So we'll make sure we take care of our surrounding landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| Did you hear that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9646)|
| 2:40:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9648)|
| 2:40:49| Mr. Murphy, would you like to address the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| Put the timer back at five minutes, and if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| we'll reserve five minutes for the applicant as well after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9658)|
| 2:40:59| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| I would like to call out to your attention what you could be considering but can't consider right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9663)|
| 2:41:10| So I talked a little bit about the tools that have been called out in the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9670)|
| 2:41:15| South County Sector Plan, Northeast County Sector Plan, that have been identified as useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9675)|
| 2:41:21| but nobody's taking the time to actually put them into our toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| One of those tools would be a, and this plan was called a Cluster Rural Residential Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9686)|
| 2:41:32| That's one that would actually allow you to put, you know, houses in one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| and then do transfer development rights or conservation easement or something to, you know, protect another section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| while also getting a density bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9706)|
| 2:41:49| And actually that's about three tools in one, but those are tools that would really help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| because plan residential at two units an acre, I think we all can agree that this is actually what causes sprawl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9714)|
| 2:42:02| and the kind of development that doesn't help Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| It's more, you know, consumes as much land as possible for as few people as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| with potentially as little amenities as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| So that's, you know, I'm just using this time to call out that this is exactly where these tools would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| If the Transfer Development Rights Program existed, then the applicant could come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9741)|
| 2:42:29| They could have entered into a transfer agreement with another property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9749)|
| 2:42:33| where the applicant could actually pay that property owner for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9753)|
| 2:42:38| the couple of units per acre on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| That property owner then loses that in the future, but that allows it to stay farmland, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9761)|
| 2:42:48| Whereas now they'd be able to build something denser closer to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9768)|
| 2:42:52| So that's how you can have your cake and you can eat it too is with tools like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| where you can put density on parcels where, you know, there is some amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| and some education and some infrastructure while at the same time allowing you to preserve other parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| with that rural character and open space that is what gives Knox County a sense of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9788)|
| 2:43:13| So I just encourage you that will help you in the future in situations like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| to, you know, if you will adopt and add those tools to the toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9804)|
| 2:43:25| Mr. Mayor, I've got a question while you're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| What do you suggest for the PRZ zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| I'm not sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| So you're talking about specific density and amenities and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| but in situations like this, what do you suggest for PRZ zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9819)|
| 2:43:43| For the Permanent Responsibility Zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9823)|
| 2:43:46| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9826)|
| 2:43:49| In terms of, you know, what should the desired density be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| Well, not just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| Where we're looking at an instance where we're having an opportunity to, we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9834)|
| 2:43:59| do you know the numbers of Gibbs Middle by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| So we're taking an opportunity to put some growth out there in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9843)|
| 2:44:07| I'm just wondering, you know, you brought up the PRZ zones and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| but what's the correct answer for walkability or bikeability to your schools out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| Would you suggest getting TDOT involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9857)|
| 2:44:21| What would be the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| Well, for that it would seem that we're missing simply a sidewalk connection going north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| putting sidewalks in on the public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9867)|
| 2:44:31| So if Mr. Sanderson were to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| yeah, we'll include sidewalk into this specific parcel when needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| would stuff like that make you feel better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| And we kind of just, as the development comes, we go and do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9881)|
| 2:44:46| Or what would you suggest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9886)|
| 2:44:47| So sidewalks in this case would help alleviate any development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| no matter what the density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Right now it's going to be 100% vehicular for all student transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| So sidewalks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| a sidewalk that actually went north from the schools along Tassel Pike to that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| would at least alleviate some of the impact of any development up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9904)|
| 2:45:09| So that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9914)|
| 2:45:15| Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9915)|
| 2:45:16| I was just going to mention that Knox County did establish a Transfer of Development Rights Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9916)|
| 2:45:24| I believe Ms. Starbuck served on that years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| and it didn't go anywhere for a lot of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9927)|
| 2:45:31| So I just didn't know if you were aware of that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| I am, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9933)|
| 2:45:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| And then Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| The professional staff recommended how many dwelling units per acre for this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9938)|
| 2:45:43| One dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And the commissioners moved for two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9949)|
| 2:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9950)|
| 2:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9952)|
| 2:45:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9954)|
| 2:45:55| Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9955)|
| 2:45:59| do you know off the top of your head the amount of sidewalk construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9959)|
| 2:46:04| we're going to be doing in the Carter School area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| I know the dollar amount, but do you know the linear amount of sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| It's over a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| I think it's actually somewhat, or probably a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9976)|
| 2:46:19| maybe around 6,000 linear feet or something like that to connect the elementary, middle, and high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| as well as the park and the library and the senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| So I think it's around 6,000 feet, Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9987)|
| 2:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| If we do rezone this to PR, the development will have sidewalks, will it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=9991)|
| 2:46:40| It is in the, I guess, Tazewell Park's in the PRZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10000)|
| 2:46:44| So per the sidewalk ordinance, they will be required to construct it along their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10004)|
| 2:46:50| Because we were wanting it, you know, we kind of prioritized it along the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| to serve as a transportation feature rather than maybe necessarily an amenity for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| They can still do the sidewalks internal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10018)|
| 2:47:01| but it would be the responsibility of the homeowners to maintain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10021)|
| 2:47:04| But, yes, we will be asking Josh to build them along the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10024)|
| 2:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10027)|
| 2:47:10| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| Jim, is that, you know, we just passed the sidewalk at a quarter of a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10033)|
| 2:47:18| Was it a quarter of a mile last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10038)|
| 2:47:22| Yes, I think it, and I'm going off memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| anything in the PRZ that's developed along their frontages has to be constructed sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10045)|
| 2:47:31| and I think it's a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10051)|
| 2:47:33| My brain is not working very well this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| Yeah, so, and it can be a commercial generator or a public park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10056)|
| 2:47:43| or anything that would generate pedestrian traffic that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| that would be created by that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| I'm not familiar with the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| Commissioner Beeler probably can help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10075)|
| 2:47:57| So, I guess, Commissioner, at the four-way there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10077)|
| 2:48:04| tell me where it's at and what businesses are close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| I know we've got the Weigels, we've got all that section right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| so help me there, then I've got another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10092)|
| 2:48:14| As far as relative to this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| Well, you go north from the four-way on Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| you go through the school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| and then it's about a little less than a mile on up Tazewell Pike from the school on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10103)|
| 2:48:30| So, there's really no commercial business there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10110)|
| 2:48:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10112)|
| 2:48:33| The only reason to do a sidewalk would sound like a sidewalk to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10113)|
| 2:48:39| Josh had to put one in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10119)|
| 2:48:41| Isn't there a rural park right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10121)|
| 2:48:43| Yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10123)|
| 2:48:44| There's a park there, too, so there's a couple of different aspects of the ordinance we've adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10124)|
| 2:48:49| There is a community park roughly halfway between the school and this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| So, it'll be up to the taxpayers to build that sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10133)|
| 2:48:57| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10137)|
| 2:48:58| Well, what we hope to do, Commissioner, is to create these segments that are constructed by the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| and then we come in and kind of finish up the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10144)|
| 2:49:07| So, that's our long-term hope, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10147)|
| 2:49:10| Hey, Josh, it might have been on the prior one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| but did you say your lots are going to be 55 by 120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10155)|
| 2:49:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10159)|
| 2:49:20| Even on if you've got two per acre, you're still going 55 by 120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10160)|
| 2:49:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| That's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| It's not much of a lot, really, but we're talking 122 houses, 123 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10171)|
| 2:49:38| Yeah, and it's what people want now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10178)|
| 2:49:41| It's what people afford now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| They want to go see the pool and the clubhouse and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| Their yard isâ€”we can't give them what we give them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10185)|
| 2:49:50| I don't know if thatâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| Well, hopefully you'll work with Mr. Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| Oh, no, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| And Knox County staff has been incredible with any of these joint projects or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| If something, if we can extend sidewalk past our frontage down to the community park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| we'll be more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10205)|
| 2:50:06| If it makes sense for us, we'd be more than happy to participate in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10206)|
| 2:50:08| We're all about investing in the community as the community invests in us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10208)|
| 2:50:13| and that's something thatâ€”we've been here for 55 years, and we're going to stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| want to stay here, and we'll do projects like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| I can't commit footage right now of what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| but Jim knows and we'll sit at the conference table and we'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10222)|
| 2:50:25| here's what we need, and we'll be more than happy to participate in any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| Well, hopefully you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| The development that's going on on John Spear Highway, Mr. Smith, Perry Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| no relation, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| You know, he agreed that part of his agreement was that he would have at least a minimum 35-foot forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10239)|
| 2:50:48| just don't cut the trees, around the boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| And I think it was 50 feet on just over John Spear Highway that he would leave those tree buffers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10251)|
| 2:50:57| So I don't know what that property looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| but if you could help him out with leaving the trees as much as possible, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10259)|
| 2:51:05| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10265)|
| 2:51:06| We would be more than happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10266)|
| 2:51:07| We'll abide, obviously, by the â€“ we're getting into too much detail right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| but the width of the property takes one road, lots on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10272)|
| 2:51:15| There's going to be deep lots, so there's no sense we don't need to come in there and cold cut the whole entire thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| So we'd be more than happy there in the concept plan to work with any of the landowners surrounding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10284)|
| 2:51:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Kevin, I do agree with a lot of what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| I really respect, though, Smithville, in this case particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10293)|
| 2:51:40| trying to be sensitive to the environment around it, the people around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10300)|
| 2:51:49| Sometimes â€“ and I know that you all know what I'm saying when I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10309)|
| 2:51:59| representing District 6, we tend to kind of talk out of both sides of our mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10319)|
| 2:52:04| I mean, we talk about how we need new â€“ we need improvements, we need new schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10324)|
| 2:52:13| and then because there's too many people out there, so in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10333)|
| 2:52:18| you kind of try to do it right and you build the school, and then people come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10338)|
| 2:52:25| want to be out there, and that creates the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| We talk about the need for cluster development, that type of concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| so that there's more green space or undeveloped space around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| Some might argue that what Smithville's putting in here is almost a cluster development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| If you consider how many acres they have and how really small amount of property of that acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| it sounds like it's being developed. Is that correct, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10374)|
| 2:52:59| So that sounds to me like there's a whole lot of acreage left in that parcel that is not being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10379)|
| 2:53:11| Two per acre, I've got to tell you, in my end of the county, that sounds like a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10391)|
| 2:53:19| You know, I mean, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| So this Gibbs area might be the perfect area to really start more of what, Kevin, you're referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10401)|
| 2:53:31| and Mr. Buehler, you also, because it isn't totally â€“ it isn't highly developed just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10411)|
| 2:53:40| It sounds like the Smithville operation is probably one of the more recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| or newer areas coming in with that type of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| So, you know, maybe we've got a real shot here to doing it right in that part of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10431)|
| 2:54:00| And, Josh, I do applaud you for already being willing to reach out to that property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| because I have found, as much as there might be a butting of heads out in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10444)|
| 2:54:11| whenever something specifically like that is addressed by surrounding property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10451)|
| 2:54:21| that they seem very intent on trying to make everyone happy and try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10461)|
| 2:54:28| So I have no problem at all supporting this at two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10468)|
| 2:54:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| Commissioner Daly, I think, if I'm doing the math, it's going to be over 150 homes, not 120 at two per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10477)|
| 2:54:45| And then, Commissioner Buehler, I'd like to know what your position is on the zoning density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10485)|
| 2:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| You know, my position is, I believe, as Josh pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| I think two per acre makes more sense because of the opportunity for amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10498)|
| 2:55:05| You know, I look at Shannon Valley Farms as kind of a prototypical neighborhood in terms of a good neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10505)|
| 2:55:12| It's not in the immediate Gibbs community, but it's in most of the Gibbs school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10512)|
| 2:55:19| Do you know off the top of your head what the lot sizes are in Shannon Valley Farms, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10519)|
| 2:55:24| Those would be 65-footers and 75-footers, so a little bit larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10524)|
| 2:55:28| Slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10528)|
| 2:55:29| Slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10529)|
| 2:55:30| Yeah, and I think the thing about Shannon Valley Farms is if it was one per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10530)|
| 2:55:36| you certainly would not have room for the green space and the pool and the clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10536)|
| 2:55:40| and all the amenities they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| And, frankly, I know folks in Shannon Valley Farms that have a beautiful eight-acre tract of property to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10542)|
| 2:55:48| and they're going to build on it, but they don't want to leave Shannon Valley Farms because of their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| and all the amenities that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| So, yeah, my feeling is two per acre is better than one in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10553)|
| 2:55:58| because of the opportunity for better buffer zones for the neighbors and amenities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10558)|
| 2:56:07| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| Josh, since we're talking about what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| are you guys looking for any further development within that PRZ zone out there right now of any property you may have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10573)|
| 2:56:21| Nothing that we have under contract, but we're always looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| Seeing no other lights, I'll look to Commissioner Buehler for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| Motion to approve per the Planning Commission's recommendation at 2 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10599)|
| 2:56:40| Second by Commissioner Ward, first by Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10600)|
| 2:56:43| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Good luck with your project, sir, and we will look forward to seeing you help your neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10610)|
| 2:56:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| On page 14, item number 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| Could I have a little latitude for a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| I wanted to make a comment about the two previous items that were deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10626)|
| 2:57:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| Can you refer to those items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| This was agenda item 3A21SP and 3D21RZ, Applicant, Home Federal Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10638)|
| 2:57:27| Several residents in the area of the Bexhill and Ebenezer Road corridor reached out to me this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10647)|
| 2:57:34| They were just very, very disappointed that the representative from Home Federal Bank decided to defer the application till June for both items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10654)|
| 2:57:50| The community spent the entire weekend out there knocking on doors, talking to their neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10670)|
| 2:57:57| and putting out flyers to try to get them to come downtown this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10677)|
| 2:58:02| And they just felt like an entity like Home Federal Bank and their representative, who is a professional in land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10682)|
| 2:58:12| should have basically given notice on Friday afternoon and not at the 11th hour of actually 11 o'clock this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10692)|
| 2:58:20| So from 11 o'clock this morning, they had to scramble around and undo everything that they had done over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10700)|
| 2:58:28| And it just was not fair to the community out there when they've worked so hard on an issue that's very, very important to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10708)|
| 2:58:36| and to have something pulled out from under them at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| It just was not very professional, and it didn't go down well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| So I'm assured that they will be here in full force in June because of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10725)|
| 2:58:52| So thank you for allowing me the opportunity to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| Yeah, and look, I'm going to jump into this just because it was talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10736)|
| 2:59:01| because I have been in touch with both Home Federal and Hall-Rob who had this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10741)|
| 2:59:06| The goal is to try to find a compromise and a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10746)|
| 2:59:12| And a week ago today, I sat down with both Home Federal and Hall-Rob and tried to find a way to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10752)|
| 2:59:23| That evening, I spent time with community representatives to try to find a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| And all of last week, they were open to a friendly 30-day deferral if the community wanted to engage in the dialogue, engage in some negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10768)|
| 2:59:40| And ultimately on Friday, the community leadership said they weren't interested in engaging in any further negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10780)|
| 2:59:49| And so the weekend spilled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| That was Friday at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| And the applicant, represented by Mr. Mullins, Hall-Rob, the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| still are interested in trying to find a way to work with the community to find a productive path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10800)|
| 3:00:06| And so they delayed it 30 days to continue to open the dialogue, to explore other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| But at some point, just because I've been in the middle of this for a week as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| the community has to decide do they want to engage in a productive dialogue to see if they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10816)|
| 3:00:20| as the gentleman in the back is holding up his thing, save their field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10820)|
| 3:00:24| But we also are a community that has property rights and we have ownership, and it doesn't just magically happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10824)|
| 3:00:30| Everybody needs to sit down at the table and find a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10830)|
| 3:00:33| I've offered as much time as necessary to help sit down between all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| Everyone else has, but I don't think it was disingenuous for the applicant to pull it out from under the rug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10838)|
| 3:00:44| They're trying to find a way forward, but they need time to sit down and have a productive dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| And that was their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| So I'm just going to stick up for the other side as well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| I'm going to go back to number 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10856)|
| 3:00:59| Is that the one that the applicant was in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10859)|
| 3:01:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=10864)|

| 3:09:37| to MDR Medium Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| Property located at 0 Midcrest Drive, parcel ID 119EC01912 in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11379)|
| 3:09:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11391)|

| 3:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| Can I ask that all of you, one's going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| Who's going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11408)|
| 3:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| I'll call you up in a moment, so thank you for having a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11411)|
| 3:10:15| We'll start with the recommendation from Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| to MDR Medium Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| because it is compatible with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11424)|
| 3:10:26| and provides additional opportunity for residential housing in an area adjacent to the urban growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11426)|
| 3:10:31| of the growth policy plan by a vote of 10-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| First, before we start the conversation on this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11436)|
| 3:10:38| I want to offer a sincere apology from Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11438)|
| 3:10:42| who had a very last-minute family emergency that started right before our Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11442)|
| 3:10:47| He was called away for something quite severe that he needed to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11447)|
| 3:10:53| and he apologizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| He hates missing meetings and he hates missing votes, certainly things in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| I've spent a good amount of time on this project as well, so I'll be happy to take the lead on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| Let's start with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11463)|
| 3:11:04| If you would, I'm going to put five minutes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11464)|
| 3:11:06| and if you would talk to us about your project and tell us about what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11466)|
| 3:11:10| and then we'll hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| I'll be as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| The commissioners have a copy of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| I emailed them already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| The property basically is 1.67 acres sandwiched between Crestwood Hills subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11479)|
| 3:11:24| and Walker Springs Apartments, and it's a remnant piece that was never part of either, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11484)|
| 3:11:28| Crestwood Hills was developed in the early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| This property was since sold to a company called GKR Development, which had been bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11491)|
| 3:11:37| The county inherited the property back through delinquent taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11497)|
| 3:11:40| It was in a tax sale, and Charlie and Sherry Morgan, who resided across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11500)|
| 3:11:44| bought the property in 1996 for $9,000 in a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| Since that time, the property has basically been abandoned and disrepaired, and it's overgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11509)|
| 3:11:54| It's become sort of a nuisance, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| I've known Mr. Morgan for probably 30 years, and I was looking for parcels near the bike trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| near county parks, saw the parcel, called him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11520)|
| 3:12:03| He didn't live there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11523)|
| 3:12:04| He moved away in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11524)|
| 3:12:06| Now, he told me about the parcel to provide screening between his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| which is directly at Mead Crest, across the street to the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11529)|
| 3:12:13| So when I purchased it, I closed on it back in April, started cleaning the property up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11533)|
| 3:12:19| discovered there's been a homeless camp there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11539)|
| 3:12:20| We removed tents and chairs and tables and a whole lot of mess there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| hired an arborist to come in and mark the dead trees that were dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11544)|
| 3:12:28| completely dead that were going to fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| And then once we got that cleaned out, we came back with an arborist a second time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11550)|
| 3:12:34| and had him mark the trees that are not going to survive once we got the dead stuff cleared away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11554)|
| 3:12:38| So that was basically the beginning of the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| From there, I started researching, you know, what the right development plan might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| residential uses between two residential complexes, and sort of surmised there's four options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11565)|
| 3:12:51| There's single-family homes to detached villas to attached condos to apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| you know, and sort of intensity of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| and sort of quickly determined that the best use is the second of the four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| which is detached product for a lot of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| the biggest reason being having separation, more woods, more trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11583)|
| 3:13:07| The development concept is to build a detached product, two-story, three-bedroom, two-bath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11587)|
| 3:13:12| half-bath downstairs, and then centralized parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11592)|
| 3:13:16| So instead of having a lot of driveways going out to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11596)|
| 3:13:19| have a centralized parking lot encompassed by trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11599)|
| 3:13:22| and you leave the houses in the trees with boardwalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| It's sort of like a houses in the woods kind of concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11604)|
| 3:13:27| It's a good compromise when you're trying to get balance between a residential area and apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11607)|
| 3:13:31| And so that's sort of the development idea behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| I took all those options and summarized that into a development package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11614)|
| 3:13:39| went door-to-door to every neighbor that I touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| and knocked on the door, handed the package to them, and let them know what I was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| And then from there, we went to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| We already had their ideas on it and the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| Went to MPC, got approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11632)|
| 3:13:53| Went to MPC vote and got approval as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| And so this is the follow-up, obviously, to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| Everything else is pretty much reiterated in this plan that I've sent to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| and sent to county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| So I'll yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| Thank you, Mr. Atkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11645)|
| 3:14:06| I'll hold two minutes, 13, for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11646)|
| 3:14:08| Sir, if you would join us at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11648)|
| 3:14:11| if you would state your name and your address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11651)|
| 3:14:14| and we will reset the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11654)|
| 3:14:17| My name is Kevin Rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| I live at 713 East Mead Crest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11659)|
| 3:14:26| Thank you, commissioners, who have answered our calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11666)|
| 3:14:29| and provided input on the process, visited with us at the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| and heard our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11673)|
| 3:14:35| This is much appreciated for our group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| that has never needed to be involved at this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11677)|
| 3:14:43| East Mead Crest Drive is a low-density street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11683)|
| 3:14:48| It's Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11688)|
| 3:14:53| We would like to request a deferral so that we may further understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| Mr. Atkins' stormwater management plan with regards to how this may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11696)|
| 3:15:00| to be altered by the EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11700)|
| 3:15:02| If the property didn't already have so many drainage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| along with what will be added to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| then this would be more straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| If the EPW identifies significant adjustments such that density must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| altered, then why would this commission increase the density to the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11714)|
| 3:15:19| amount that is being recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11719)|

| 3:16:50| We recognize that as the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| it is his prerogative to develop this land in any way he'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11812)|

| 3:17:59| existing stormwater drainage for the property, that significant adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11879)|

| 3:18:19| Since this trench has an earthen base, it is evident that the flow has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=11899)|

| 3:20:30| I'd like to start by calling on engineering to just talk, if you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| address the water issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| I think you all looked into there weren't flood issues on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12036)|
| 3:20:41| I mean, this isn't in a floodway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12045)|
| 3:20:46| This isn't in a FEMA mapped floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| There's an 18-inch pipe at the intersection of Walker Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12050)|
| 3:20:55| at Meadcrest that drains onto the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| a 24-inch on the southeast corner, as the gentleman indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12058)|
| 3:21:03| and then a 30-inch pipe that crosses Walker Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| So there are three conveyances where stormwater does go onto the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12066)|
| 3:21:11| and it all exits the southeast corner, as the gentleman indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| Now, we know concept review happens after a concept is officially filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| which happens after zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| but have you all talked about what kind of mitigation issues will be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12081)|
| 3:21:25| for something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| Mr. Atkins, I'll invite you to come back up to talk as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12087)|
| 3:21:31| Yeah, and I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12091)|
| 3:21:32| Maybe my staff, maybe they have spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| I would like my folks to not maybe render opinions until we see actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| I think that may be a little premature, and I'm maybe sorry about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12100)|
| 3:21:44| but I'll speak to my folks because until we see a design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12104)|
| 3:21:47| I don't want to really speak to the merits of that engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| Every site can be engineered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| It just depends on the level of effort that the owner is willing to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| So, yeah, this site does have a lot of water flow on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| and my staff will be very diligent to make sure that our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| obviously anything that has more than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12126)|
| 3:22:11| has to have a stormwater management plan that complies with our stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12131)|

| 3:22:22| Mr. Atkins, you have two minutes left on your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| Did you want to address the stormwater issue or anything else that you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12148)|
| 3:22:29| Early on, I contacted David Poe from Batson Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| and so we've inspected the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12152)|
| 3:22:34| We went out to the site a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12154)|
| 3:22:37| especially most recently after a big rain, because we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| I mean, there's three conveyances that come on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| It runs to the most eastern part of the property down by Walker Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12162)|
| 3:22:46| Apartments and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12166)|
| 3:22:47| The problem with this property is it's never been improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| and so the only thing stopping the rainwater is just the natural flow across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12169)|
| 3:22:53| the ground to the property to the south of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| So we intend to build a retention pond on the southeast corner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| which is what it needs to slow that retainage down or have a retention area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| and then we also plan to do an impervious parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12183)|
| 3:23:06| so that will also capture the stormwater on the parking lot itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| We've got to do that, of course, in the engineering codes and guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| and submit that so it complies with Knox County's ordinances, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12192)|
| 3:23:15| and we're prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| That's plan one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| The lot's over an acre, so we always knew we had to do a retention basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12198)|
| 3:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Atkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12202)|
| 3:23:23| Mr. Beeler, you go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| Mr. Snowden, has that pipe underneath Meadcrest been inspected recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12207)|
| 3:23:36| I'm not aware of such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| I did speak to one of my folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| I think someone on my staff met with some folks today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12220)|
| 3:23:43| maybe some of the folks that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| He did indicate to me, he didn't necessarily talk about the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12225)|
| 3:23:48| but he did say that it may have some blockage in it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| just sediment and things, so we will do a service request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| and actually take our back truck out there and clean that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12234)|
| 3:23:57| to make sure that it's adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| That was my observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| There's a ditch that goes across the south of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| completely across Meadcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| and the last rain event, we went up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| During the rain, we took some pictures from up on the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| because it comes down toward this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| sort of bowls out and goes back to Walker Springs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| Probably 75% of this water diverts before there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| and comes to the property to the south of me by two lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12256)|
| 3:24:19| and there wasn't a whole lot coming across that ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| but on the south side of my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12261)|
| 3:24:22| there's a clearly defined drainage ditch, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12262)|
| 3:24:25| that's been made and goes to the back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| and that's in addition to what goes along the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12267)|
| 3:24:30| Commissioner Bussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12270)|
| 3:24:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12277)|
| 3:24:38| Mr. Akins, when you cleaned the property off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12278)|
| 3:24:44| and you found all this drainage that was going in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| the 18-inch pipe, the 30-inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| I can't hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| I said when you were going in and you were cleaning off the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| and you found all that drainage that you'd have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| and when you got your engineer with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| did he give you some sort of a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| how you could mitigate that water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12304)|
| 3:25:08| The detention basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| because there's just nothing there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| This property, if you look at it from the Walker Springs side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| it's a pretty substantial ditch, and then it flattens out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12313)|
| 3:25:16| The property flattens out and the ditch flattens out as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12316)|
| 3:25:18| So when you get to the south, it's just basically a flat surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| that dumps directly to the south, hits that ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| and it sort of comes over to the east, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| and there's a defined drainage ditch behind Walker Springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| back toward the park, toward Walker Springs Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| So we've got to stop that water on site before it comes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12331)|
| 3:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12334)|
| 3:25:35| So the water that's running through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| is causing a natural ditch by the water itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12337)|
| 3:25:42| or is it getting into these pipes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| Well, it comes out of those pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| It doesn't go into the pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12347)|
| 3:25:48| It all dumps into this site on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12348)|
| 3:25:50| There's one road, one part on the south of East Meadcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| and the other pipes are all to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12354)|
| 3:25:56| and they all go to the back of the property and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12356)|
| 3:25:58| So if you look at a map, the east side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| is where all the water comes down through that ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12360)|
| 3:26:02| and it's a pretty substantial ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12362)|
| 3:26:04| At the very top, it's probably 7, 8 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| When you get to the bottom, it's 2 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| It's really shallow at the end, so it flattens out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12368)|
| 3:26:10| and there's just nothing stopping it now from just going to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12370)|
| 3:26:13| There's nothing that slows it down other than natural vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12373)|
| 3:26:16| and vines and brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| So you've got your engineers working on the problem too, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12378)|
| 3:26:22| Oh, yeah, we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12382)|
| 3:26:23| It's over an acre, and the site needs a retention pond no matter what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| No matter what it is, no matter what it gets developed into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12387)|
| 3:26:30| it needs a retention pond just because there's nothing stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12390)|
| 3:26:33| And there's downstream flooding from here is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12393)|
| 3:26:36| about two houses down and then one past that especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12396)|
| 3:26:39| So it needs to be stopped upstream and at least slowed down tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12399)|
| 3:26:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| Mr. Snowden, did you get a chance to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12408)|
| 3:26:50| did your team get a chance to look at this property before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| or when it was on the MPC agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| We did, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12421)|
| 3:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12422)|
| 3:27:03| And Mr. Adkins, how many stories will these 16 units be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12423)|
| 3:27:10| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12430)|
| 3:27:11| They're all just the same two-story, 24-feet wide, 30-foot long house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12431)|
| 3:27:15| two-story houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| And then, Mr. Chairman, did you say you were familiar with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12437)|
| 3:27:24| or did you have some contact with the district commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| so we kind of get an idea of what he was feeling on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| I've spent a good amount of time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| and I've spent time with both the homeowners in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| and Mr. Adkins learning about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12457)|
| 3:27:42| So do we know how Commissioner Smith feels about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12462)|
| 3:27:47| We don't know how Commissioner Smith would vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| but Commissioner Smith has conveyed information to both the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12469)|
| 3:27:54| and to the, he's committed some opinions to both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12474)|
| 3:28:01| and the homeowners, and I'm aware of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12481)|
| 3:28:06| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12486)|
| 3:28:07| I'm happy to start it off with a motion if there's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| but I want to make sure everybody has a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| I'd like to make a motion on 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12494)|
| 3:28:17| We'll deal with density next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12497)|
| 3:28:21| but I'd like to make a motion to approve 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12501)|
| 3:28:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12511)|
| 3:28:32| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12512)|
| 3:28:34| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12514)|
| 3:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| There's one pass from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12516)|
| 3:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12519)|
| 3:28:40| So that would be 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12520)|
| 3:28:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12523)|
| 3:28:44| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12524)|
| 3:28:45| We'll move on to the next item and stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| We have to do the whole thing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12528)|
| 3:28:50| So, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12530)|
| 3:28:51| 4-K-21-RC is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12531)|

| 3:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| And the opposition is still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12562)|
| 3:29:24| I'll just recognize you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12564)|
| 3:29:26| Ms. Brooks, if you would give us a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12566)|
| 3:29:29| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| PR plan residential zoning up to 10 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12571)|
| 3:29:34| because it is compatible with the adjacent development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| the sector plan as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| and the growth policy plan by a vote of 7 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12581)|
| 3:29:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| I'm going to start off the conversation right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12584)|
| 3:29:46| and just start off with a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12586)|
| 3:29:48| I've spent a good amount of time on this and out on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12588)|
| 3:29:52| It is certainly, this is sort of a classic buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12592)|
| 3:29:55| where you've got high-density apartments on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12595)|
| 3:29:58| and you've got an older established neighborhood on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12598)|
| 3:30:01| and it's sort of stuck right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| I'm certain that given the history of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| they might have even developed this to be part of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| but we really, this is quite a sandwich in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12609)|
| 3:30:12| I think that the 10 dwelling units an acre is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| I think I know that some of the residents would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| maybe two or three or four units an acre on the low end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12619)|
| 3:30:22| and so as a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12622)|
| 3:30:24| I'd like to make a motion to approve 7.5 units an acre for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12624)|
| 3:30:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12630)|
| 3:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12632)|
| 3:30:33| This is the first by Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| second by Commissioner Ward at 7.5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12638)|
| 3:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12641)|
| 3:30:42| And Mr. Atkins, I'll give you a chance to speak as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| if any of the other opposition wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| Now is your shot to do that, but I'll call on Commissioner Daley first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12647)|
| 3:30:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| Amy, the 19.01 to the right of my screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12654)|
| 3:31:00| that looks like apartments, that's apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| What's the density there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12664)|
| 3:31:06| Commissioner Daley, I don't know off the top of my head exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12666)|
| 3:31:10| It's high density for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12670)|
| 3:31:12| I think it's about 20, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12672)|
| 3:31:14| It's pretty high density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12674)|
| 3:31:15| It looks like it's pretty spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12675)|
| 3:31:17| I'm not familiar with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| It's pretty much spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12679)|
| 3:31:20| They're not clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| It's a lot of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12682)|
| 3:31:23| I'm not sure how big the property is, but there's probably 16 to 20 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12683)|
| 3:31:27| It's a pretty massive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| Help me out on, and I apologize I didn't go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12689)|
| 3:31:33| Where at on Walker Springs is this located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| The best way to describe it is go behind Walmart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12696)|
| 3:31:39| go to Gallagher View Road and go north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| make a left on Walker Springs Road going back into Crestwood Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12701)|
| 3:31:44| That winds around and you'll see Walker Springs Apartments on your left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12704)|
| 3:31:47| This is the next parcel and Crestwood Hills is behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12707)|
| 3:31:50| That's where I thought it was, but I want to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| I agree with Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| 10 to me is way too high for the neighbors to the left of my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12715)|
| 3:32:03| And I would even support maybe something less than 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12723)|
| 3:32:10| I just wanted to see what that density was over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| Well, as a point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12733)|
| 3:32:14| the reason why I requested what I requested is not because I'm trying to go to 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| It's always been the development plan I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| I want to do 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12740)|
| 3:32:22| There's the centralized parking lot that's got the landscaping, the units around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12742)|
| 3:32:25| It's a long piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| It's relatively thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12747)|
| 3:32:28| So the idea is to not have 12 driveways or 10 driveways out because there's a gas line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12748)|
| 3:32:33| If you look on a map on the west side, there's Colonial Pipeline has a gas line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12753)|
| 3:32:38| and I don't want to cross that repetitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12758)|
| 3:32:40| And so the way it is now for meeting with the Colonial representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12760)|
| 3:32:43| their optimum scenario is to cross it as minimal as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12763)|
| 3:32:47| And the way to do that is it's a dome, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12767)|
| 3:32:50| They come on site while you're there with an excavator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12770)|
| 3:32:52| They put a dome over the pipeline, and you drive like a bridge, essentially, over the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12772)|
| 3:32:57| And so that would be one way in and one way out, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12777)|
| 3:33:00| That's the idea behind the driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12780)|
| 3:33:02| And the gas line is a big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| The sewer line is also across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12784)|
| 3:33:06| I'm able to get the sewer to the south with Walker Springs Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| Unbeknownst to me, when I approached them about trying to get an easement through their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| they've got a sewer problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12793)|
| 3:33:14| They've got a building down there that's right next to a tree that's grown up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12794)|
| 3:33:17| It's been 50 years, and now they've got a building that doesn't work correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12797)|
| 3:33:20| So with West Knox Utility District, they're in favor of me adding two manholes, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12800)|
| 3:33:25| up to my property and replacing part of the line that's theirs now from a 6- to an 8-inch line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12805)|
| 3:33:30| replace that, and let Walker Springs reconnect again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12810)|
| 3:33:33| So that was sort of the idea behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12813)|
| 3:33:35| The density issue, though, specifically was not to try to get 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12815)|
| 3:33:39| The way I looked at it is the way MPC counts units is they count it by doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12819)|
| 3:33:43| So I'm looking at 12 buildings, two-story, three-bedroom, two-bath units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12823)|
| 3:33:48| The only reason I wanted to go above that was if someone comes to me that's an older neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| and they say, I would like to have a master on the main plan because all I've got is bedrooms up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12832)|
| 3:33:57| They said, if I want a master on the main plan, I can't do that without going up in the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12837)|
| 3:34:01| because what I would do is then have a master unit down and I'd add a unit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12841)|
| 3:34:06| So instead of having three bedrooms, I would have a one-bedroom and a one-bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| but MPC counts that as two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12849)|
| 3:34:11| So what that would give me the ability to do is to take four of those units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12851)|
| 3:34:14| and make them one-bedroom plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12854)|
| 3:34:16| But the way MPC counts, it would be eight units that are ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| and then I would have four units that would be eight doubles because they're stacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12859)|
| 3:34:24| So it's less bedrooms but more units, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12864)|
| 3:34:27| So it has an unintended consequence to cut the density down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12867)|
| 3:34:30| It's still going to be the 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| That's what the plan has always been, and that's what I submitted to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| and I submitted to the county commission from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12875)|
| 3:34:38| It's a plan I've already drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12878)|
| 3:34:40| Our architecture already has the blueprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| Are you apartments or are these homes that you're going to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12882)|

| 3:34:49| When I did my office building, I did a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| I had five buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12892)|
| 3:34:54| I sold the first building, kept the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12894)|
| 3:34:56| What I'll do here is probably the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12896)|
| 3:34:58| I'll sell those units, keep part of those units, and eventually sell all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12898)|
| 3:35:01| But it gives the developer rights a lot more control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| because the way the master plan is written on my office is by retaining developer rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12903)|
| 3:35:08| I can control the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| I can get the landscaping up to maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12910)|
| 3:35:12| I can control the outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12912)|
| 3:35:13| I can control the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12913)|
| 3:35:14| I can control all those factors to get the property on its feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12914)|
| 3:35:17| before you turn it over to all the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| And you do that day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12919)|
| 3:35:20| It can be a mess because there's competing interest and nobody knows what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12920)|
| 3:35:24| and you're not stabilized with the reserve and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12924)|
| 3:35:27| And that property I built in 2005 and I still own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| There's 36 units and I still own, I think, 22 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| So I've sold a portion, kept a portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12933)|
| 3:35:36| Is that the one you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| Yes, sir, I drew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12938)|
| 3:35:39| That's not David Poe's plan, but that's a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12939)|
| 3:35:43| And it's important to know that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| There's a gas line easement there, so you can't extend out toward East Meadcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12945)|
| 3:35:49| And what I intend to do, basically, if you're looking at it from Meadcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12949)|
| 3:35:52| from the view of the homeowners, what you'll have is you'll have two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12952)|
| 3:35:55| an entrance and an exit, and then that will be screened in landscaping completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12955)|
| 3:35:59| And then you actually screen the parking lot to hide the villas behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12959)|
| 3:36:03| 7.5 would be 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12965)|
| 3:36:06| The 7.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| That would be the 12 buildings, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| That would be 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| That doesn't hurt me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12971)|
| 3:36:12| All that does for me is it limits me to be able to go down to a one-bedroom plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12972)|
| 3:36:16| I can still do the three-bedroom units and be totally happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12976)|
| 3:36:20| Would anybody from the opposition like to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12980)|
| 3:36:24| I didn't really time anybody, so I'll just wing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12984)|
| 3:36:29| And if you would, I know you already did it, but give us your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12989)|
| 3:36:33| Kevin Rail, 713 East Meadcrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12993)|
| 3:36:36| I would like to say that the parking lot that's going to be created is going to face the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=12996)|
| 3:36:42| If the parking lot were to face the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13002)|
| 3:36:46| then it would be more conducive to the homeowners, for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13006)|
| 3:36:52| and still remain more along the lines of what has been produced at the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13012)|
| 3:37:00| If we're comparing to the apartments, comparing to that style of living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| then this plan with the parking lot, the dumpster, and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13025)|
| 3:37:09| fits more along the lines of the apartments than it does homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13029)|
| 3:37:14| And facing the home street, there's no way to provide screening along there because of the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13034)|
| 3:37:21| You cannot provide screening in front of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13041)|
| 3:37:27| It would have to be behind the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13047)|
| 3:37:30| So all of those cars, that's the view of the homeowners, would be all of the cars right out in front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13050)|
| 3:37:35| all 32 or 24 cars that would be for each one of those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13055)|
| 3:37:42| I have a question for Mr. Atkins related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13062)|
| 3:37:45| Just so you know, Mr. Rayl, one of the harder things that we do is zoning comes before use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13065)|
| 3:37:52| and so everyone has to go back through another process and go through how would they use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13072)|
| 3:37:58| But contrary to what you said, you said there would be screening between the parking lot and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13078)|
| 3:38:04| Could you help explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13084)|
| 3:38:05| Because you can't plant on top of the pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13085)|
| 3:38:08| Does that mean you'll be leaving between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13088)|
| 3:38:10| If you look at the map, the way I've met with Colonial Pipeline, where the pipeline easement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13090)|
| 3:38:15| the parking lot's been shifted about 12 foot to the west for that very specific purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13095)|
| 3:38:19| I need an 8-foot buffer between their easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| They've got a construction guideline, which I have, which allows certain types of plants in the easement itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13101)|
| 3:38:26| So you can plant in the easement, but there's only, you know, small things, monkey grass, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13106)|
| 3:38:31| The second tier, if you will, away from that easement, you can plant trees, like Burford hollies, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13111)|
| 3:38:36| But they want their edge of those trees, whatever the canopy is, not to impede their easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13116)|
| 3:38:41| Like a Newland cypress or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| Yeah, they fly the gas on the helicopter and they want to look down at their gas line and make sure it's unimpeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13123)|
| 3:38:47| So I've got their construction specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| And then I'm meeting with, and I wrote the guy's name down, the landscape architect is Alan Duke from Land Design Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13129)|
| 3:38:56| is who I've contracted with, to specifically have enough room to put Burford hollies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13136)|
| 3:39:01| and other plants that grow up really tall between the gas line and between this parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13141)|
| 3:39:05| So, and the other reason, I didn't really speak about this, but houses, I'm in a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13145)|
| 3:39:10| The entrance for this property, the exit for this property is away from the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| If I try to go in there and build houses, which, while it's unfeasible, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13154)|
| 3:39:18| the driveways connect right at the corner of the intersection, which is not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13158)|
| 3:39:21| Huge thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13161)|
| 3:39:22| The other thing is if I take exactly what's across the street, which are 1970 designs, it's built in the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13162)|
| 3:39:28| it's financial suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13168)|
| 3:39:29| It doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13169)|
| 3:39:30| I can't go build a 2,000 square foot house at today's $250 a square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13170)|
| 3:39:35| I would be double to triple what the neighborhood would warrant just across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13175)|
| 3:39:39| So that's why this is a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| And these units, even though they're two-story units, I'm still at a 250 to 275 value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13181)|
| 3:39:46| and I'm still above the neighborhood, even getting the density like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13186)|
| 3:39:50| That's simply where I'm at with cost today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13190)|
| 3:39:52| But you're able to assure the residents that you will screen this as much as possible to put up a buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13192)|
| 3:39:58| Well, there's a landscape plan with Alan Duke that we've got to submit back from the use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13198)|
| 3:40:01| I specifically went for PR to go back on the use and review to work all these issues out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13201)|
| 3:40:06| Retention pond, drainage, screening, all those have got to be worked out with planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13206)|
| 3:40:11| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13215)|
| 3:40:16| It's very refreshing to have an applicant that actually has done their homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13216)|
| 3:40:22| and knows the answers to the questions, and I really appreciate that because I've been on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13222)|
| 3:40:28| body for a little over six years now, and I can probably count the people that have been as prepared as you all on one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13228)|
| 3:40:36| So I really wanted to compliment you and the way you handled this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| My inner dork came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13240)|
| 3:40:41| I collect data for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| That's what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13243)|
| 3:40:44| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| Mr. Aikens, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13248)|
| 3:40:52| You are asking for, what, 10 units per acre to build certain houses where you're going to cluster about 12 instead of 20, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13252)|
| 3:41:02| Well, there's 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| That won't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13264)|
| 3:41:05| There's still 12 buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13265)|
| 3:41:06| The only change would be if I take one building, instead of it being three bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13266)|
| 3:41:10| and make it a one-bedroom, one-bedroom, MPC counts that as two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13270)|
| 3:41:14| It doesn't change the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| It doesn't change the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| It just changes the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| It's counterintuitive because if I change to two one-bedrooms, the parking lot gets smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13279)|
| 3:41:24| It doesn't make sense, but that's the way it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| because I would have to go to higher density to get less units and less parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13286)|
| 3:41:33| So if we do it 7.5, you can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13293)|
| 3:41:36| I can't decrease it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13296)|
| 3:41:37| If you do 7.5, I'm going to have 12 three-bedroom units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13297)|
| 3:41:41| and the parking that I'm calculating is I want a parking space per bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13301)|
| 3:41:47| I don't want to go less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13307)|
| 3:41:48| So if I go to four of the units and go to one bedroom, I would lose four parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13308)|
| 3:41:53| and I would produce the parking space size accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| So that's the only difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| That's why I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13317)|
| 3:41:58| It just prevents me from going down in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| It keeps me at three bedrooms per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13321)|
| 3:42:05| It's a weird dynamic that that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13325)|
| 3:42:10| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13330)|
| 3:42:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| Mr. Atkins, is this what you're proposing in house design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13334)|
| 3:42:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13338)|
| 3:42:19| It's kind of hard without looking and seeing what you sent us, the vision, what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13339)|
| 3:42:25| But if you're talking about this, this looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| It's a Charleston plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| That's a Chattanooga picture I took myself, one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13350)|
| 3:42:32| The far left picture is actually a concept drawing from a blueprint I found online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13352)|
| 3:42:37| that's very similar to what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13357)|
| 3:42:39| It looks the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13359)|
| 3:42:42| I liked it because the concept is you have what's called houses in the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13362)|
| 3:42:45| If you're a resident there, you basically look out the front and you've got screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13365)|
| 3:42:49| and you look out the back behind Walker Springs Apartments, you've got screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13369)|
| 3:42:52| You shouldn't be able to see anything outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13372)|
| 3:42:54| And you have boardwalks through the property, so you don't have parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13374)|
| 3:42:57| It's not a parking jungle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13377)|
| 3:42:58| You don't want 12 or 10 driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13378)|
| 3:43:00| You've got the tightest possible space for parking, and the rest is returned to woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13380)|
| 3:43:05| You don't even mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13385)|
| 3:43:06| You leave it all natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13386)|
| 3:43:07| You plant it back completely with vines and ivy and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13387)|
| 3:43:10| That's the aesthetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13390)|
| 3:43:11| And that design doesn't come from that originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13391)|
| 3:43:14| We have another piece of property on Dubusque Lane that's got oak trees that are as big as that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| They're massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13398)|
| 3:43:19| They're 150 foot high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13399)|
| 3:43:21| And so we originally looked at how to pioneer sort of a development with the density to get as much open space as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13401)|
| 3:43:29| And that's the best way to do it is to make your parking lot as small as possible and then screen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13409)|
| 3:43:33| So impervious pavers, nothing but no blacktop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13413)|
| 3:43:36| Just try to make it so it blends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13416)|
| 3:43:38| It's more of a high-end kind of a feel even though it's a small product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13418)|
| 3:43:43| If you've ever been to pot hotels in New York, it's very similar to luxurious but small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13423)|
| 3:43:48| That's the idea behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13428)|
| 3:43:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Seeing no further lights on, there's a proper motion before us and a second for 7.5 units an acre on item number 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13432)|
| 3:44:03| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13445)|
| 3:44:06| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13446)|
| 3:44:07| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210524-combined?start=13447)|
