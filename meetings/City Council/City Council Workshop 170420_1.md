| 1:35:15| You know, we've also had a conversation with Weston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I mean, they'd love to come in here and take a shot at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| So I think from the way Ferris has got this design, we've got the ultimate flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| because the parking garage is set up to where it can handle, it will handle whatever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| footprint and height of the building needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| That'll just be engineered into the parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| And then we don't want to look at the parking deck, so we've got it where the parking deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| is wrapped, if you will, to where we're not looking at parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| So it doesn't really matter, you know, how wide or how deep or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| That will let the brand and the actual programming dictate what that needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| But, you know, I've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| But really what's happening, and I think, Bill, you alluded to this, is that during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| the development agreement, a lot of these kinds of things will be worked out, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| will most likely be with another council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| You've signed that agreement Tuesday night, we'll go to work Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Dwayne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Yeah, quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Rick, I don't have to ask this, I'll just go ahead and ask it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| You've got a half-dozen projects going in Knoxville, the South Knoxville Young High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| School, you know, the garage building, the old high school on 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| Are you at some point overextended for what Rick Dover can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I don't know, the banks keep calling me and pushing money at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| I've been trying to push back from the table a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| We right now have two active projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| So we have Knoxville High and the Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| That's all we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| The Prior Brown garage and South High are in design, and they will likely start next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| So, you know, I'm trying to find my dominoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| So they're phased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| You're saying they're phased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| So we'll finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| We finished North Shore earlier this year, at the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| We finished Oakwood and Alexander in 2015, in the fourth quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| We'll finish Knoxville High and the Farragut Hotel makeover this fall, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| start Prior Brown and South High late this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| We'll finish those in 2018, and then I'm out of a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| We'll find another block for you, don't worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| I think this is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| Ferris, did you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| The only last thing is, what you see up there is the unrendered version of the model, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| Kristen is just going to do a little walk around, just so that to give you a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| feel of the overall mix on how this is put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| And obviously, keep in mind, this is unrendered, just the raw model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5867)|
| 1:37:54| Tell us what streets you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| So this is Church Avenue here, and then you get into the corner with Locust being the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| residential entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| And here you see the landscape islands that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| And then coming up here to the left would be the Supreme Court building, and how we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| proposing to reuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| You can see in the middle, that entrance to the garage, that that's the only portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| that you do see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| And you can see here in this 3D, again, none of the garage on the inside is seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| That's very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| And here you're on Cumberland Avenue, coming down to the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| And this is your lower residential entrance at the lower corner, at Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| And then when you get on Henley, you start to see back at the hotel components and elevated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| level of the terrace, which would be the conference room facility level, and then back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5932)|
| 1:39:01| corner of the hotel, and the main entrance at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| So this corner is essentially caddy corner from the entrance to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| So there's no bridge or anything over to the convention center at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Is there a zip line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| If you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| Our thought is, our preference, is to have people on the street, pedestrians on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5969)|
| 1:39:34| street, on the sidewalks, rather than bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| We understand it's Henley Street, we understand it has a lot of traffic on it, but I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| believe that the state, between the state and the city, some things can happen to slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| down traffic on Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| And those are all issues kind of beyond what I can do on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| But we do understand that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Yeah, Rick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| May I add one little thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| I didn't mean to come off flippant about Mr. Della Volpe's financial question, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| very real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| One of the things that I want to point out, and this has kind of been a perception thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| this proposal that is in front of you is a straight 50-50 joint venture, pair of pursuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| across the board for the entire project with Bristol Development Group out of Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| Charles's company and I would be, my company would be 50-50 partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| So that gives you more capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Oh boy does it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| They are the preeminent multifamily urban developer in all these markets that he alluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| to from Louisville to Birmingham to Richmond to Chattanooga to Jacksonville, Huntsville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| Nashville, all these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| We could not have found a better partner for expertise, integrity, and financial strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| So we're very, very proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Charles is too modest to bring that up, but I'll bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| So, and I'm also happy to sit down when we get into the development agreement phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| hopefully we'll be in that phase, I'll be happy to sit down with the city financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| department and open my books to them and be happy to bring in a financial statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| I don't really want to see it in New Sentinel the next day, but I'll be happy to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| My question really was, at some point are you biting off more than you can chew as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| That was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Well, this is the business I'm in, so, you know, and we pass on projects all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| but when something comes along that's got a historical preservation component to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| and it's in downtown Knoxville, and it's something I recognize as being a fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| opportunity for all of us, really, not just me or my family, this is for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Then, you know, I want to get in there and see what I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| And I think with my level of experience and my commitment to the community, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| work openly with y'all and make this place the best that it possibly can be, every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| That's why, you know, I don't want to go out and put the restaurant component of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| you know, just out on the street and take a lease on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| I'd rather have it with Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| He wants to eventually own that building, and we couldn't have a better partner for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| multifamily or operating side than Bristol, and Bristol's willing to make the same financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| commitment that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| You know, if you read in the paper, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| It's Dover this, Dover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| It's not Dover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| This is Supreme Court partners, 50-50, Bristol Court and Dover Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6128)|
| 1:42:13| So, I just, I mean, I'm flattered that, you know, my name goes first, but it really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| This is 50-50, straight across the board, and it'll be that way for every single part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| of this project for as long as we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Any other questions to Rick or to Charlie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Just to reiterate what Rick said, it is a 50-50 partnership, and we're in this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| and we're very serious about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| I mean, I know some of you are in the real estate-related businesses, and you know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| expensive it is to get involved in an undertaking like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| And so, of the 34 properties I mentioned a minute ago, and all the ones we have in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| pipeline, if we're able to get through this development agreement and through this initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| phase of design successfully together, we have never in our history failed to ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6185)|
| 1:43:13| close and build and successfully lease and have a successful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6193)|
| 1:43:22| Sometimes it's taken us longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| In the downturn that happened after 2008-9, we had some properties we just had to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| the land long enough for the banks to come back and be willing to lend again, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| never wavered in our determination to get those to the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| Do you design, build, and sell, or do you operate, you keep operating them once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| build them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| We don't, maybe more information than you want, but we're purely and simply a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6226)|
| 1:43:55| company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| We aren't designers, and we aren't contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| That's why we have people like Ferris and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| When it's up and finished, do you run it or sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| We also are not managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| We go into whatever market we're in and find the best-in-class property management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| We get very heavily involved in the initial lease-up, because that's something that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| property management companies don't do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| And then we usually are looking to hold a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6260)|
| 1:44:26| Sometimes we have financial partners who may have different interests, so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6266)|
| 1:44:32| always hold the things that we build, but we have several with partners who have wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| to hold for long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| I had a comment, and I think we're doing a lot downtown, but one of the things we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| to think about as a city is a great lack of diversity downtown, in terms of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| living downtown, as well as business ownership downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| And I think the city needs to look at that and see where we're headed, because it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| a good thing for the city to be so non-diverse, let me put it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| And I don't know how to solve that, but I think we need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| And I'm supporting all of these great things that are happening downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| It's good for the city, but the face of the city, especially downtown, and I represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| downtown, and it's going to have an effect politically on this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| So all of that needs to be thought about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| I just want to throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Rick, we want to thank you and your team for coming this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| And this was one of the things that we really wanted to do, instead of taking up a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| time, and so we really appreciate you doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| We also appreciate Dr. Lyons and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| And Dr. Lyons, you want to just quickly say what the next steps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| Yes, thank you very much, and thank you for your interest and your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Appreciate that very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| The next step, of course, is the vote on the purchase and sale agreement, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| on the agenda for the next council meeting, 25th, Tuesday, 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| As Mr. Dover said, we're ready to get immediately into the development agreement, and we hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| to get that done sooner than later, and hope to get it done in time for you to see it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| Anything else from council on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Dinner, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Rick, again, and Dr. Lyons, thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| We appreciate it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshop170420?start=6401)|
