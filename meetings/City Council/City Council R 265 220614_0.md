| 0:03:44| five votes to approve items on the agenda, even though there are just six of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| It's not a majority of the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=229)|

| 0:03:53| Moving on to the mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| First, we have a new member of the cabinet joining us this evening, Chief Paul Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| He was sworn in yesterday as our new police chief, and he's already hit the ground running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=241)|

| 0:04:10| Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| This program prepares officers to successfully intervene to prevent harm and to create a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| law enforcement culture that supports peer intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=256)|

| 0:04:28| Next, I want to publicly recognize Pride Month and all of the inclusive and welcoming activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=268)|
| 0:04:39| in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Just last week, the city lit the pedestrian bridge in rainbow colors in support of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| LGBTQ community, and Knox Pride has a month full of events underway right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=284)|

| 0:04:55| through October 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| This move will hopefully mean cooler weather and allow for multiple days of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| So thank you again, Knox Pride, for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| Later this week, we have another thing to celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| I want to invite Council out to a ribbon-cutting for Knoxville Fire Department Station No. 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| in the East Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| These half-million-dollar renovations are now complete, and the ribbon-cutting will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=313)|

| 0:05:47| from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=347)|

| 0:06:13| to the Greenway, which now connects the park to Western Avenue, which is, I think, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| to be useful not just for people to enjoy the park, but also for people who need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| walk to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=382)|

| 0:07:47| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I just wanted to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I wanted to share with my colleagues and also with the public that following our discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| during the budgeting process, I inquired about a charter review process to potentially look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=479)|
| 0:08:09| into changes we could make to our budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| I have received that information from City Council Attorney Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| And it's a process that we would not be able to carry out this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Sorry, this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| And so I have a few proposals that I think are pretty straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| And so I have posted those to the City Council web forum and invite my colleagues and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| public to review them, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| I don't think anyone but Council can make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| But they will be on the agenda in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| So I just wanted to give you all a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| In regard to sidewalks, I had a constituent to make a suggestion, which I promised to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| share with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| And it was simply his concern for the existing sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Sometimes they have debris on them, and it's difficult for elderly people or people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| are physically challenged sometimes to walk in just because of the debris, even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| there's sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| And he suggested that all of our good neighbors in the city take a little care to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| the sidewalk in front of their house and simply clean it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And that also grass in the street from mowing can sometimes be a deterrent to, a hazard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| to motorcyclists and bicyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| So he just wanted to make that suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=580)|
| 0:09:43| It doesn't cost an expenditure of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| It doesn't cost any time for the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| It's just being good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| So I wanted to share that with you on behalf of one of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=598)|

| 0:13:17| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| I just wanted to thank a few individuals and organizations that have documented the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=800)|
| 0:13:30| of the movement for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender civil rights in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| And this resolution would not have been able to be written without their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| And I'll start with Scott Parker from the Compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| I definitely pulled language that you have pulled together on this history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Jack Neely from the Knoxville History Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=832)|

| 0:13:58| Of course, Knox Pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| And the city of Knoxville has a web page that documents what the city has done on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=841)|
| 0:14:10| So without the work that you all have done, this resolution would not have been possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=850)|
| 0:14:17| Part of what this resolution recognizes is that as members of this community fight to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| live their authentic lives, that means many have lived their lives in private, not public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=864)|
| 0:14:35| lives, and a lot of those instances of discrimination and harassment have gone unreported and undocumented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=875)|
| 0:14:46| So it's a long resolution, but for me it was important to put as much information in here as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| because it's a community that does not have a lot of their history documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| If we have anyone here...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=898)|

| 0:15:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| I wanted to thank Council Member Parker for bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| I do think that it's important to recognize the history, and then also that June is LGBT Pride Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=918)|
| 0:15:26| and we all just recently saw on the news where there was a pride parade that was scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| and someone called in a tip that there were 30-plus people who loaded into a U-Haul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| and was planning to go to that parade and attack potentially the people and children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| that were participating in that parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| So these issues are real and they're relevant, and so I am pleased to be able to co-sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| onto this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| So thank you for bringing it to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I'm going to start in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Thank you for bringing this to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| At a time when at our state level all we hear is concern about people's private lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=965)|
| 0:16:14| and making children and anybody else who falls within the queer spectrum uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| and not feel worthy, this was a good time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| The least we can do as Knoxvillians is say that we respect all of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| whatever choices that they make within their sexuality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=996)|

| 0:17:31| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| When we had our council retreat, I can't even remember when it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| We had to reschedule so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| And we surveyed all the council members as to what we considered some of the biggest problems in Knoxville were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| We all kept going back to mental health and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| And that we knew if Medicaid expansion was allowed by Tennessee State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| we would be able to address some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| And Councilman Roberto put a lot of effort and energy into gathering together the city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1084)|
| 0:18:14| the nonprofit groups that work on this issue, and a couple of state people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1094)|
| 0:18:22| And I asked the question of a few of the nonprofit agencies that were here, including McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1102)|
| 0:18:30| about if there was Medicaid expansion, would they be able to serve more people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| And their response was, they got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| They're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| I'm not voting yes on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Mr. Wagner, or maybe someone from McNabb, I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1130)|
| 0:19:00| And I'm going to approach Councilwoman Singh's question differently, not to revisit that topic, but it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1140)|
| 0:19:08| I'm very much in favor of Medicaid expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| So we did cover that, two people that night, before I get to the meat of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| Let's let him state who he is for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| Jerry Wagner, CEO of the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| So, Mr. Wagner, how many people do you see a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| How many millions of dollars of care do you provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| We see approximately 40,000 people, individuals, a year in the East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| And our annual budget is about $85 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| How much charity care do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| How much do you have to write off each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| We're writing off upwards of $8 million of charity care in any given year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| And that's just work that needs to be done as a nonprofit we choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| And I would just interject that if you had Medicaid expansion, if more people had TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| some of that $8 million would be addressed that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| I just wanted to sunshine that as a response to the question that Councilwoman Singh asked at that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| And I failed to ask that of the providers that were there that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| and I will sunshine the fact that I'm married to a practitioner who said that's how you should ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| I'm just throwing that out there to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Now I'm going to turn my attention to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| You guys are going to be providing all types of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Is this an urgent center that's going to address all walk-up needs, or is it just behavioral health care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Tell us a little bit about what you're going to be doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| On this site, the concept and the design is having a true urgent care center at that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| so that community would have access to physical health, urgent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| And the concept we're working under is under the umbrella of the University of Tennessee Medical Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| in collaboration with Team Health would be providing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| That's their area of expertise to provide that type of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| We also believe that they will then screen people who have behavioral health issues through that front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| And then the McNabb Center's function will be to treat those people who have behavioral health conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| who come through that front door to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| And we'll treat people who would ordinarily go to an emergency room in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| And if you're not aware, you're talking about 8,500 people who've hit the emergency rooms in our local hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| just in Knox County last year who have a behavioral health condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| When they get there, unfortunately, they're unprepared clinically to deal with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| who have mental health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| And they kind of languish, if you will, in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| So we're going to create a healing environment for those patients that come to and be treated on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| There's no delay in care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| We'll have full medical staff, 24 hours available for their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| So how will the length of care and the care provided there be different than what's available at the BHUC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| I know the BHUC is not a walk-in center, but tell me how that differs, the length of care and what's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| It's a great point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| So at our urgent care facility off Western Avenue, it is a true diversion facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| The only people who come there are people who are brought by law enforcement in a diversion effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| so they do not go to our local jails and they get treatment in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| And that's typically a 24-hour stay, and then we follow them out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| and divert them from ever hitting the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| So that's the concept of the urgent care center off Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| This psychiatric facility that we're talking about will treat people as few as a few hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| if that's all they need, but we can keep them for days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So a multiple-day stay at this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| If you're unaware, what happens now if you're an emergency department in a local hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| and they determine that you're so sick because of your mental health disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| that you have to have your rights removed temporarily so you go to a psychiatric hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| they will retain you until such hospital is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| We will provide a similar function there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| The only difference being we will have active treatment going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| and if you're in an emergency room you're literally in a room without any intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| You're just waiting on a bed for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Ms. Ryder, I would just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| Just to clarify that to go to the BHUC you have to have committed a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| So one is jail diversion and one is emergency room diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| And someone even who's having a family or a loved one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| who's experiencing some kind of mental health crisis committed no crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| they can go to this one once it's built and operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| No, I didn't want to compare it in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| I wanted to compare it in what the treatment end of it was that you were getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| not how you arrived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| I'm very aware that the arrival there is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| I just wanted to know so people understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| How many beds do you anticipate having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| That will be my last question for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| So at this facility we think we will have upwards of 16 beds at that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And we'll also have some other evaluation areas and that type of thing for some extended capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Then I am on that note going to ask a question that you may not know the answer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Do you know how many beds are in the emergency room psych unit at UT Med Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| I don't know for a fact, but I think there are 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| I knew it was small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I think it's 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| So you're going to be slightly larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| So who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| And then back to the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| I'll get you next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| And so to understand this agreement, I see the work expected of the McNabb Center to renovate the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1500)|
| 0:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| And then a portion of the building would be sublet to a medical urgent care facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| And so the behavioral health urgent care center would be run by the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| That's just one thing I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| I think Council Member McKenzie was next and then Singh or Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| Mr. Bagner, I think McNabb does some very good work and I do support what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1534)|
| 0:25:39| My disappointment right now is that I felt we created a situation where we had the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| a chance to speak up to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| We were trying to advocate and very, very disappointed that we lost that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| Just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| I'm glad that I was last because I'm going to speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| While that workshop was very helpful and insightful, it was also because we're in a political climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| that is very polarizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| So I really felt bad for the agencies who were here because they were literally between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| a rock and a hard place to, in my opinion, when the people holding your purse strings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| are sitting there looking at you and listening to everything that you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| And so because of that, I'm a person that says we have to stand for the greater good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And the greater good are the people who need the services regardless of those who sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| positions of power who don't see the greater good, which is very disappointing, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| because Medicaid expansion absolutely could make an incredible difference and impact in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| the number of people that all of these agencies could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| So because of that, the greater good, I will be supporting it, and I would hope that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| will all continue to advocate and those who are watching, those in the audience, to lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| your state legislators and the governor to accept Medicaid expansion because it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| travesty that we do not accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Well, I just wanted to say one more thing since I didn't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| I want to say, Mr. Vagner, and to the city and, I guess, to the county and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| because they're providing some of the funding for this, I'm very much in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Technically, it is in Councilman Thomas' district, but it ties us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| And our community, as well as the East Knoxville community, was really kicked in the gut when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| we lost St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| My husband was a physician, a part of the St. Mary's network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| When they built the North Hospital and left that part of town, I was not on council at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I worked with neighborhood groups and KICMA, which is the minister's organizations, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| churches in East Knoxville and Lonsdale and, yeah, across the city because there's a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| part of our population just does not get enough health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| And so, you know, we need every bit of health care we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| We need more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| We need more funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| It's one of the greatest needs we have in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| And East Tennessee is lacking in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| So I'm excited to have you guys there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| If it is only 16 beds, but we need care back in our area and we need people to be seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| And the earlier that they're seen and the more access they have to health care, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| more preventative care we have and the less money that the state and the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| and local charities end up spending on long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Stage four, stage three cancers are, you know, further gone cardiac problems, further gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| diabetes, all of the issues that are being missed and not treated because people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| have access to primary care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| So I know that's not you guys' primary goal there, but we need it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| And we've been lacking for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| So I welcome you guys and I hope my colleagues will support adding this to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| And maybe we'll see it expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I want to thank my colleagues for very well expressing some of my sentiments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| And I very briefly will say I share their disappointment in the state of Medicaid, Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| expansion, Medicaid expansion through the Affordable Care Act here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| And I think a lot of our agencies would be benefiting greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| And most importantly, our citizens in need would be benefiting greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| And I've been very disappointed, quite frankly, in our state for not expanding Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| And having said that, though, I've really appreciated the relationship that Ellen Rossman has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| You have more than one facility in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| You've always been a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| You maintain your facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| You serve the needs of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| This is particularly a great amenity for us because it was, as Councilperson Ryder said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1805)|
| 0:30:14| it was a real tough thing for our community to lose the St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| This will fill at least part of that and probably at least the most important when you're getting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1820)|
| 0:30:27| emergencies and acute care, the addressing the mental health issues that are just extremely important in our entire society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1827)|
| 0:30:40| So thank you for being a good partner, and I look forward, if this passes, to continuing working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| And I appreciate all the good work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| I just want to say that I applaud your efforts to innovate and fill in gaps in the mental illness kind of ecosystem we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1854)|
| 0:31:03| I think our city does a good job of recognizing gaps where either our housing or our mental health kind of ecosystem is insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1863)|
| 0:31:14| Permanent supportive housing filled a gap some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| We still fill that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| We needed a low barrier shelter, and an agency stepped in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| Last month I joined you at East Tennessee Children's Hospital to celebrate the Crisis Stabilization Unit for Kids, which will serve a similar role to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1883)|
| 0:31:33| And I think I just applaud our community, which is this body, our population of the city, agencies stepping up to fill gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1893)|
| 0:31:43| And so this is a gap that is left to us for a number of reasons, but we're not afraid to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| So thank you for being innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| I applaud the administration for your willingness to collaborate with the county as well, and I wish you the best success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Once the renovations are complete, what funding is available for the continued operations of this facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| For the operations, as I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| So this will have multiple legs of funding, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| So there will be a number of people who are uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| We've talked about it for the folks whose district it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So we're asking the state of Tennessee to step up and provide funding for people who have no insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Medicaid or TennCare will be billed for these services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| We've engaged with the TennCare division of the state, and they signed off on the concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| so we have to now negotiate with managed care companies, but we have TennCare's blessing, which is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| And part of our request to the governor was to have three-year pilot funding to underwrite the losses, if you will, as any startup will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| And so we've got three years of subsidy to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| So we think all of that together will be a tremendous help, and then the local hospitals are also putting funds into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| because they see the benefit for their patients to have good access to psychiatric care as opposed to what they're experiencing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| And I applaud them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| I mean, to have all three hospital systems in our community come together and say this is the solution that makes the most sense for our patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Council, I'll just remind you all a little bit about the history of how this came to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| You know, we went to Nashville with Jerry Wagner and the three hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| and David Brace and I and Chris Caldwell, the finance director, and Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| The head of TennCare was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Commissioner Williams, the head of State Department of Mental Health, was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| And we said, here we have a solution to fill a gap, and we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| And we need your help with the coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| We need your help with the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| The hospital stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| The county stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| So many times people ask city council members and me, how are you going to fix this issue, this mental health issue, this social service issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2045)|
| 0:34:13| And we have to say, well, we have to work with our partners in the public and private sector whose job it is to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| And that's exactly what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| We used our ability as conveners and coordinators to find a way to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| And I would just submit to you that politics is the art of the possible, and the vote before you right now is not whether to expand Medicaid or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2067)|
| 0:34:36| We all think that should happen, at least everyone in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| It's not whether to expand Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| It's whether to transform this property that belongs to the city of Knoxville to a medical and mental health facility for the people of this community or do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2082)|
| 0:34:54| That's the choice before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And I would encourage you, Council Member Singh, if you're considering to vote against it, to listen to the message of the sermon at our church this Sunday where the message was progress, not perfection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2095)|
| 0:35:07| I think that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| This isn't perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| It's not going to solve the mental health challenges of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| I plan on abstaining on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| And the reason is I'm not feeling like McNabb stood up for the people that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| This is progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| You were just ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| One abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for and accept a grant in the amount of $1,500,000 with no required local match from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Justice Programs to support community-based violence intervention and prevention initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2142)|

| 0:36:01| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| We have 11D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| We have one person signed up to speak in opposition, Constance Everey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| Please come to the podium, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2175)|
| 0:36:27| My name is Constance Everey, 301 North Charlotte Drive, Nassau, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| I want to correct that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| It's not necessarily oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| It's to raise concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| We have $1.5 million that is once again supposed to be coming directly towards particularly the African-American, brown and poor people community because that's where the violence is actually occurring and happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2198)|
| 0:36:49| However, the biggest concern we have is how are we going to spend this money to address the core issues and core aspects of violence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2209)|
| 0:37:00| It is poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| We have went from 43 to 47% increase to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| We have 60% of the homeless community that are made up of people who cannot afford their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| And yet we have an opportunity to bring funding in to really do something about that, and I see once again we're moving towards the typical cycle of surface and reaction addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2234)|
| 0:37:28| What is the concern around this is why, number one, we had to create a new role for LaKenya where she could have done this through PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2248)|
| 0:37:37| Or more importantly, the equity task force that has been assigned with the agenda of coming up with $100 million over the next 10 years, and this is the first year and we're nowhere near $10 million to stay on track for that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2257)|
| 0:37:50| How do we have to create the wheel over and over again while the car remains PARC and make no progress towards equity and justice for moving progressively in that direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2270)|
| 0:38:00| This comes off as what it looks like, a political stunt, so that later on when it's time to collect the black and brown and poor vote, we can wave our flags and say, look what we did for the Negroes once again of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2280)|
| 0:38:14| If we talk about violence interruption, then why are we not approaching it from a wraparound care approach with our police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| You have brought in a new police chief that is from the New Orleans Police Department, which is known to be one of the most corrupted police departments in America, to the point they had a prime time evening show just to highlight the corruption of New Orleans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2300)|
| 0:38:33| They're primed for this program called ABLE, and the Urban League and NAACP wrote approval letters for them to participate in this program, yet we have had no address to Anthony Thompson Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| We've had no address to the cops who are jumping on eighth graders over supposed marijuana odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| We have no address to the cop who was doing NASCAR and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| We've had no address to the cop who has lied under oath, multiple cops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| We have no address to the reports of employees actually reporting racism that is occurring in the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| What are we doing when we talk about violence interruption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| It's not just the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| It's not just poor legislation of gun policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| It is all aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| It is poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| It is homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| It is lack of affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| It is our police departments participate in brutality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| It is recreating the bill over and over time again with new position and titles, yet no real address or no impact to the actual core issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| When are we going to get serious about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| And this is only something you're going to throw back in our face later the next time Randy Boyd or Clayton or Haslam is here standing here for an initiative so you can say, once again, we've got to listen to Tommy Smith talk about how much has been done for the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2368)|
| 0:39:41| Janet Testman, she's not here tonight, but she's known for doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| Lauren Ryder, you participated in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| And, of course, Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| So what are we really getting here for the issues in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| What about our black boys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| What about our black girls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| What about our black women?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| What about all black men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| We got too many families in pain out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| And all I do is watch you all profit over and over again from the pain, but you do nothing for the core issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| This is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| This is poor leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| What should you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Use the power of your pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| That's what we voted you here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| That's why I'm running for office myself, because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I don't think I can do it better than you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| I absolutely believe that wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| And more importantly, I will finally have the access, the attainability of the power of the pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2425)|

| 0:40:27| I don't want to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I just want to access it, so I can give it to all of us, so we can all have a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| We don't need LBGQ policies under Constance Everett Direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| We don't have to worry about homelessness, menopaulity under Constance Everett Direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| What's this Republican, Democrat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Nothing, because Endicott Canyon was torturing, terrorizing homelessness before the state Republican legislator gave it the power to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| We have to get serious beyond this aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| It's not jokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| It's not games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| It's not funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| People are literally dying, and you all have done nothing with your positions other than clown around, put on performances, and pretend to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| In reality, our people are continuing to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Council, that concludes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| People have signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Any questions or comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| There's a lot of what Constance Avery said that is very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| I do respect that we are moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| I also remember that it was, what, 2018 when SEAD went out into the community and did surveys on what were the most pressing issues at the time, and it was gun violence that was at the top of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2491)|
| 0:41:46| That was 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| This is 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I know that last year I had a resolution where I wanted to attach $4 million to it, which I did not do because I didn't think that I would have the votes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| To me, this $1 million grant is moving in that direction, so that makes me happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| And then also the next item that we're going to vote on, to me, is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2534)|
| 0:42:25| I think there's a lot to be said right now, and not enough time to say it, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2545)|
| 0:42:36| I heard no lies in what Constance Avery said, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| We just had an update on the Crime Stoppers program before the city council meeting started, and that was a tense environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| Because, in my opinion, what we see happening are investments being made using the black community as the reason to make the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2571)|
| 0:43:08| But then when we look at the outcomes, the black community is not who is being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| They may be targeted, but they're not being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| And this continues to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| And so I have concerns with this grant as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I actually, once again, looked at the grant announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| I looked at the federal rules to determine what this grant could be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| Because once we even started the violence interruption work, the first investment was Crime Stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| That's not community-based violence prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| And based on the update I heard this morning, it could do a lot of harm to our communities that will end up not stopping the violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2627)|
| 0:43:57| It will put a lot of people in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| We'll have the war on drugs again in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| But the violence will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| The killing will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| So I'm hopeful that we will actually invest 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I'm hopeful that we will get this grant and that we will actually invest 1.5 million into community-based programs that can address the root causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2652)|
| 0:44:24| I hope that we will ignore much of the advice offered by Thomas Apt in Bleeding Out, who says ignore the root causes when investing money in violence intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2664)|
| 0:44:38| So your concerns are valid, Constance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| We have to stay on top of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| I'm in support of us pursuing this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| But I have concerns, and I'll be watching closely to make sure that if this money does come into the city, that it is directed into the right places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Just to clarify, Thomas Apt doesn't say to ignore root causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| It's just root causes are something we address through things like affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| I'm sorry, but, Mayor, that was my interpretation of my reading of his book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| Well, I've also read the book, and that's my interpretation, which I'm sharing to clarify for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| Ms. Middlebrook, I just wanted to ask you to share any insight on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Just a reminder to Council, we haven't received the grant yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| This is just authorizing my administration to apply for the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And, Ms. Middlebrook, if you could add any further clarification to help Council understand what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| And I did want to also clarify, as the Mayor stated, just so that everyone is clear, that this is not money that has been awarded to the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| This is money of up to $1.5 million in a competitive federal process that we will be applying for in hopes of bringing those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2750)|
| 0:45:59| So I do not want anyone to leave with the understanding this is money that the City of Knoxville has already been awarded and that will definitely be coming to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| But we remain hopeful that we will receive one of these awards and can greater use these resources to further violence reduction strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2766)|
| 0:46:17| proven violence reduction strategies that do take holistic approaches where they include supporting community-based organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| addressing some of the root causes involving our law enforcement community, and other systems-level stakeholders to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| As with any grant-making process, and especially our federal grants, there are specific requirements as to what the resources can be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2794)|
| 0:46:44| And there's really especially some specific indications around doing the work to continue to build out a comprehensive violence reduction strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2804)|
| 0:46:56| and then implementation of that work, which could involve some of the strategies that we are already proposing, as well as additional resources and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2816)|
| 0:47:06| But I do want to make it very clear that this is something that we are applying for with hopes of being rewarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| There is not already $1.5 million allocated to the City of Knoxville for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| And I don't want anyone to leave here with that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Thank you, Ms. Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Council Member Ryder and then McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Ms. Middlebrook, I don't want to get into the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| I will save that for when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| But I just wanted to clarify with you, when you and I discussed this agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2852)|
| 0:47:39| one of the things you stated to me is that the next agenda item is the work that we're starting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| and using city budget money to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| And hopefully, additionally, we get that additional $1.5 million that we can do additional on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Okay. Just wanted to clarify that. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you. Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Mayor, I think I need to save my comments for the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Okay. Any further questions or comments for item D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Seed Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| to incubate and oversee the implementation of violence interruption street outreach programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| for the city of Knoxville in an amount not to exceed $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2911)|

| 0:48:33| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Council members, we have several people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| First person signed up is Mr. Denzel Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Mr. Grant, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| My name is Denzel Grant, 3429 Lansing Avenue, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Before I get started, I think one of the things I wanted to do was I had a few people come and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| because I want you guys to see the people that's actually doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I just don't want to be a voice, so if y'all don't mind standing up for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| These are the faces that's actually going to be doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| What we came to talk about here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Like I said, I wanted you guys to take a look at these faces to get familiar with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| Because like we did speak on, a number of people spoke on the previous topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| I feel like the only way for this work to be effective is if we all play our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| This isn't something that only the community can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| This isn't something that only law enforcement can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| This isn't something that only city council can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| And so in our planning, we came up with a mission statement for our violence prevention program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2984)|
| 0:49:53| And what that is, is Turn Up Knox strives to interrupt cycles of gun violence in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| We support, equip, and empower people to create a safer and healthier community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| I just kind of want to speak on myself for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| A lot of people don't notice, but one of the greatest turning points in my life was actually getting shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3008)|
| 0:50:15| And being on that other side of the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| And even though I was able to hide what I was doing from the people whose opinions I value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| for months, all I could really think about was, what if I didn't survive that moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| What if that round that hit me in the leg, what if it hit me in my head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| What if I'm not here today to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| And I say that to put out there that a lot of the times we focus on the homicides, we focus on the murders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| not understanding the true impact that those who are fortunate enough to survive gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| the continuous impact that they have in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| And so that's why I came here today, to speak on that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| Because like I said, I feel like it seems only with gun violence that we seem to respond and repeat these tragedies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| by saying that mourning in that moment is acceptable, and not discussing any real action that needs to be taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| And as many people have observed, talking about what we could have did to prevent a young man or young woman from dying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| to me that's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| And so what are we doing to take any preventative measures to be proactive in this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| And I think that's what we're trying to do here today, is find a proactive solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Because whether we have people in here who agree or disagree with what it is that we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| we're all affected by it, and I feel like we all really kind of want the same goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| I think it's how we're approaching that task, and who's willing to really do the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| and understanding the roles that we all play here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| And so that's pretty much my spiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| I also feel like a lot of times we have this mantra that gun violence is too big for us to handle, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| And for some, it's too powerful to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| And it's too big for any of us to take some real and meaningful actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| and I feel like we all have, every person in here has the power and control to be able to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| what they want to live with and what they can't live with in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| And so today, you all can choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| You all can make that decision today to decide whether you're going to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| or whether you're not going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you, Mr. Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| Next person signed up to speak on this is Rashad Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| Mr. Woods, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| and you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| My name is Rashad Woods, 815 Radford Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| I think what's important is for me to explain how the work that we are proposing to do will be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| and why this program will be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| The people in this program are people who these younger people that are committing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| They tell me I can't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| You're not signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| Please don't interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Go ahead, Mr. Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| The people in this program are the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I mean, the people that these younger people who are committing some of these gun crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| who are running around carrying guns, they saw us growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| We're the people that some of us are the people that actually they're mimicking their lives after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| We may have changed our lives, but they're mimicking their lives after us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| We understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| We understand the situations they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| We understand their lives, so we can address them to maybe we can't stop all the gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| but we can interrupt some of the cycles and we can kind of slow it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| You know, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I know what it takes to get through to some of those younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3245)|
| 0:54:13| because I was like I was them at one point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| In order to make a change, you have to have the same, the people who were the poison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3258)|
| 0:54:28| you have to get the cure from the poison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| You can't go out with strangers and try to change anything in an area where the people don't know you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| they're not familiar with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Like we're familiar with these areas and the people are familiar with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| so it's easier for us to have access and try to stop some of these incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you, Mr. Woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| The next person signed up to speak in favor of this is Miss Nicole Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| Miss Davis, if you could come to the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3299)|
| 0:55:12| My name is Nicole Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| And I'm the aunt of Brittany Daniels and Phillip Tookie Stanford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| I'm here to share my story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| I've been surrounded by gun violence all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| And my niece, she was killed in a drive-by shooting at the age of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| We have a memorial, but it doesn't take from us not having her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| My niece was killed in a drive-by shooting on May 18, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| It was also the day of my brother's wedding day, and she was supposed to be a flower girl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| But that day was really interrupted, and there was nothing we could do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| Years later, a story that I haven't told anybody was about my nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3366)|
| 0:56:14| He also died from a gun violence, but it was self-inflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3374)|
| 0:56:21| I had to talk to my nephew and watch this happen to my nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| After he told me he loved me and that I was more of a mother to him than the mother that left him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3389)|
| 0:56:41| because he felt like God took his family from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And he was not—God didn't think about him at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| And that's a terrible thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| My niece passed from gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Her father later passed, two years later, from gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| His mother passed from cancer, which was my sister, Latoya Daniels, and I raised my nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| And my nephew, I told him the day that he did what he did—and many don't know that I talked to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| and we had a conversation—that I loved him like my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| And he said, besides his mother, God couldn't have gave him somebody that loved him, and he knew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| He knew that I loved him just as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| And I'm here to say I've sat in with the turnip knocks and I've listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| because I've been kind of worried about different things also, and I've seen different things happen also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| But what I've said and learned in these meetings, I want to be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| I've watched death, and I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| So I'm here for a reason, and that reason is to help, and I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Thank you, Ms. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Council members, there's a fourth person who signed up to speak in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| Is there your rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Okay, motion made to suspend your rules to allow a fourth person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| All those in favor? Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Okay, the motion to suspend the rules passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| The next person signed up to speak in favor of Item 11E is Jania Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| Ms. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| Thank you for saying my name correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| My name is Jania Holland, resident of 3215 Sunset Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| I am an alumni of SEED's Career Readiness Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| I originally started this program as just something productive to do because I already own my own business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| but I came out of this program now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| I'm a community engagement specialist and volunteer coordinator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| and this is what an eight-week program did for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3537)|
| 0:59:05| I could stand up here today and explain why I'm not a product of my environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| but we have another day for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3549)|
| 0:59:10| But what I do want to talk about is the youth and our young generation we have upon us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| One major problem we have today is the gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Just the beginning of 2021, we watched teens, mothers, and the whole entire school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| see the loss of six teens in a span of six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| Our reality is our generation needs the proper resources and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Turnip Knox knows the issues we as a community are facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| and Turnip Knox is ready to take the proper accountability to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Turnip Knox can and will help contribute to a safer and healthier community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| and the solution for that is a strategic plan that we have created to help build a better community for our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| The time is now for Turnip Knox and everyone a part of this program to break generational curses we have upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| The Turnip Knox program is the big step that our troubled teens need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| This program will be what helps decrease the gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| This will be what helps create a pathway and a successful outlet for the teens that are troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Thank you, Ms. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| Ms. Every has signed up to speak against 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| Ms. Every, if you could come to the podium, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3622)|
| 1:00:32| Again, not against, concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| So once again, one of the things I want to highlight about this situation is that it is great that we are addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| the youth gun violence, but in the last two known public cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| the individuals who were involved in some of those crimes for some murders and as well as some drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| it was people who were 35 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| So let's realize that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| And so when I see grown people, grown men especially, going back into a violent world, violent cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| it lets me know that attainment and accessibility is lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Another key factor that I'm concerned with is, as Ms. LaKenya has now openly expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| the 1.5 is not even actually here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| So the next question I have is where did this 450K come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| Is this part of last year's funding that was received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| or is this some type of advancement that the city is giving now to be paid back later once the grants are obtained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| The absolute factor of the question is how are we going to sustain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| What is the longevity plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Because we don't need a temporary five-second pop-up shop initiative that's going to shut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| build a lot of hope and aspiration only to come back and be a disappointment and disparity in the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| because funding ran out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| The other concern I have is it looks like it's a cart before the horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| because we've already initiated from what I saw in the agenda in this particular resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| we've already listed out the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| We've already broken it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| And I saw that almost 80% of the budget is going directly into people's pockets as payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| while the remaining 110K is going to be split up again amongst 20-so different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| So again, how impactful are these violence interruption programs going to really be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| if they're going to continue to lack the necessity of funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Again, city, because I'm still looking at you all in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| how are we addressing the core issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| and not still put in a blanket on top of a surface matter that has way more different deep and core impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| as the young lady mentioned, the generational cycle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| This is a cycle now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| And we don't need temporary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| We need longevity plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Strategic planning is one of my favorite words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| What council committee made these decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| Again, I feel like we're recreating the wheel because at least the equity task force already had that committee set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| There was a lot of partners that were already listed that are already community partners with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| And my biggest concern is that the affiliation with retired street members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Only one has that, and that was Safe Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Who do you think are going to be able to connect with these boys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| As has already been said here, you have to be able to speak that language to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| You have to come from that lifestyle, or you're not going to make a connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| And you're going to lose them probably even farther because they're not going to hear anything you've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| So I'm still concerned at, again, the models we're using and how we are approaching and, more importantly, implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| And, more importantly, the key part of this, the root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| The root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| Because someone else is going to be sitting in these seats soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And we can't keep having this same cycle of same approach, different face, same type of vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| That's not going to cut it no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| We have to get to the root of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| So that's one of my biggest ones, sustainability to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| What is our longevity plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And, more importantly, how are we going to catch everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Because putting people in jails to continue to profit for prison industrial complex is not the answer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| That's not going to help us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| We've got to give our boys more than just what they see on movies and in music and on video games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| They need real, live role models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| So, again, what are we really doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| Are we really addressing the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Are we really using the power of our pen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Are we continuing to be a part of the Knoxville plantation that I will continue to show up as Nate Turner to time and time again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3869)|
| 1:04:36| Because this won't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| We are not political stunts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| We are not temporary photo ops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| We are real people dealing with real life and real issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| And you all are not taking this serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| It is a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| And you prove it not by your words but by your actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Again, that is why I am running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Tennessee for everyone because everybody wins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Next person signed up to speak on this item in opposition is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| Mr. Roach, you want to come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3908)|
| 1:05:19| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| A clarification, I am not in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| I've spoken about a month ago, council meeting, about the whole process of being accountable and how we spend our money in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3927)|
| 1:05:37| Having been involved for the last 25 years at some level, it was odd that when I came in, I looked at the agenda items, I see C and I see D and I see E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3937)|
| 1:05:53| And they are so interconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| Mr. Grant, you posted about coming to support me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| I've worked with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| I love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| I'll support you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| I will support you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| But we can't do it like we've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| We can't do it like we've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| That's just a fact of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| And I'd love to talk to you later about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| Mr. Roach, this is your opportunity to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| That being said, we're going to have to have true accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| Again, Mr. Grant had asked for support, people to come out and support tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| But I know nothing about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| I know nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| I don't know who or what or how things are going to be targeted, resources are going to be targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| So I'd love to see that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| Grant proposal, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Who's going to do what, how they're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| What are the bullet points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| What are the targets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| Are they really attainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| I've seen enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| I've been on all, except for being shot, I've been on all ends of gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| I've had a gun point at my head doing something I wasn't supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4057)|
| 1:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| That was personal choice, bad personal choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| So now, I've been publicly threatened with potential gun violence and I had to back out of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4071)|
| 1:08:03| And it was done by a public community figure in public at Haley Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And all I was trying to do was get people information about getting help for their high rent that they were going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4090)|
| 1:08:18| And this was just a few months back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| And we can't address issues internally unless we're going to have complete honesty about what the real deal is and what people are willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4103)|
| 1:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Because to be honest with you, Knoxville is seriously involved in some serious political inbreeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| And it's going to have to stop if y'all want to really do something that makes sense and does a good thing for the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4127)|
| 1:08:59| primarily the black, brown, poor communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| We can't keep doing it like we've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I've watched this for 25 years and it's the same old, same old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| Money comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Money goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Few people are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| Few people looking good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| And we've gotten continuously, continuously, specifically the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| When I say the black community, I mean the people who reside right now in the city, in East Knoxville, Mechanicsville, Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4161)|
| 1:09:29| and more increasingly in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| I'm watching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| I've had a nephew die from gun violence by one of his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| I had to go speak at that victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| You know of which I speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Rick knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I'm tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| I am so tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| That's why I'm willing to work with you, Denzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| But we can't do it the way we've been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| I am no expert, but I got a little bit of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| And there's some deep stuff in here that a lot of y'all are involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| And we're going to have to have more accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| More people willing to speak up and say enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| And that's the higher powers, the ones that spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Council, that concludes people who have signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| I just wanted to give Ms. Middlebrook a chance to answer some of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| and tell us about this program because this is pretty brand new in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| although it's been done in other cities before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| So this, as council has before it, and the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| and framework are publicly available on the website if anybody wants to have a look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| and I'll be happy to provide a copy to anyone who would like to have a look at it also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| is to pilot violence interruption street outreach programs here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| These programs will be designed to engage with individuals who are at highest risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| or sometimes what we call proven risk of participating in violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| and also have a broader presence in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| and more direct engagement with community to help support reductions in violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4284)|
| 1:11:30| and community safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| So individuals who are working through this program will have the capacity to, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| do that direct engagement and support, that relationship building with some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| who are at highest risk of participating in violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| and building networks of support and community around those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| and helping connect to resources that are appropriate and necessary to support those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| and making different choices in, again, that direct community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| and building a sense of community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| It is critical, one of the things that is absolutely critical in effective street outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| is that these need to be folks who are embedded in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| and have a sense of relationship and a sense of trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| And one of the things that I believe Mr. Woods pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| is the necessity to have what is sometimes called credible messengers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| and folks who have a license to operate within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| and who can engage with the individuals who are at highest risk in a very real level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4351)|
| 1:12:39| And a lot of times those may be folks who have some experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| either with gangs or violence themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| And as you heard from some of the folks who spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| they know and understand these experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| And this is just a representation of some of the folks who have been participating in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| And so there is high opportunity for these programs to coordinate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| and work with other programs that are existing in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| One of the things that we saw as we were going through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| and especially assessing effective street outreach programs in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| is that sometimes some of these programs in other communities do try to reinvent the wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| and do try to kind of reinvent and recreate programs and resources within the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| and have everything in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| But we see an opportunity here to create better pathways for collaboration and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| with programs that are already existing that may be doing some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| that would be beneficial to the population that is being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| I hope that gives a little bit of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| That answered my questions and a bit more. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| One of the things I want to point out too is I was happy to hear that 80% of the money is going to pay people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| Community members have been volunteering their time and doing a lot of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| This is hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Most of the people who work in this field have gone through trauma themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| and deserve to get paid for the community work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| My biggest regret is still I did not ask for that $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| because I would like to have more people doing this and more people getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| I'm glad that this is a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| We're going to be looking at it for a year, and I am hoping by that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| we have pulled together the county mayor's office, all of the other key stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| because it's more than just Knoxville City that needs to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| The DA's office is willing to work with us, even the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| While they're doing this work, I hope we're able to organize and get our table together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| to get everybody on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Absolutely, and to your point, Councilperson Singh, that is work that is already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| It is really important for us that some of these things can happen simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| We don't have to wait for one thing to get done to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| You can multitask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Director Millerbrook, could you share more details about what would the average day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| for one of these violence interrupters look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| That day can vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| A lot of their time will be spent in community, engaging with members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| having conversations, having a presence, and building those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| They may be meeting directly or having conversations directly with program participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| or individuals that they are trying to recruit or engage in programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| They also will do a lot of work around trying to mediate and or de-escalate potential conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| They will, especially in kind of the early phases of the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4562)|
| 1:16:09| they will probably be spending a significant amount of time in some trainings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| to help them be better prepared to do this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| and then also supporting community events and working in community events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| and with partnership in other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| So that day will vary, but a lot of it is based in that community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| and that direct interaction with the communities most affected by gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| And what hours of the day would you say they'll be working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| So right now, the way that they are looking to structure the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| they'll kind of be working in shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| and most of those shifts would be focused around late afternoon into early evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| some over into the night during times when folks are out and about and engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| and also times when violence is most likely to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| But a lot of that will also be influenced by data that kind of gives us a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| of the times and locations in which violence is most likely to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| But most of it will be afternoons and evenings into the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| And will these violence interrupters be working alone or in pairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| Mostly in teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| There may be some opportunities and some circumstances that are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| for them to engage individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| but a lot of times when they're out in the community just kind of engaging more generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| and especially working at events, they will be in teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| And how did you reach the number of seven violence interrupters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| So that number was kind of based on the geographic areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| that are most directly impacted by violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| and trying to have two people with maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| a couple of those having the opportunity to float as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| and identifying folks who have ties to those particular communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| So looking at a couple of people for East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| for kind of the Mechanicsville, Lonsdale area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| and then also folks who can service South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| Montgomery Village area as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| And the proposal also describes some sort of data collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| and analysis that would be pursued, perhaps led by the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| I would love to hear what the approach to that data collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and analysis will be and any background experience you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| that will help inform that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| Okay, so that data collection and information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| I think we'll mostly be obtaining that information not only from the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| but also working closely with LaKenya| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| and also working with our new chief, Noel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| to collect that information while we're doing the actual work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| So that's where we'll be getting that data from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| And then what about the analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| The analysis as far as the metrics of what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| Just as far as the data that you're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| and what information it's telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I think we really, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| I don't think we can really pinpoint a sense of direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| as far as once we get our numbers and our data back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| And I think that's why we've decided to kind of make this a pilot phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| because as we've been meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| we haven't really been wanting to get too caught up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| in knowing what the answer really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, I feel like that first year, just being as transparent as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| we're actually going to be learning the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| That's just being honest because I feel like we don't have that true answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| And like I said, as I spoke to before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| I think that comes in with having enough people to back us with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| from your position, city council members, LaKenya, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| and law enforcement as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| making sure we do have a relationship with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| Back to Director Millibrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| Oh, shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| For determining where to focus the violence interrupters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| have you been able to map out the incidents of violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| that we have experienced in our city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| And if so, can you share that with city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| And the Knoxville Police Department Crime Analysis Unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| is very gracious in providing me with regular updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| as incidents occur, which maps not only homicides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| but also maps shooting incidents or shots fired reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| and incidents that involve any type of injury related to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| And so it maps each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| and provides a table that shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| based on each police district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| where the majority of those incidents are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| or how they are happening in each area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| and how incidents are concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| So that information is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| and is something that I consult regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| One of my concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| one of my major concerns with this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| is that when we approve the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| to proceed to engage in the research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| regarding the street outreach program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| what I anticipated coming back to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| was that report that painted a picture for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| of what are we dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| Where is the violence happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| Who's committing it and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| We should be able to paint that picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| In fact, it's one concern I've raised with KPD in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| that one thing that is lacking in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| is a community conversation about the violence going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| So many other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| when there is concerning events that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| a child's life that's lost to gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| we have press conferences and updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| and we get information about who these individuals are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| and what's the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| We don't have enough stories behind the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| of the gun violence victims in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| so that we know what occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| and we get a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| And we have so many unsolved crimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| but of those that have been solved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| what are those stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| Who are those individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| So that we as a community can collectively be a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| of ensuring safety for ourselves and for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| So I need that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| I need that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| I need to see that this is going to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| because what continues to happen in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| on issues that impact Black people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| is that this city will find Black people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| who aren't necessarily qualified for the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| and put them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| because they're loyal to city leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| And that keeps happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| And the only way that we address these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| is through that data and analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| If we only compile data and put it in a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| like Title VI does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| then that's meaningless to our ability as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| to create policy that stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| and prevents future racial discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| That's on the Title VI issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| So if now we start this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| and we got all this data coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| but we don't have folks who know how to analyze that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| and might analyze it incorrectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| so that we end up targeting...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| For instance, in our packet it says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| Oh, I can't remember the exact language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| but I think victims of gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| it's about 53% are Black men in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| There's some statistic like that in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| The way we talk about it in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| you'd think it was 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I was shocked that it was only 53%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| How do we pursue this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| and make sure that we have outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| and at the same time not criminalize our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| which is so easy to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| The policing that I see right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| is not just for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| It's not a just form of policing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| It's not what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| I'm still thinking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| whether I can support it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| because I want it to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| but there's nothing in this packet that has convinced me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| that we need to invest in seven violence interrupters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| versus five versus nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| and that's going to be what we need to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| I'm not convinced that a program has been put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| to be able to place people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| who are doing the violence interruption work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| in the places that they need to be to be effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| because I think we have folks, as you all have admitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| who are just learning what this is all about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| creating a plan before we have the research coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| And I have to tell you where I'm coming from on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| I'm coming from a background of violence interruption work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| Before I ran for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| I was the executive director of Peace Brigades International USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| training individuals and sending them around the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5219)|
| 1:27:03| to interrupt violence without guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| We call them unarmed bodyguards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| and we have projects around the world and also here in the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| When Cori Bush ran for U.S. Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| I got a phone call about threats being made on her life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| and I found individuals, sent them to Missouri| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| to provide unarmed protection for Cori Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| So I know what I'm talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| I know how to analyze situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| I know how to analyze data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| And I want to be helpful to this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| but what I have felt since I've tried to engage in conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| is resistance to that help, and that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| I think that we need a street outreach program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| but I think Safe Haven is doing it, and they need the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| And there's tension right now between the city and Safe Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| I don't really fully understand why, but they have the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| I applaud you all for caring enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| to want to commit to the work over the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| to learn about this work, and to build those relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| I'm just not convinced that's how we should start the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| Council Member McKenzie, then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Let me first start by saying thank you, Nikki, for being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| and for sharing your family's story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5321)|
| 1:28:44| For those of us who have been around for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| we know that when your niece Brittany was murdered in that drive-by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5326)|
| 1:28:55| there were some truces that were made in the streets with gangs because of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| and there was some peace because of the death of a baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| But today we're living in some totally different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| and there's no such thing for these young people in the streets as a truce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| If we want to know what's behind a lot of the murders and killings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| the majority of them are starting on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Some of them are gang activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Some of them are just people getting in an argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| looking at somebody the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| We are in a community, my community, in trauma right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| because of everything that we have experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| There's room at the table for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| and we'll take everybody working together to help solve and fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| And I'm not going to put a lot of family business in the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| but those of us who are from the black community, we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| We know some things that are going on that we just really don't talk about in public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| but they're things that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| They're family issues that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| And so with that said, and I appreciate everybody's passion that's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| I appreciate the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| I'm hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| This is a step in the right direction, so I'm going to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I know that this is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| I'm hopeful that we will see more people stepping up in our community to join in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| There are people already out here doing some of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| They just don't have enough people working together for whatever reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| This is going to take all of us working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| and not coming here pointing fingers at each other and infighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| That's been a big part of the problem in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| We'd rather fight each other than stand and fight together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| against the forces that's out here taking and killing our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| our young black boys and girls, and it's not isolated to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| It's every city in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| It's cities all across this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| If there was one answer and one solution, it wouldn't be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| Every city, every black community is dealing, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| with the same issues that we're seeing here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| And every weekend that we have that goes by, a young black boy or girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5477)|
| 1:31:22| a young man, a mother, father, whatever, is not murdered, that's a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| That's a good day in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| Chattanooga is now seeing the increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| and being plagued with all types of violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| But we've got to stop the infighting and say, how can we work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| So one thing I'll give you, Rick Roach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| is that you made a pledge to stand up and help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| but that's got to be consistent for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| If we're serious about this work and saving our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| we've got to lay some things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| We've got to lay some things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| And it's unfortunate that I have relationships with a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| that I just knew who they were before or didn't know them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| because they've lost somebody in their family that they loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| And my phone rings at 4, 5 o'clock, 6 o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| because somebody's having a moment, not understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| or just needing help and direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| We have to do better, and we're going to do better, and this is a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| So I applaud everybody that stood up that says, yeah, I'm in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| And do I have an issue with people getting paid to do the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Not at all, because it is work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| And so the heat maps, those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| that's evidence of where things need to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| But it's everywhere, and you're not going to be able to be everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| You all are getting paid, but you all also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| just like some other nonprofits, Safe Haven included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| put your lives on the line when you're out here in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| And that's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I'm hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| One of the things that I want to see happen is that there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| I want to learn more about what that partnership looks like with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| I'd like to see the people that are stepping up to do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| to be doing ride-alongs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| just to be able to hear from the officers that are patrolling in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| You all could probably give them some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| They could give you some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Those things are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| The shots fired, I think, are really concerning to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| because we know bullets don't have eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| and people do get shot and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Children, that happens quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| Those of us from the community, we know the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| or we should if we're really in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| of what happened at this latest murder in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| That should have never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Tempers flare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| These were friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| These were families who grew up together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| But I applaud the Lonsdale community for coming together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| for the elders in those families saying, not on our watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| We know the elements that went into the situation that exacerbated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| and that incident happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| and a young man killed his friend that he grew up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| Tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| Should not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Now, could violence interrupters have changed that scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| Probably not, because who would have predicted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| that a friend would kill another friend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| So I want to be really clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| because I don't want anybody to lay it all on this violence interruption program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| that that's going to solve everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| But is it going to have an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| Just like every other program that's out there is having an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| But I want to see the day where we all come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| and we're sitting at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| and we're talking about who's on point, who's doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| Time out for asking the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Most of us know the answers to the questions because we know the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| We know the people who've been murdered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| And it doesn't just stop at that victim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| The family is victimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| The family is victimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5694)|
| 1:34:55| Nikki just sat here and shared with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| how she raised her nephew and that young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| and she didn't tell the entire story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| This young man went to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| He was a basketball star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| And as much as she loved him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| she could not replace his mother and his father and his sister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| Because if love could have saved that young man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| he'd be sitting right there next to his aunt today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| probably in the NBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So we've got to come together, community, family, city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| All of us have to come together and stand together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| and that's what we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| These are the commitments that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| And is it enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| There's always more that we can do, and we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| But we have to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| We've got to stop the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| We have to stop the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| So I want to thank everybody for your passion, your commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| I don't question anybody's motives who wants to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| I just say be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Connect with the people that you need to connect with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| There are some people that I'm going to connect you guys with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| some of the families, some of the family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| We have a family out here who's lost two brothers within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5762)|
| 1:36:10| We know the family dynamics and what perpetuated a lot of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| And we know that that family needs help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| but there are members of that family that can be walking alongside of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| all to try to help save some of these kids too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| So I look forward to working with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you for your commitment and the work that you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| and everybody in this room that has a heart and a passion to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you, Councilmember McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| I don't think I can add anything to what Councilwoman McKenzie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| I just want to say to Mr. Grant and the others over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| I appreciate you stepping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| because there's a lot of us that have been sitting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| trying to figure out how we can help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| and we don't have enough money to solve all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| We have in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| So if there's something else we can do for you as you go along this journey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| and figure this out, ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| I know SEED is real big on asking people when they need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| So I appreciate you guys being willing to stand up and do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| Is there a second for the motion to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| Motion made to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| Well, she made the motion before I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| It's not a debatable motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5863)|
| 1:37:51| All those in favor of calling the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| Mr. Smith, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| Motion withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| I just think it's important that we have good plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| And for us to do our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| we have to make sure there's a good plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| It is not meant to be divisive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| But what I do consider divisive, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| is how the city continues to design these processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5909)|
| 1:38:34| When I talk to community members, they all want to come together and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5914)|
| 1:38:42| They want there to be a roundtable where groups are all pooled together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| at the table to discuss what they can do together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| My concern is that we are not supporting our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5932)|
| 1:39:02| and instead are identifying some weaknesses among our groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5942)|
| 1:39:12| and because of those weaknesses, creating a whole new thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| And to me, that's creating tension in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| It's not this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| It's not calling out the truth of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| But it's what we did at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| And we have to take responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| That has nothing to do with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| We are creating systems that bring this tension into our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| And we can do better to not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| I mean, we honestly don't have to create these tensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| And it's not about having $10 million to solve all the problems in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| but spending our money smartly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And I just don't see us asking the questions that guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| the proposals coming before us deserve the investment that we're giving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| So I will be supportive of you all as the work moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| I'm not able to support this measure tonight because I do not believe it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| proposal that has identified how the issues are going to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| by a street outreach team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Council Member Thomas and then Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Yes, I appreciate Council Person Parker's concern for planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| and gathering data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| And we all need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| This approach, I think, is going to have to leave room for a lot of creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6041)|
| 1:40:48| And what we have here is a concept which I can really appreciate and accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| And the concept, as I understand it, is to be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| for the most part, from those that I have seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| And it's more based in personal relationships and getting deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| into the communities and relying on a network of people in those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| that are respected, that are known personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| And it was good to hear the gentleman get up and say that he had a lot to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| because we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| And we don't know the complete blueprint yet for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| It's got to be a creative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| But what impresses me about this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| and it comes a lot from the conversation with Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| some of the conversations I've had recently with some of you folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| is how it is based into the community and it's based on personal relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| And it's getting into a level that is deeper than overall policy decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| that have been made or different formats for addressing problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| because it really is based upon people who know each other in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| and trust each other in the community and have a genuine concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| and it's not based upon an application of the law to commit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| you know, to enforce law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| The idea is to interrupt it, is to get there before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| At least that's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| And I get out in the street as much as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| and I go over into different parts of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| and I sit on people's front porches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| and these aren't people who have any kind of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| They, I'm not beholden to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| but I go out there and I really want to hear what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| And this concept is consistent with what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| and all I can go on is what I hear because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| we all come from different parts of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| You know, all of us have our struggles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| but all I can go on is genuine dialogue that I hear from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| who have no other reason than to tell me the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| You know, there's no other reason why they should not be telling me the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| So the main part I wanted to emphasize is the concept here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| is a fresh concept from what I've seen us try in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| and we can't know the entire format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| We're going to have to be creative and figure it out as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| And if this pilot program is a success, I'll do everything in my power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| and I think, I know all my colleagues up here will do everything in their power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| to find the funding, whether it's federal, state, local, to expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| So we'll be watching and hoping and working with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| and wishing you all the good luck, and I think it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| And if it does, we will evaluate it as honestly as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| and we want honest feedback from you all to see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| But after the year pilot, if this passes, we'll come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| and we'll sit back down and honestly try to figure out where we take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| So thank you all for showing up, and I'll help you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| This council has invested in pilots of all sorts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| but we've not halted one step in pursuing improvement in what this is focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| So I just want to read this from the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| There's a need for focused engagement of youth and adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| at immediate risk of involvement in violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Street outreach is an effective strategy for engaging individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| most difficult to reach and at highest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| What a worthy endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| And I can't think of a more worthy list of organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6318)|
| 1:45:24| who are already doing this good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| You know, this council has talked a lot about new initiatives, new programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| but what the city does really well is invest in organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| that have been doing this good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| And if you talk to these organizations and spend hours and hours with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| what they'll tell you is that they're saving kids now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| and all they need is to be empowered and supportive to save them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| And so I can only speak on behalf of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| My vote in support of this is to empower you to go save more kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| And I think thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| This is meant to be, I think, Councilman Thomas's comments are spot on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| about there's going to be some creativity in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| You will mess up, but we have your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| And I'm grateful for you taking on probably the most important endeavor in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| And so where there are no safe kids, there is not a safe city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| And I will go with you wherever you need to go to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| And you're welcome in South Knoxville anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| I just had to add quickly that I forgot to mention one of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| that really concerns me about this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| and one of the reasons why I can't support it is the insurance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| And I don't know why this work is requiring these massive amounts of insurance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6406)|
| 1:46:54| but you're not going to be able to subcontract with the grassroots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| because some of the groups that I've talked to who have received funding from the city already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| and got the insurance policies to get that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| are having a hard time maintaining the cost of these policies each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| I know each organization that I've worked for that I've run, you know, nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| we don't have all of these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| And we're sending, you know, I mean, seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| So working on this compensation, you don't have to have it as a nonprofit in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| if you have fewer than four employees, paid employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| So if we have a bunch of volunteers running an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6453)|
| 1:47:35| maybe one paid employee, they're not going to have compensation insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| So all of these things are, to me, it's creating this behemoth that's going to block out the grassroots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6461)|
| 1:47:51| And the city will have created their preferred groups who all have workman's compensation insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| and directors and officers' liability insurance, which my nonprofit doesn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| because it's so expensive to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| I mean, at least $5,000 worth of insurance policies that I saw listed in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| depending on what quotes you get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| So these things are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| These are things that are important as we begin programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| to understand what could be the long-term ramifications in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6497)|
| 1:48:22| from creating these types of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| And I forgot my other thoughts, so I'll stop right there, and we can go on with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| Council Member Reiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Yeah, so I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| Why do we have these requirements, and are they necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| Why can't we get rid of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| It's up to you to decide whether they're necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| But, yes, I think they're necessary because these folks are working one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| I mean, these are wonderful volunteers in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| but they're working one-on-one with other folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| And let's face it, we live in a world that is very litigious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| We live in a country that's very litigious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| And a lawsuit that's not backed up by insurance can ruin this group, can ruin the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6541)|
| 1:49:12| You can get this whole program started, and just one claim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| whether it's meritorious or not meritorious, just one claim can ruin all of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| And so it becomes necessary to make sure you've got that backstop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| in order to be able to give yourself the best opportunity for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6567)|
| 1:49:33| And so I think that's why the insurance requirement is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| It's our obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| We have a fiscal responsibility to the citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| We have a fiscal responsibility to the folks who sent us all here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| to make sure that we act in a fiscally responsible fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| And in today's world, insurance is a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Seeing no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| I just remembered my final thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| And I am going to end on a morbid point, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| But I just keep hearing folks say, we got your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Even if you mess up, we got your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| What I want to say to you all is I'm concerned about hearing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| because in this type of work, if you mess up, you could lose your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| And I know that sounds dramatic, but I'm not trying to be dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| If you are dealing with individuals who are willing to take someone's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| you need to know what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| And I think we commented earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| Our streets are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| The streets across the United States are dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| We talked about people have guns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| and they can fire those guns at any time for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| And this is why I think we were applauding these people for stepping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| because they know the risk that they're taking on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| They know that when they walk out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| absolutely they're putting their lives in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6675)|
| 1:51:19| So, again, I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| Is there a second for the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Okay, motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| It looks like there's no further lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Anyway, so seeing no further questions or comments, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6697)|

| 1:53:01| My understanding, because Parks and Rec has truly had the lead on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| is that we have the sidewalk component, but there's also equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6785)|

| 1:54:17| But in this role, we end up dealing with so many unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=6857)|

| 1:56:54| I'm not sure who to ask this question, but my concern is where is this money going to be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| A hundred individuals, that's $5,000 per person on dental work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| So I just wondered if this is going to just how is this going to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| I think there is already a clinic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| Mr. Spangler is here from Volunteer Ministry Center or Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7033)|

| 1:57:29| Bruce Spangler, 511 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Thank you for your question, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| In essence, we serve more than 100 folks, but in terms of reporting to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| that is what we will be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| But we serve at least 150 people every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| One of the things that this particular grant allows us to do is to hire a dentist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| who works with folks who are experiencing homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| and we tie that service to housing case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| So that's the reason why it's a little more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| because in essence it is paying for the salary of the dentist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7085)|
| 1:58:06| So you under-report how much good you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7088)|

| 1:58:13| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| I keep doing the math, Council Member Singh, and I get 540 per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| Am I doing it wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7101)|
| 1:58:24| I just want it to be clear for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| just because I also thought it was a huge amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| but every time I divide it by 100 I get 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| Anyway, I know it's definitely a need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| and most dental work is not covered by TennCare, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| So that's why we have, like, remote area medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| that's a large amount of the work that they do is dental work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| I know my husband's had patients with some pretty critical, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| abscess teeth and stuff, and they have nowhere to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| and they're TennCare patients because there's no options for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| So anyway, and even so, if we had Medicaid expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| they would have no dental work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Sad state of affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7147)|

| 2:01:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| Michael O'Malley, 2744 Woodbine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| I'm representing the Chihuly Park Neighborhood Association about a concern that was raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7304)|
| 2:01:55| in a few of our last meetings and I'm bringing this to public forum because I didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| an email or a response to my phone calls either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| Basically the concern is about our alleyways, so Chihuly Park, the neighborhood itself is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| north of Cherry, south of 40, north of Magnolia, east of Cherry, west of the park, south of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7331)|
| 2:02:19| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Fairly small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| We, like a lot of the neighborhoods in the area, have alleys where our trash pickup is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| done and where a lot of our driveways and back doors lead out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| And the concern is that those alleys are inconsistently lit and the main streets are fairly bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7350)|
| 2:02:37| Alleyways are checkered and the reason for this is how the alleyways are managed where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7357)|
| 2:02:46| people have to rent lights through KUB as opposed to them just being used in the normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| street light fund that the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| We have some neighbors who have expressed concerns about not feeling particularly safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| in the alleys after night, which is a problem given that sometimes they have to exit their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| cars from their driveways to go into their houses or take out the garbage, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7389)|
| 2:03:10| And we, like a lot of the rest of the city, experience the same sort of petty crimes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| you deal with, such as car break-ins, other kinds of theft, drug activity, those sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| of things, all of which have contributed to people not always feeling safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| And I imagine that other residents in other neighborhoods may feel similarly about their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| alleys as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| And so, as I mentioned, I think the issue has to do with how those lights are managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| So the city runs the main street lights, whereas with KUB you can install what they call private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7418)|
| 2:03:45| security lights to the alleys if you're willing to pay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7425)|
| 2:03:51| Willing to pay is kind of the issue, I think, at heart because to get one of these KUB private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| security lights, you have to pay a 75% installation fee after first calling for an inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7437)|
| 2:04:04| and estimate from a KUB technician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| If they find that they need to install a pole to hold that light, that's an additional $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| to the installation fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| Once you have all that installed, you also have to pay monthly for the light, which depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| on the wattage of your light can vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| The lowest 100-watt bulb would be $7.81 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| The highest, the 400-watt bulb, would be $17.21 a month added to your utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| And if you had to get the pole installed, that's $5 a month as well added to whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| you're already paying for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| So there are some not inconsiderable logistics as well as quite a lot of money involved if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| you want your section of the alley lit, and some people do that, some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| I think that as long as there are these financial and logistical hurdles, we're never going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| to have comprehensively lit alleys, either because people won't want to pay that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7497)|
| 2:05:04| people can't pay that amount, or because we have blighted properties or vacant properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| where there is no one to pay that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| So basically what the Neighborhood Association asked me to move forward with is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| city deal with alley lighting as well as main street lighting, which I realize would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7519)|
| 2:05:24| the city money, but I think has some tangible benefits as well, obviously making people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7524)|
| 2:05:30| feel safer, helping the logistics of trash pickup as well in the winter months when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| would be doing so during the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| You also have the issue of crime prevention, which we've already talked about a lot, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| there's a whole matrix of things that are involved with crime prevention, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| also second the people who said that poverty and other root causes are essential in addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| But you also have infrastructure causes as well in terms of crime and street lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7556)|
| 2:06:02| is among those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice study found that, and this is a direct quote from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| abstract of the study, that improved lighting can be a feasible, inexpensive, and effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| method of reducing crime and should be included as one element of a situational crime reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| So as opposed to many of the other very complicated and necessary ways that a city can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| crime reduction, this is a fairly simple way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| And while I realize, again, this would cost money and involve construction by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7588)|
| 2:06:36| I do think that it is worth considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I will be around after the meeting closes if anybody wants to talk to me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| I'll make sure a staff person speaks to you at the adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| Next person signed up to speak at public forum is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7609)|
| 2:07:01| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| I want to thank everyone who spoke on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| I look at those three agenda items, the mental health, the violence, crime stoppers and violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7628)|
| 2:07:16| prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| I don't separate those at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| They're intimately connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| I wish you could have probably bundled them together and had more professional boots on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7642)|
| 2:07:31| the ground come and speak to it or be in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| That would have made sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7655)|
| 2:07:38| Of course, lots of things make sense to me that make sense to no one else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| So we can run with that if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7661)|
| 2:07:48| The other thing is, again, is the lack of accountability at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7668)|
| 2:07:56| And Councilwoman Parker addressed it over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| If we don't get people to do not just the financial part of the auditing process, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7684)|
| 2:08:13| the forensics part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7693)|
| 2:08:14| In other words, if you say, if you're coming in with a program and you say you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7694)|
| 2:08:18| to do these things, okay, and you say you're going to do them within a certain time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| and you're going to come up with a particular result, and you have that auditor come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7703)|
| 2:08:28| and go, okay, did you do this and did you do it for the money that you accepted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| And we don't have that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| And it's my understanding, again, we have one auditor for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| And it is my understanding that we have multiple occasions where that person has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7722)|
| 2:08:51| help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| I don't know where that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| The city of Knoxville, a city this size, one auditor, with all the different avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| of monies coming in, revenue coming in, that, when I was doing that in Parmesan stuff 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7745)|
| 2:09:16| years ago, man, they were on our behinds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| You know, it was HUD, that was federal government money, other people's money, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7761)|
| 2:09:28| And we had accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| We did a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7770)|
| 2:09:31| We designed programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7771)|
| 2:09:32| And they said, okay, well, meet these criteria, you get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| Sometimes we met the criteria, still didn't know where the money went, okay, at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| Millions of dollars somewhere left on the table out there in the financial city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| world, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| No accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| We tried to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| I attended so many PNC meetings, or PNI, Partnership for Neighborhood Improvement, who was acting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7800)|
| 2:10:12| on behalf and was contracted to community development at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| Never could get any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| We get all this runaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| And it's going to happen again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| It's going to happen again, it is happening, until you get somebody in here to watch the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7826)|
| 2:10:33| numbers, pay attention to the numbers, and make sure that the programs are adhered to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7833)|
| 2:10:42| the way they are projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| Because if we don't, you know, we're going to have the same problems, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7847)|
| 2:10:54| We're going to be having another program pop up here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| The numbers say 47% poverty in the black community in Knoxville, at that poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7859)|
| 2:11:05| If it's gone up, it has to have gone up, because the last two years, the last two years, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7865)|
| 2:11:13| the inflation rate and the employment rate and the rate of pay for people has not stayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7873)|
| 2:11:22| together, there's more poverty, there's more poverty, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| So something's got to start fitting together here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7890)|
| 2:11:38| So more accountability, I'd love to see that somehow, some way, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7898)|
| 2:11:45| That means hiring people to do the job that can start that process of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7913)|
| 2:11:54| Council members, that concludes public forum, and without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220614?start=7914)|
