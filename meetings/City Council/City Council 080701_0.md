| 0:03:38| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Okay, all those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=219)|

| 0:03:44| Any other ideas for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| I guess, Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| 12B, which is the parking ordinance, do we have a. . . I know that's to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| Have we talked about how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| I think we did talk about how long, and I think it was a bit of a. . . it's in the minutes from last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| I think it was. . . I think it was four. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| Four seems safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Yeah, was it. . . Cindy, will you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Was it six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Is Terri here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Terri was. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| We have collective Alzheimer's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Terri, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Help me, Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Terri has never been wrong that we can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| And they have set their first meeting date, so I think that hopefully that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| Do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=273)|

| 0:04:36| I would like to request that it be six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Mr. Hall has now moved that that be put back an additional two weeks, so it would be for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| If nobody has a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| The second from Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| I'm seeing mostly head nods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=291)|

| 0:04:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| I have a person I know that wanted to say something about that, and he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| You're welcome to call on him if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Mr. Hatton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| I wanted to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| John H. Hatton, 2315 Monterey Road, here in Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=319)|
| 0:05:29| My condition tonight is angered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| This thing about parking your car in your yard has upset me and most of the neighbors around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=334)|
| 0:05:44| I have a condition right now where I've been back and forth one week to the other, one week to the other, three times in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=344)|
| 0:05:55| I find it very upsetting that this body wants to tell me that my wife cannot take my car, drive it up in my yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=355)|
| 0:06:07| and park next to the front porch because of my medical condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| And when she parks it, we're both retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| That car may sit there two, three, four days unless something happens where we need medicine, we need food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=377)|
| 0:06:27| or one of the grandchildren calls and says, I want to spend the day with Mimi and Pappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| Until then, the car may or may not move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| And I understand that that's going to be illegal to park my own car in my own yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| Most of the time, it's in the back where you can't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| But I have neighbors that have very small driveways that park in their yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| because they've got the wife, the husband, a son, a daughter, all four cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| They've got a driveway that's very, very short, barely holds one car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| They are forced to park in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| One time, the son decided, okay, I'll park on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| One time, his truck got vandalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| The next time, they stole his license plate off his vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| So now he's parking back in the yard close to his house for safety of his vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| There's another situation where most of the people in my neighborhood have got boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| I'm not talking about fishing boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I'm talking about luxury boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| They all park in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| What do I think about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Am I displeased about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| That's the only thing I've got to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| I'm insanely jealous because I don't have one, and that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| But that's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| I think people have taken a good idea as far as parking a car in the front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| the wheels off of it, the doors off of it, and the weeds going around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| But this thing that you're talking about now, you are going too dead blame far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| You are not passing laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| You are now meddling in the right to be American and a right to have his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| and a right to have his vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Just so I'm clear, we're giving this ordinance to whom, to do what with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=496)|
| 0:08:24| I believe that a committee was appointed, which was made up of the neighborhood coalitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| from across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| And they agreed at the workshop to work on this and to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=512)|
| 0:08:42| All of their meetings will be public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| and the public is invited to all of their meetings to get public input on these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| such as Mr. Hadden brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| And they'll come back with some feedback, not necessarily a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| I would assume it would probably come back in the form of a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| somewhat like the accessory building recommendation came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| But that will be up to them to determine how they want to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I wanted to comment that I've heard from a number of people about this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| and spoke with a woman today who lives in Mr. Hall's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| and just wanted those who are serving on this committee to be aware that there are certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| so many different individual situations of which we'll need to be sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| In this particular citizen's case, she and her husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| and her four adult children all live at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| One adult child, unfortunately, has just gone through a divorce and has moved back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| One adult child's husband is serving in the military, and so she's moved back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| So, you know, there's all kinds of situations of which I think we need to be sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| in crafting this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And I think that was the purpose of referring it to a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| where the public would have an opportunity to have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Mr. Boyce-McCaw had also signed up to speak, and we'll go ahead and recognize him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you very much, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| I'm Boyce-McCaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| I live at 4710 Washington Pike, 50% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| and 15% of the time I live at 3019 Johnston Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| I would stand here and oppose this ordinance in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| The best way I'm against dirty lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| and I know some of you councilmen that have some seriously dirty lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| I believe that if you were to take this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| and place it in the form of not just a vacant dirty lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| but a dirty lot requiring people like Mr. Becker to clean up his yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| I believe that as long as you're going to be the leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| then you need to clean your house up yourself and have a nice-looking neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| You can drive out East Columbia Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| and there's more violations out through there than you can shake a stick at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| But when you come off and say that Lonsdale to Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| you're just blacklining those of us who try to upkeep our property in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| There's more and worse spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| My driveway at my Lonsdale property, I park my cars there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| The city for years had been dumping sewer, raw sewer, onto my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| It has undermined my parking lot, and it has become a lagoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| and I can't get the city, although you're under an injunction now to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| and the court's going to make you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| it's going to be fixed one way or the other because you're going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| and the court's going to force you to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And I think, I'm like the gentleman that just spoke, I'm paralyzed from here down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| and I'm thankful I was paralyzed from here down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| It's tough on our wives to have to take care of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| You tell me I can't park at my house in Washington Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| and it looks better than any of your yards anywhere in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| that I can't park there where it's easy for my wife to get a wheelchair to me and move me out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| I think that's arrogance of the highest degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| and I'm going to pursue this matter in court or through this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=745)|
| 0:12:34| It's very costly to go through the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| I just spent $35,000 getting you people injunctioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| or enjoined from dumping raw material onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| You know, justice is very slow, but it grinds exceedingly fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| and that's what's happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| And I just hope that you will take this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| and think about the disabled people that can't come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| It's hard for me to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| And I pay as much taxes probably as maybe one or two people here anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| and we don't get our money's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| But you able-bodied people, you make everything nice for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| If you want to go through Lonsdale and look at the improvements we've made on our Lonsdale property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| you can't compare it to Sequoia Hills like you did in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| That's silly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| But you can compare it to your house, the one you live in and walk out of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| and when you can't even see your backyard, there's something terribly wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| The only thing you can see is political signs in your yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| and then you're going to condemn my wife to have to do all this shifting me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| from wheelchair to crutches to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| It's unreal. It's unreasonable, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| You know, I thought she was going to be a good mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| but you've been the worst we've ever had, and that's a sad fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| And I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| The motion is to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=859)|

| 0:14:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Any other items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| Mayor, I think we have some consent items tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=871)|

| 0:14:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| We might want to talk about taking 11Y off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| That person might not retire if we don't pass this, and we might want to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=878)|
| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I'll take it that was facetious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Only modestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=892)|

| 0:15:33| We're going to celebrate the completion of our first ENERGY STAR certified home project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| with a ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| It's at 3339 Selma at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=944)|

| 0:15:47| I'll get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Tomorrow, which is the 2nd, we're doing it at 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| The city's community development program will be hosting that, so I would urge all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| of you to come help celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| The last sundown in the city is this Thursday, July 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| We've had a successful year, and lots of folks from all over the area have had a great year there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| Downtown North continues to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| The city, along with MPC and the KCDC, will host a public meeting next Tuesday, July 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| on planned improvements for the downtown north I-275 redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| The meeting is set for 530 over at the Knox County Health Department at 140 Dam Run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| So, again, that's next Tuesday, 530, the public meeting on planned improvements for the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| And then just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| I think everybody is aware, obviously, but the 4th of July is right upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| and the 4th of July festival, as always, at the World's Fair Park will be a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| It starts at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| We'll have live music on the WDVX stage from 3 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| The symphony will start playing at 8, and then fireworks start at 935.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| So that's one of the great fun events of the year in Knoxville, and I urge everyone to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| Okay, reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| Seeing none, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1022)|

| 0:17:51| Has anyone signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| We have no one signed up to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| We do have some people here who do want to speak, so the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Council, would you like to hear from folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Yeah, I'd like to recognize everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| The way our rules work, it's okay if you didn't sign up, but three people can speak in favor, three people can speak against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| and then the ones in favor can have a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| So I don't know if the folks who raised – is there anyone here to speak in favor of the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| I don't think I see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Someone who'd like to speak against, you can come up if you'll just move to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1104)|
| 0:18:34| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| My name is Keith Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| I live at 4145 Forest Glen Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| It's not really against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| I'm somewhat concerned of deeming a dog a level one dangerous dog on a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| The concern is the determination of what unprovoked attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1135)|
| 0:19:04| My concern as a citizen is that I'm not able to take my personal dog for a walk because of all the dogs off-lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1144)|
| 0:19:13| I don't know if anybody saw the news this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| Somebody was walking their dog on lead to – not Knox County, but two dogs off-lead attacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| A dog was killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| My concern is that we need – I'm a member of the Tennessee Valley Kennel Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| As responsible dog owners, nobody wants to be near a dangerous dog, a nuisance dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| We would like to see leash laws firmly carried out, which I live in the Sequoia Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1177)|
| 0:19:47| I can't take my dog for a walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| My dogs are always on lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| They're always behind fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| I have a terrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| If an unleashed dog were to charge my dog, it would probably fight back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1197)|
| 0:20:07| Is that unprovoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I'm not willing to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I would just like to see firm enforcement of existing laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| I think the animal control needs to have authority to enforce laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1220)|
| 0:20:28| but to determine what unprovoked and a mandatory spay-neuter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| I'm not sure that's the way to go when we can't control what's already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| So it's not really against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I just would like to see – I'm not sure we have the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| or the manpower to enforce what we have on the books right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| All of us are here as responsible dog owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| We don't want dangerous dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| We don't want nuisance dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| We don't want people to curb their dogs, to pick up after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| Let's focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| We would like to help the city come up with some enforceable laws, workable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| people that have experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| This is our hobbies, our passions, what we really enjoy doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| I don't want un-neutered dogs running around any more than anybody else does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| but I'm not sure as a responsible dog owner this is the direction we need to go at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Anyone else who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Just give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| My name is Roberta Galante, and I live at 5938 Westmere Drive, Knoxville, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| The part of the, quote, dangerous dog ordinance that really concerned me was the automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| mandatory, no-discretion spaying and neutering of a dog that's designated as level one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1315)|
| 0:22:06| most of the information on the level one seems to be it allows a dog to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1326)|
| 0:22:16| to go back and not be level one anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| I don't see the point in having something that's permanent be applied to a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| I mean, you're punishing a dog and its owner for something that may have occurred once at the vet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| you know, getting out of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| I'm just saying that it's too extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| It's too extreme to do this at level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| If dogs are truly dangerous, then you can petition the court or something to have them spayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| but it's, I think, is an automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| It gives no one any discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| It has, you don't have any opportunity to even exercise common sense or redress a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| It's just, it's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| And I just think that's, you know, an extreme action to take at the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| We have one more, or by rules, one more speaker, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1389)|
| 0:23:19| You can give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| My name is Heather DeBoard, and I live at 6117 Weems Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| And I would actually like to commend the city council for going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| You are aiming for legislation that is dangerous dog as opposed to dangerous breed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| and I think that's groundbreaking in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| because we have many communities that are aiming at specific animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| I believe we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I'd like to tweak it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I am also opposed to the mandatory spaying and neutering of a level one dangerous dog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| because there is the opportunity for them to earn the privilege of losing that label.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| I really support the part about having the dog go to obedience classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| and be able to pass a canine good citizen test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Part of the citizen test is to be able to be around another dog, to be around people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| I think that's the right direction to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I would like to give owners whose dogs have made one mistake have the opportunity to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| I believe that the responsible owners will do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| They will train their dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| They will make sure that their dog is well contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Those that don't care or actually have a dog who are out of their control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| their dog may move to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| But I believe that we need to give our citizens the opportunity to fix the mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| because sometimes you find out later that an attack was not actually unprovoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| The dog may have had an injury that you didn't know about at the time or an infection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| and petting the dog actually was painful to it and it was a defensive bite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| If you have jumped to spaying or neutering the animal, you've made an irreversible decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| So I would like to see us hold off on the spaying and neutering portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| and continue with the enforced obedience classes and canine good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| I've had numerous phone calls and e-mails on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| and there were a couple of questions about the genesis of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| and I'd like to call on our officer from animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| I understand from Chief Roehl that she was part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| If you could give us your name and title, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Hi, I'm Officer Christina Wilson with the City Animal Control Unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Officer Wilson, as these amendments were being crafted and proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| and they came through the Animal Control Board, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| I know that this council passed the original dangerous dog legislation two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Had there been a problem with enforcement of our existing ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| or process in terms of enacting those in the past two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| No, it has not been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| We have been taking action to enforce the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| That has not been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| The problem is on a court level, many times on a level one designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| it says minor injury, which states that it's not a broken bone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| it's only pain, no bleeding, and no death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| However, many of the cases that we do bring forward to the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| are lowered to a level one or maintained at a level one as to give the owner a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| So the majority of the bodily harm that's coming to the person and or the animal is a severe injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| meaning that there is bleeding, there might be bone and or death by the animal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| So this is the only issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| and that's why I believe that the amendment is a good amendment as to the spaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| and neutering of the animal because many times a level one designation dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| just since I've been with Animal Control for two and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| has escalated to be a level two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you for helping us to understand how this came forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| because I think as a council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| I was not aware that there had been any problem with our ordinance as it stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| or the enforcement of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| And the number of questions that I've had from folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| stated that they felt like the language regarding a level one designation is somewhat broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| that the city is oftentimes not able to widely enforce the leash law as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| and if a dog is not restrained on a leash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| then you have an issue of a possible incident occurring and it's not clear where fault lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| And a lot of concerns about an animal or a dog owner not being able to earn redemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| after an irreversible procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| And the way the consequences stand now for a level one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| if there's not another incident after 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| and that animal owner follows the mandates judged by the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| then that level one designation drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| I think it's important to distinguish here that we're not talking about mandatory spay-neuter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| for all animals, you know, for the whole dog population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| We're just talking about moving spay-neuter up from a level two consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| to a level one consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| And as I stated when we discussed this four weeks ago when I asked for the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| I really have a concern about that particular item in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| And so I would like to move to postpone to delete the mandatory spay-neuter in level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| You said postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| I would like to move to amend this ordinance to delete the mandatory spay-neuter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| as a level one consequence but maintain the other amendments to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| So the motion, just to be clear, is to amend, not to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| We'll make sure that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| There's a second from Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| I see a couple of lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| I'll go to Mr. Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Yeah, I guess, you know, Ms. Rowdy, it's a good thing to talk about and to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I guess I fall back on just how many dogs there are, how many dogs we put to sleep every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| how many extra dogs there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| You know, at some level, I think the concern people are raising about we can't enforce the leash laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| I'm like the first speaker, there are places I won't walk my dogs because there are dogs that get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| and I'm worried about them being attacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| And some of that says if we've got plenty of dogs around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| and I know there's some issues about expensive dogs, but it seems like we have too many dogs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| There are proposals to say that all dogs should be neutered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| So I don't know that saying we're going to neuter the dogs that have bitten somebody is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| So I don't think I'm going to be supporting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| And I guess I also wanted to just check because the original ordinance is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| My recollection, and I think, Ms. Rowdy, you were really helpful on this, the unprovoked attacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| we added some language to the original language that said, you know, if a dog is on its own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| it can't be found guilty of an attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| After two, when we did this two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| the level one designation comes after a single incident off the property or two incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| Two on, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| On.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| So if somebody comes on my property and my dog bites them a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| If it's a second time, then it's a mandatory spay and neuter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And there's no provision for the judge to exercise any discretion in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| All the consequences are listed as mandatory for the judge at that court hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I understand the motion, and actually it makes good sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| except for I have one question that really, I guess, is a hypothetical or factual question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| Maybe our officer for mental control or someone from the law department can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| As I understand it under the ordinance as it currently is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| you have that 18-month redemption period if a person does A, B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| The level one tag can be removed from a dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Does that mean hypothetically we could have someone, a dog that could be level one over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| after a two-month period and never get to the level two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| If so, is that something we need to look at down the line to come back to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| My concern is you've got a person who does everything they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| level one gets removed off their dog, something happens a year later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| they get back in the process, level one again, do everything they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| 18 months passes by, 18 months passes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| So can we be in a cycle like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| And if so, maybe not tonight because I can't craft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Maybe the law department or animal control, you all can get together and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| while we have that redemption period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| let's not get ourselves caught in some cycle where we have someone that can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| It's kind of like what happens with these homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| and we send out and we say this home has not been taken care of and it's a blight on the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| and needs to be torn down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| and then a recalcitrant owner comes in and throws up a bucket of paint on one wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| and that process has got to start all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I don't want us to be in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| I do think it makes sense that at this level for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| not a severe appearance like neutering or spaying of a dog at a level one level after this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| but I don't want to have that hole there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So I just put that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| If that's already contemplated and dealt with, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| But if not, we need to consider that because if not, we could find ourselves in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Do you want to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Was I off on my hypothetical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| That makes sense, Madam Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Well, the Vice Mayor studied this so well, don't need to say anything but almost amen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| because this was what was going through my mind was those repeat situations which become cyclic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=1997)|
| 0:33:24| and that's something that I know in many neighborhoods does occur with the same animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| and those are the complaints that we get that there's no resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| So I don't know how we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Can I just make a request that while we move forward today, I guess, with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| especially if the amendment is going to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| that maybe the law department along with the police department take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| and see if we can do an amendment in the future that closes that loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And, you know, obviously it would be something along the lines of if a dog has been level one designated before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| that hadn't been presumed previously, you know, and then gets back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| even though it has been removed through the redemption procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| that it would then, you know, be designated a level two or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| I don't know how you would word it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| But someone needs to look at that so that we don't have that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Three strikes and you're out, baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Law Director Poplin is much smarter than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| so I'm sure she'll craft the right language and bring something for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| We're now going to vote on amending the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| But, Ms. Wright, if you'd express it, I just want to make sure we're all straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| My motion is to amend the ordinance in front of us by deleting item number section 3A-7 at the bottom of page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2077)|
| 0:34:48| and that would be to delete the mandatory neutering or spaying of a dangerous dog at level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| So if you look at your ordinance, bottom of page four, number seven, my motion is to delete that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| and the rest of the items to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| That's been motion, second, discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| So right now we're going to vote on that motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| We'll do a roll call real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I think I just heard two, but we'll be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Councilman Whitlow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2133)|

| 0:36:34| to establish a public art committee to deal with the acceptance of and placement of art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| in public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| I apologize for maybe this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| So, will this committee be over dealing with all the public spaces that are a part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| city's inventory, even down to rec centers and places like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Theoretically, that could be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| It's not limited in area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| So, any place somebody would want to place public art, the committee would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| And this not only deals with, I guess, our building inventory, but this is open spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| also, like parks and street corners and all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| That just sort of brings a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| I know a time or two recently it's come up that someone wanted to place a memorial or something of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| that sort in a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| Would that be considered to come under this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| It's not really art, but it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Would be a statue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Yes, I believe this would be covered by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| But not signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Or would that be included as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Signage would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| What if it's artistic signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Ms. Rodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| I'm looking at page 3 of this ordinance, and I know we made some clarifications last time about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2268)|
| 0:37:55| appointments of the membership of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| And in section...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Right in the middle of that page, section 2-1112, it spells out who will be on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| And the last sentence is the one we tinkered with last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| It says, at least one member will be a city council member appointed by the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And I just wanted to make sure that the council was comfortable with that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Would it be better if it read, appointed by the city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| Or is that something that you feel like the vice mayor should...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| Typically, we work in a very collegial manner and do a good job of handling these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| But I just didn't know if that expressed how we wanted this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| Can I say, as a vice mayor, that language, I think, would be consistent with at least what other documents read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| It says, I guess, appointed by the vice mayor with approval of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| That even happens with some of the other committees, like audit and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| We still bring it in formally here to council in a resolution form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| So we could do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| And that makes it consistent with some of the other committees we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| And I think maybe that would deal with that, if that's acceptable to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| But I would like to see that added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Would you like to move to amend in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Yeah, I'll move to amend that we add subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Appointed by the vice mayor with approval from council or subject to approval of council, whichever one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| I forget how it reads in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Right now it just says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| In other ordinances and other deals, other appointments of the vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| it either says subject to the approval of council or with the approval of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| So basically, procedurally, what would happen is, whatever name I come up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| that would be a resolution that would come before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| That would be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| It would say council members, so-and-so, recommended by the vice mayor, is appointed to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| And then everybody would have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I second that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| And then in section B underneath there, I think we would need to tinker with that language a little bit, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| so that it reads that all committee members will be confirmed by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Right now it says that with the exception of the city council member appointed by the vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| everybody else is confirmed by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So some revision there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Strike the first part of that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| I guess strike with the exception of the city council member appointed by the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| Except then it says all committee members shall be appointed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and there's one committee member that's appointed by the vice mayor through council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| However that needs to read to reflect that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| I think we all know the intent there is that council would approve not just the mayor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| but also the one that was selected by the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| And that's what the amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| I see some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| I don't want to get too off the wall here, but if someone wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| I don't think we allow, one of the controversial things, Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| is on the state highways there's been this whole thing about memorials to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| you know, accident victims and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| And I think Tennessee law currently does not allow them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| but I know some states are, you know, made provisions for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| Is that kind of thing going to come under this, or are we just prohibiting those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Have you looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Has anyone looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| It hasn't come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| The intent certainly was not to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| That wouldn't be considered art, but somebody said something about memorials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| That's what made me wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| And the reason I made that comment was because we have a memorial now in West Hills Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| It's a Holocaust memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And I was wondering if that type of request would be covered here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2498)|
| 0:41:46| I had that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| And, you know, you could call it art or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| but it is a design that was presented and then with that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| So I was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| I was pointing that out because I recall when that discussion came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| and that was not something that council approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| because I believe one of the state legislators had involvement in that, if I'm correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| In a city park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| In the West Hills Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| No, he just instigated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| He didn't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| We actually did approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Well, see, I didn't know how the approval ever came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| We just knew that it came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I think it is a good example of one that probably from now it should go in some group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Rather than just administrative approval, that should be, I would say so, too, by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| That should be included, whether we do roadside memorials or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Anybody vote on the amendment then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Did we vote on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| All those in favor of amending, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080701?start=2566)|
