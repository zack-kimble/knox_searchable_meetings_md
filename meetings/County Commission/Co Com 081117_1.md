| 2:52:12| And somebody would come along and have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| And I would suggest to you that if they're dissatisfied the way they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10336)|
| 2:52:23| that you get together whatever committee can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| We let them have it for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10347)|
| 2:52:31| And to look after it, to maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10351)|
| 2:52:36| I was there often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| I never left it until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10359)|
| 2:52:43| If you have any questions you ever want to ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| not only on that question, but others that we've lived with for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10365)|
| 2:52:53| I'd be glad to have a committee of the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| to ask me the things that you would like to know why we are where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10377)|
| 2:53:05| And always remember, when you look out the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10385)|
| 2:53:09| you can say to yourself, as I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10389)|
| 2:53:12| when I became county judge, it didn't just happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| It just didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| Somebody, some group caused it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10398)|
| 2:53:24| If it was wrong now, it was wrong then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10404)|
| 2:53:29| If it was right then, it's right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| I think you have a few questions for Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10415)|
| 2:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10418)|
| 2:53:47| I just about wish we could take the rest of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| and hear about a lot of the other ways that government was run in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10429)|
| 2:53:52| I think there's a lot we can learn from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10432)|
| 2:53:55| I do have several questions, and then I may make several comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10435)|
| 2:53:59| And I was wondering, and you're probably the person that could answer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| are there other counties in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| particularly in the larger cities like Nashville or Chattanooga or Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| where the counties are running their own nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| or is this a unique situation here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| Well, what really gave us the idea to do this at George Maloney Home was Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10458)|
| 2:54:25| Bill Browley became county judge in 1950, served later on as the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10465)|
| 2:54:32| if you're familiar with politics at all in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10472)|
| 2:54:36| And he took his poor farm and he built a nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| and a home to look after people, whether they were sick or old and poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| just exactly like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10487)|
| 2:54:50| If you ask me what Wilkes-Thresher did down in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10490)|
| 2:54:55| whom I knew quite well, I don't think I'd ever ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10495)|
| 2:54:58| But I can tell you that counties all over Tennessee had poor farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10498)|
| 2:55:04| Sevier County had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10504)|
| 2:55:06| I've been in their poor farm back at the time they had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10506)|
| 2:55:10| Jefferson County had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10510)|
| 2:55:12| Granger County had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| Is that the question you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10518)|
| 2:55:19| Do they still have those today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10519)|
| 2:55:20| Does Granger County still have their county-run nursing home, or does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| I'm asking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10525)|
| 2:55:26| I have no idea whether they built a nursing home or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10526)|
| 2:55:30| I was interested, of course, in the four counties that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| but three of them particularly, Knox County, Davidson County, and Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| The only reason I mention that, and I agree a lot with what you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10540)|
| 2:55:44| is that we do have to look after the poor or the underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10544)|
| 2:55:52| The way that things have changed over the years is that there have been new federal programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10552)|
| 2:55:56| that have come into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| For instance, in the late 1960s, we had the Medicare program that took care of our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10559)|
| 2:56:06| And since then, we've had other federal programs that are combined state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| and federal programs such as Medicaid to help take care of the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| whereas in the past we didn't have anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10573)|
| 2:56:16| and the counties had to provide facilities to take care of the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10576)|
| 2:56:20| But now there's other mechanisms for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| And I was just going to make a comment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10583)|
| 2:56:28| And then the other issue is how can we best take care of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| even if they are Medicaid patients right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| which are the poor that fall under this combined state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| and federal program that we do call Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| If we do need to, we can keep facilities the way they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| but if we're going to upgrade them, if we're going to make it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| not just have a place for them to stay, but to make them better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| what is the best mechanism to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10613)|
| 2:56:56| I guess the county could just take taxpayers' money and put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| but sometimes if we turn it over to either a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10621)|
| 2:57:06| you know, one of these 501c3 organizations such that the Hillcrest Healthcare Communities Organization is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10626)|
| 2:57:13| or some sort of private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| they can use the equity that they have in the buildings to borrow money to make the services better for the underserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10635)|
| 2:57:23| And they can't do that under the present situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| If they do want to build new buildings, they do want to upgrade services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10646)|
| 2:57:29| they want to provide things that aren't being provided for the underserved now, they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10649)|
| 2:57:34| And I don't know which direction we'll go with this, but if we keep it exactly like it is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10654)|
| 2:57:40| it's going to stay the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10660)|
| 2:57:42| Whereas if we change that relationship, we have the opportunity of actually making it better for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10662)|
| 2:57:47| And I'd like to hear your comments or thoughts if you have any on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| Well, there are all kinds of grants that you can get for equipment, if it's equipment that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| There's still a Hilbert money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| There's money from the state health group besides Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10679)|
| 2:58:05| Somebody has to sit down and file the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10685)|
| 2:58:11| You have a board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| On that board of health ought to be the mayor of your town and the chairman of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10693)|
| 2:58:22| so you can meet with them and see what their thoughts are in relation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| You have a county physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| We had Ira Pierce, who was great until, of course, mine took over eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10708)|
| 2:58:37| And you've got the finest health department out there that can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| And when you go into the question of what should we do with our nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10721)|
| 2:58:47| what other facilities are recommended to be placed there in the way of equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10727)|
| 2:58:54| certainly not in the way of a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10734)|
| 2:58:57| Nothing wrong with a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| The question is what are the things you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10739)|
| 2:59:06| As you probably know, I've been in the hospital business with shriners, children's hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10746)|
| 2:59:14| served on the board of trustees for 20 years, of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10754)|
| 2:59:20| And I've been through the question of change from the time you were trying to save them from polio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10760)|
| 2:59:29| And the drug came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10769)|
| 2:59:30| Then what were you going to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| You were going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| How were you going to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| Were you going to bring in the equipment that was necessary to really make it an orthopedic hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| and a burns hospital and a chest disease hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| I mean, a spinal injury hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10784)|
| 2:59:51| I served on the committees and went through the process of totally redoing the shriners' hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10791)|
| 2:59:58| And they're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10798)|
| 3:00:00| How could we make these greater than what they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| If they need to be greater, then I think you need to have the medical profession to give some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10804)|
| 3:00:12| as to what procedure you ought to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| And then those of you who are interested in it need and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10816)|
| 3:00:23| and look at it and read the books and the material that's available to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| as to what's going on in the medical field today and what's going on in the nursing field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| and where does the money come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| Mr. Chairman, I'm willing to defer any other comments I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| because I don't have any more questions here to anyone that wants to talk to him while he's at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| I really didn't have any specific questions for Judge Bozeman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| except to say that I'm an admirer of yours, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10852)|
| 3:00:55| As a young journalist, I covered the old county court meetings and I observed you many times running those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10855)|
| 3:01:01| You had a lot of interesting people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10861)|
| 3:01:02| Those were the days that Kaz Walker would come by and Mildred Doyle was the school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10862)|
| 3:01:06| And you had Willard Yarbrough and Mary Lou and a group of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10866)|
| 3:01:10| So I just want to say I'm an admirer of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| But I do have some questions, but not specifically for Judge Bozeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| Commissioner Pinkston, did you have any questions for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10875)|
| 3:01:18| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10878)|
| 3:01:19| Well, thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10879)|
| 3:01:20| I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10880)|
| 3:01:21| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| And I'm available to you if you ever need me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10882)|
| 3:01:34| That's a first district resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10894)|
| 3:01:41| Do we have someone else that wants to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| Did you have some questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| Go ahead, Commissioner Pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| Mr. Law Director, can we legally sell this property without a market analysis on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10912)|
| 3:01:59| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10919)|
| 3:02:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| I've got a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| I think under the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10923)|
| 3:02:04| Well, as this issue has developed and other purchasers or interested third parties have emerged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10924)|
| 3:02:15| I think that's changed the dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| Initially, when this issue first came to the fore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10938)|
| 3:02:24| the sole issue before the commission was whether or not to sell the property to Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10944)|
| 3:02:32| and to make a business judgment and a policy decision as to whether the terms were acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| So the resolution that was drafted for your review called on this commission to declare it surplus property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10959)|
| 3:02:48| and to say that the sale was not to sell it through the competitive bidding process was not practicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10968)|
| 3:02:58| because in our procurement code there is a vehicle to sell real property through a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10978)|
| 3:03:09| If to do otherwise is not practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10989)|
| 3:03:13| Now, however, I don't know how, whether any of these other purchasers who have stepped forward are how interested, how serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=10993)|
| 3:03:24| but there is at least discussion and representatives have appeared before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11004)|
| 3:03:29| So to answer your specific question about a market analysis, yes, you should have a market analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11009)|
| 3:03:36| and there should also be an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| Now, you're talking about a certified appraisal instead of property assessor's appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11023)|
| 3:03:45| The language of the ordinance says that there should be an appraisal done within a 12-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11025)|
| 3:03:53| So within the last 12 months, or if not one, within the last 12 months, then now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11033)|
| 3:04:02| There should be an appraisal performed by a certified appraiser is the language in the procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11042)|
| 3:04:11| And that appraisal should be submitted to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11051)|
| 3:04:17| And now there's no requirement that you sell it for that appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| The code simply provides that you have that at your disposal so that you can look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11064)|
| 3:04:31| and then make a policy decision based on what you think best should be done under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11071)|
| 3:04:38| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11078)|
| 3:04:41| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11081)|
| 3:04:42| I'm sorry, the market analysis is required if you are going to proceed through a negotiated sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11082)|
| 3:04:52| and not put it out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| If you're going to put it out for a bid, then a market analysis is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11095)|
| 3:05:01| But now it's out for sale, so it's not a bid really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11101)|
| 3:05:05| We need a market analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11105)|
| 3:05:06| Let me ask you another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11106)|
| 3:05:07| You're the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| Would you say the disagreement we've had with Hillcrest was a contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11110)|
| 3:05:21| Yes, it's a lease contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| It's a lease contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| Did they get paid for everything they did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11125)|
| 3:05:34| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11134)|
| 3:05:35| Okay, I'll get Ms. Poynter up here then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| I'll get Ms. Poynter or whoever wants to represent Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| Under the terms of the lease, the county owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11141)|
| 3:05:44| We lease the property to them for a dollar a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| And under the most current leases in the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11147)|
| 3:05:52| Hillcrest was solely responsible for the maintenance of the buildings, upkeep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11152)|
| 3:05:59| That was not the county's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| We simply were the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| Hillcrest was the tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11165)|
| 3:06:06| and Hillcrest had to pay for capital improvements, maintenance, operations, all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11166)|
| 3:06:15| Okay, but you would say the patients did pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11175)|
| 3:06:19| Of course, you haven't seen their books, so you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11179)|
| 3:06:20| So I need to talk to someone from Hillcrest who wants to represent Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11180)|
| 3:06:26| I'll try to get you answers, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11188)|
| 3:06:34| Arthur, let me ask you, this is a nonprofit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11194)|
| 3:06:39| I want everybody to realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11199)|
| 3:06:41| 501C3, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11201)|
| 3:06:42| But a 501C3 can make a profit, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| It has to be used for charitable purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11208)|
| 3:06:49| It does not distribute any excess funds to owners, stockholders, or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| It has to be plowed back into the mission of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11214)|
| 3:06:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| That's correct, but they can make a profit, but it has to be used for their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| Well, it's not a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| Well, it has to be put back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| The reason why I'm saying this, they've had a fund balance for about $28 million consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11225)|
| 3:07:09| up until the last few years of savings of $13 million and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11229)|
| 3:07:15| But what I want to ask you is, Arthur, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| Now, you're going to speak for Hillcrest, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| I'm going to speak or try to get you the information for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| Information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11245)|
| 3:07:26| I don't have all the answers, but I'll try to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11246)|
| 3:07:29| I don't know who was responsible for this ad here in Sunday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11249)|
| 3:07:35| I don't know whether this was paid for or donated by the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| But in this ad right here, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| Hillcrest has paid for maintenance of the county-owned facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11264)|
| 3:07:48| investing approximately $6 million in improvements over the past 10 years alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11268)|
| 3:07:55| Now, Arthur, when I asked for the $6 million that they'd spent out there, what it had been spent on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11275)|
| 3:08:01| they gave it to me, and this is for 34 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11281)|
| 3:08:05| It's for 34 years, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| And their things in here are not spent on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11287)|
| 3:08:12| It's normal operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| Yarren Oil Company, $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| Phone system, $123.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| Miscellaneous, $98,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| Miscellaneous, $49,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| O'Reilly's auto parts, $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| There's all kinds of things in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| And this goes back for 34 years, and it still just totals $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| I can probably respond to a couple of items you've raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| I assume they're vans for patient transport to and from doctors, offices, hospitals, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11316)|
| 3:08:44| Maintenance of those vans is a necessary expense for the operation of these three facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11324)|
| 3:08:49| But that's not spending it on these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11329)|
| 3:08:51| That's on their own equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| It's the operation of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| It's operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11335)|
| 3:08:56| Am I finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11336)|
| 3:08:57| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| It sounds like they're also heating the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| If they didn't heat them, they would deteriorate pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| If they didn't cool them, they would deteriorate pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11343)|
| 3:09:08| I'll try to get some help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11348)|
| 3:09:14| I did not prepare that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11356)|
| 3:09:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| Specific items, I'm going to let the finance people talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11388)|
| 3:09:53| My name is Danny Higginbotham, and I live at 124 Huntington Drive, and I'm the controller at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11393)|
| 3:10:02| I've been there a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| And what this list is, of course, Commissioner Pinkston has a list that has the names of the vendors that were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11404)|
| 3:10:12| But what the list is is capital items, in other words, things that get capitalized and depreciated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11412)|
| 3:10:19| not operating expense items that are used in daily operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11419)|
| 3:10:28| And so when you have a list of vendors, sometimes it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11428)|
| 3:10:33| If you have a building project and you do improvements, it's not going to say boilers on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11433)|
| 3:10:40| It's going to have the name of the vendor that was paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11440)|
| 3:10:45| Mr. Higginbotham, the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11445)|
| 3:10:51| Tennessee Department of Health, Knox County County Court Clerk's Office, Tennessee Department of Finance, State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11451)|
| 3:11:01| you've got the workforce down here several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| Would that not be considered normal operating expenses for licensing and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| Well, if it's permits for buildings and things like that where you have building projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11469)|
| 3:11:13| then it would be part of the building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| What would the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| Would that be workers' compensation or unemployment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11478)|
| 3:11:23| I don't know specifically without looking at the invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11483)|
| 3:11:27| And a lot of this happened before I got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11487)|
| 3:11:29| but it was classified as part of some of the development building costs for various projects that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11489)|
| 3:11:37| How long have you been there, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11499)|
| 3:11:40| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11500)|
| 3:11:41| Do you realize that this list that I've got, that they said they spent this money in ten years and it goes back to 1974?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11501)|
| 3:11:51| This $6 million total goes all the way back to 1974?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11511)|
| 3:12:03| There are a few items on here that are that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11523)|
| 3:12:07| I believe if you'll look and see, sir, most of these items that are on here, 74, 81, 76, 77, 91, 92, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11527)|
| 3:12:15| about 90 percent of them are further back than ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11535)|
| 3:12:24| I don't know if it's 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11544)|
| 3:12:26| Well, it's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11546)|
| 3:12:27| Let me ask you this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11547)|
| 3:12:30| You've got here on the end of this $2,203,000 depreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11550)|
| 3:12:40| $2,203,000, $158.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11560)|
| 3:12:45| Is that correct on depreciation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11565)|
| 3:12:48| Well, now, sir, does not the state reimburse you that money through your bed rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11568)|
| 3:12:57| That's a complicated question, but basically what the Medicaid, the way that works is that we do a cost report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| they take our costs, they take the cost per day, they apply a state average, they run that into a state average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11584)|
| 3:13:13| they have caps on it, and then they determine how much per day to pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11593)|
| 3:13:18| So all our expenses are included in that cost report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11598)|
| 3:13:23| but whether or not they actually affect our daily payment rate is you'd have to analyze the cost report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11603)|
| 3:13:30| to see if it had any real effect on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| The payment rates in Tennessee right now are around $150 a day, and if our expenses went way up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11613)|
| 3:13:41| it wouldn't affect that rate very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| If it went way down, it would still be around the $150 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11624)|
| 3:13:49| But do they not raise it when you have a depreciation on the equipment that you've bought for that home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11629)|
| 3:13:55| you get a higher rate, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| It could go up a dollar or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| A day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11640)|
| 3:14:01| Okay, a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11641)|
| 3:14:02| You take 560 beds and you've got quite a bit of this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11642)|
| 3:14:06| You've approximately got $2,203,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11646)|
| 3:14:10| There's another article in here, statement in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11650)|
| 3:14:14| that more than 70% of Hillcrest residents are covered by Medicaid funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11654)|
| 3:14:20| which pays Hillcrest $205 less per resident per pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11666)|
| 3:14:27| That's true in most nursing homes, isn't it, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| If you're there for pay, you have to pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11669)|
| 3:14:33| The difference is not necessarily because for the reason that you insinuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11673)|
| 3:14:40| The difference is because we also have patients that come under Medicare skilled nursing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| which is a lot higher skill rate, higher level of care, and we get more payment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11684)|
| 3:14:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11692)|
| 3:14:53| So if we reduced our Medicaid from 70% and replaced it with Medicare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11693)|
| 3:15:01| we'd generate a whole lot more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| But our mission is to take care of Medicaid, so that's what we do, even though we lose money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11704)|
| 3:15:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11711)|
| 3:15:12| I believe that according to the Litton Law, that's true for every nursing home, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11712)|
| 3:15:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11716)|
| 3:15:17| They have to take in a Medicaid patient over someone who has money if the Medicaid patient applies first, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11717)|
| 3:15:21| No, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11721)|
| 3:15:22| They don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11722)|
| 3:15:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11723)|
| 3:15:24| Okay, we'll hear some more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| We've got some people who want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11725)|
| 3:15:29| You know, I'm just concerned about this 48% national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11729)|
| 3:15:35| I mean the state of Tennessee average for Medicaid patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11735)|
| 3:15:43| Yeah, well, we're concerned about that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| because we are the ones that end up taking all the patients that the other facilities won't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11746)|
| 3:15:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11752)|
| 3:15:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| But you're saying the statewide rate is only 48%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11755)|
| 3:16:08| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11768)|
| 3:16:09| That's pretty close, I'd say, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| Would you believe it's 66%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11771)|
| 3:16:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11774)|
| 3:16:15| You wouldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| The west facility is a FFF facility, is it not correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11779)|
| 3:16:26| I'm not sure what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11786)|
| 3:16:39| SFF is a special focus facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11799)|
| 3:16:44| This nursing home has a record of persistently poor survey performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11804)|
| 3:16:49| and has been selected for more frequent inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| and monitoring to learn more, visit, you know, where it's got to go at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11812)|
| 3:17:00| Yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| And we are addressing those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11823)|
| 3:17:07| But just to elaborate on that a little bit, there's two things going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11827)|
| 3:17:12| one at the federal level, and if you all heard a while back on the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11832)|
| 3:17:17| over 90% of the nursing homes in the United States are out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11837)|
| 3:17:22| and part of that is because the compliance standards are not being applied correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11842)|
| 3:17:29| And one of the problems we had at West with the review had to do with an ADA violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11849)|
| 3:17:36| Americans with Disabilities, a ramp that was improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11856)|
| 3:17:40| and that ramp has been there since the building was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| I'm talking about health deficiency, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| That is part of the deficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11866)|
| 3:17:47| That was what was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| Pardon me about interrupting you, but this was taken 5-22-2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11869)|
| 3:17:57| You've got seven number fours out of the 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11877)|
| 3:18:04| Out of those 25 right there, number four are immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11884)|
| 3:18:16| The north has 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11896)|
| 3:18:20| The average in the state of Tennessee is seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11900)|
| 3:18:24| The average in the United States is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11904)|
| 3:18:30| Oh, you're going to let Ms. Poynter talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11912)|
| 3:18:33| It is nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11913)|
| 3:18:34| Now, I'm not saying these cannot be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| What I'm saying is, and I think Hillcrest has done a good job for the years, but they've got paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| They've got paid in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| Our job is to look out for the benefit of the Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11925)|
| 3:18:49| not only the ones in the health care thing in Hillcrest, but the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11929)|
| 3:18:55| My thinking is on this, that this should go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11935)|
| 3:18:59| We should come up with standards that we're wanting the law department to write up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11939)|
| 3:19:04| to what we expect to be done for our indigent care and put this out for an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11944)|
| 3:19:13| and let Hillcrest bid on it or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11953)|
| 3:19:16| But we've got to take care of both people, the indigent care and the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11956)|
| 3:19:22| Now, this came out, and no one knew anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11962)|
| 3:19:26| And to the newspaper, I didn't find out about it or no commissioner up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| until last month at the agenda meeting when we had our agenda and got it for the finance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11969)|
| 3:19:35| This came out, and since then there's been two firms that have contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11975)|
| 3:19:41| They're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| There's another one in Virginia that's found out about it that are interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| It is our job as commissioners to try to get the best deal for the health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11986)|
| 3:19:52| the indigent care, and the citizens of Knoxville that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11992)|
| 3:19:58| Now, I'm not trying to be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| You may get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12000)|
| 3:20:01| If we put these stipulations on it, Hillcrest may get it for less than $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12001)|
| 3:20:06| But we just need some things done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| But I really feel like that this was a backdoor deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12008)|
| 3:20:13| Nobody knew about it until it come up at the finance committee first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12013)|
| 3:20:18| and then our governmental info commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| Nobody knew about the fines, everything we're in under, and it was just we got a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12020)|
| 3:20:27| and I can't even find out who in Knox County approached Hillcrest about buying this and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12027)|
| 3:20:34| Now, I talked to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| He told me, and just like he told everyone here, he drew up this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12041)|
| 3:20:44| My office drafted the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| Who came up to you and asked you to draft this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12047)|
| 3:20:51| I spoke, I believe I was first contacted by Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12051)|
| 3:20:55| I met with Mr. Troyer, and as a result of my meeting with Mr. Troyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12055)|
| 3:21:03| we looked at the law, the county ordinances, and we drafted the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12063)|
| 3:21:10| I'm not saying you did anything wrong, Mr. Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| but what I'm saying is Mr. Troyer doesn't remember who asked him to get this resolution drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12073)|
| 3:21:21| All I know is I've asked him several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12081)|
| 3:21:24| Well, you know, when we discussed the issue, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12084)|
| 3:21:29| I didn't see and still don't see any nefarious goings-on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12089)|
| 3:21:35| It was a straight business deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12095)|
| 3:21:40| and we were asked to draw up a resolution that could be presented to this body to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12100)|
| 3:21:48| And, you know, whether this body approves it or not was not our issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12108)|
| 3:21:53| It was simply this is the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| We drafted a resolution to reflect that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12117)|
| 3:22:00| It was placed on the agenda, and it's been, you know, discussed and debated here as it continues to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12120)|
| 3:22:06| You've done your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12126)|
| 3:22:07| I'm going to commend you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12127)|
| 3:22:08| You did what you were asked to, but I'd just like to know whose idea it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12128)|
| 3:22:11| Commissioner Pinkston, I think the mayor wants to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12134)|
| 3:22:15| Well, first of all, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12137)|
| 3:22:18| I want to give my appreciation to Judge Bozeman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12138)|
| 3:22:21| I value his service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| He is a wealth of knowledge, and he's done a lot of things that our community still benefits from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| So, Your Honor, if you're still here, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12147)|
| 3:22:35| Secondly, we have some people who have been sitting here for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| They are the men and women who take care of people in our community who need it and support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12159)|
| 3:22:44| If you'd please stand, I'd like to thank the people at Hillcrest for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12164)|
| 3:22:47| Let's be very blunt about this, and let's cut right to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12167)|
| 3:23:02| You can sit up here and you can yammer all day long about why this is a bad deal or who brought it up or who didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12182)|
| 3:23:08| It doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12188)|
| 3:23:09| We're doing business out here in public, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12189)|
| 3:23:13| Right here in the light of day, we're doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12193)|
| 3:23:17| And we're doing it for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| Because we care about the senior citizens in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12199)|
| 3:23:22| That's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12202)|
| 3:23:24| Senator Burchett stood here in front of you today and he made a very good statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12204)|
| 3:23:27| I hope everybody paid attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| He said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| He said, thanks for your investment in the Veterans Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| What did we get for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12214)|
| 3:23:35| Did we own the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12215)|
| 3:23:36| Not one brick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12216)|
| 3:23:38| Not a single one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| Is it a good investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| You're darn right it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12221)|
| 3:23:42| It's a really good investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| It's a good investment because we said that we weren't going to allow our seniors to be overlooked, forgotten, or left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12224)|
| 3:23:50| And we're trying to do just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12230)|
| 3:23:52| So here's the situation Hillcrest finds itself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12232)|
| 3:23:55| They make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| You can go through a bunch of laundry lists and try and get nitpicky, or you can go out and look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12237)|
| 3:24:02| They're pretty apparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12242)|
| 3:24:04| These are high-use facilities that require constant maintenance and constant upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12244)|
| 3:24:08| What they need to do is to be able to bar against those, as Dr. Briggs mentioned, as collateral so they can make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12248)|
| 3:24:15| That's the key thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12255)|
| 3:24:23| Our population is aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| We need to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| This is a great way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| We invest lots of money in taking care of those who can't take care of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12269)|
| 3:24:34| $5.2 million every year in indigent care we allocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12274)|
| 3:24:38| Good expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12278)|
| 3:24:40| Those people who go without health care, in most cases we couldn't get that, or at least lesser type health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12280)|
| 3:24:45| We've invested in nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| We've invested in senior centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| These are really good investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| This is just one more type of those good investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12291)|
| 3:24:55| Let me make something else clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| This administration won't benefit from any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| The way this is staggered out, the payments come later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12299)|
| 3:25:02| This isn't about the payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12302)|
| 3:25:04| This is about taking care of those who use their resources to build the roads, build the schools, put together the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12304)|
| 3:25:13| the wisdom that made this community where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| Now they're in their tender years, their golden years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| And personally, I'd like somebody in town that we know to take care of them and not farm it out to some other place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12318)|
| 3:25:32| Mr. Locke is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12332)|
| 3:25:33| Nothing nefarious has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| It's been all above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12336)|
| 3:25:37| We're doing business right out here in the public in the light of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12337)|
| 3:25:40| Look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12340)|
| 3:25:41| Scrutinize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12341)|
| 3:25:42| But when you begin to think about money, I hope you'll take one other thought first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12342)|
| 3:25:48| Go by there, if you haven't been, and look at the faces of the men and women who live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12348)|
| 3:25:53| and their families who are pleased with what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| and the health care professionals who take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| And then, if you've got wisdom and you've got a heart, you'll decide this is a great deal for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12359)|
| 3:26:05| and, most importantly, for its senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12367)|
| 3:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12378)|
| 3:26:21| Ms. Poynter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12381)|
| 3:26:25| Who paid for the last two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| Who paid for the addition on the west facility and the addition on the north facility here just not too long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12387)|
| 3:26:34| I believe in 89, wasn't it, out north somewhere right along in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12394)|
| 3:26:38| I think it was completed in 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12398)|
| 3:26:40| Ninety-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12400)|
| 3:26:41| Who paid for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| I think the county issued bonds for that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| Now, I'm not saying that these people shouldn't have health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12405)|
| 3:26:50| I just want them to get the best they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12410)|
| 3:26:52| and the citizens and taxpayers in Knox County to get the best deal they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12412)|
| 3:26:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12415)|
| 3:26:56| I asked for a CPA report from you showing that Hillcrest is financially strong enough to buy this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12416)|
| 3:27:03| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12423)|
| 3:27:04| I asked for a report at the last meeting for you to have me a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12424)|
| 3:27:12| a signed-off report from a CPA saying that you were financially able to buy this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| I don't recall that request, but I'd be happy to provide you our last complete audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| Because with the terms of this, now, I heard that the people here came up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12442)|
| 3:27:29| and Mr. Seymour was one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12449)|
| 3:27:32| that said the only way you could buy this would be the interest for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12452)|
| 3:27:36| Now, I don't know if you can't make payments on it, nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12456)|
| 3:27:39| but the interest next year will be $60,000 to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| I don't know how you can afford to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| I just really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| We're working diligently and faithfully to become more financially strong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12467)|
| 3:27:52| and we have faith with these good folks' help that we're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12472)|
| 3:27:56| and we're going to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12476)|
| 3:27:57| and we're going to be positioned financially viable to be able to expand our aging services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12477)|
| 3:28:03| But you will agree that the papers you give me go back to 1974,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12483)|
| 3:28:09| and a lot of that is just normal operating expense for any business you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12489)|
| 3:28:15| I will say that there are some dates on here from those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12495)|
| 3:28:18| The one you referred to was $250, so I don't think we ought to haggle about that personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| I didn't say one $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| Which one is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| Probably one of the Tennessee Department of Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12510)|
| 3:28:31| If you follow that up, you know, it's like they always say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| you watch your pennies and the dollars will watch themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12515)|
| 3:28:36| But anyway, I think we have some more people who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| I'll turn the floor over to anyone else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12518)|
| 3:28:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12521)|
| 3:28:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12522)|
| 3:28:43| If you'll stay, a couple of questions here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12523)|
| 3:28:46| How many employees, first of all, how long has Hillcrest been in business in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12526)|
| 3:28:51| About 48 years, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12531)|
| 3:28:52| So that would be, what, 1960?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12532)|
| 3:28:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12534)|
| 3:28:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12535)|
| 3:28:56| How many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12536)|
| 3:28:57| We have about 650, 670.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| Let's say, for example, this were to go out to bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12540)|
| 3:29:03| and someone were to come in and purchase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| What happens to those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| Well, let me first say thank you for asking the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12548)|
| 3:29:11| because what the county owns, as you all know, are property and buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12551)|
| 3:29:16| Hillcrest Health Care Communities owns the nursing home business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12556)|
| 3:29:20| and Hillcrest Health Care Communities is not for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12560)|
| 3:29:24| So I'm going to ask that we don't need any more outbursts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12564)|
| 3:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12576)|
| 3:29:38| So what would happen would be that either Hillcrest Health Care would look for a new landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12578)|
| 3:29:43| and try to move our 500-plus patients and our employees with us to a new site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12583)|
| 3:29:50| and continue to do what we try to do every day now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| or we would be forced to sell if we couldn't find a new landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12593)|
| 3:29:58| We would be forced to sell to whatever company you all sold the property to, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| And if that were a for-profit company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| you'd be trading your not-for-profit long-term homegrown company to that entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12606)|
| 3:30:12| So I want to make sure that I understand that with the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| if someone were to come in and purchase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| you would have the option of moving and doing something else or going somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12618)|
| 3:30:22| If you couldn't do that, there's no guarantee that a new company would come in and keep these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12622)|
| 3:30:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12627)|
| 3:30:28| The new company would have to barter with those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| Look, if I may supplement that, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12631)|
| 3:30:34| typically when a business is acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12634)|
| 3:30:39| the employees have to resign on the date of the acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| and reapply with the new employer for their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| And the new employer can take some, all, or none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12647)|
| 3:30:52| And as far as with the patients themselves, you had mentioned perhaps, you know, moving those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12652)|
| 3:30:58| If the new company were to come in, are they under any obligation to take those patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12658)|
| 3:31:02| They are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12662)|
| 3:31:03| So, in other words, they could come in and scrutinize to see perhaps, I hate to say this, who could pay, who couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12663)|
| 3:31:10| I mean, you know, again, I've been through mergers and acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12670)|
| 3:31:13| I understand a little bit how these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12673)|
| 3:31:15| I'm not in the health care business, so that's why I'm asking these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12675)|
| 3:31:18| What is your budget, your annual budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12678)|
| 3:31:20| About $35 million to $36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12680)|
| 3:31:22| And over the course of the time, you have not come to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12682)|
| 3:31:26| and you haven't said to Knox County, hey, we need a new air conditioning system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12686)|
| 3:31:31| You've used your funds to purchase those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12691)|
| 3:31:36| That's why we have this $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12696)|
| 3:31:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| Since 2002, the lease has been very clearly written that we were responsible for those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12699)|
| 3:31:51| If we do nothing, let's say that we decide we don't want to put it up for bid, we don't want to sell it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12711)|
| 3:31:57| If we do nothing and you just continue on what you're doing, can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| I mean, what are the ramifications of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12722)|
| 3:32:05| My first response is that we need to take a good hard look at that lease because it's pretty unmanageable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12725)|
| 3:32:10| and it's a lease that we would not enter again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12730)|
| 3:32:13| It's very restrictive in a number of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| and it does not allow us to make business decisions like a health care entity in today's world needs to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12735)|
| 3:32:25| What are some of the specific needs that you need at your facilities now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12745)|
| 3:32:29| I mean, in other words, you want to go to the bank, you want to be able to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12749)|
| 3:32:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12753)|
| 3:32:34| First of all, a very simple example is the building that was referred to earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12754)|
| 3:32:41| that was the original TV hospital, serves currently as our corporate building and houses no residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12761)|
| 3:32:46| We have two floors of space there that we would love to be able to sublease for a new revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12766)|
| 3:32:51| to perhaps some of our health care partners, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12771)|
| 3:32:54| And under the current lease with the county, we are unable to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12774)|
| 3:32:58| So that is one simple example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| We've talked about the greenhouses and trying to provide the current population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12782)|
| 3:33:06| that we now serve a new environment of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| If we owned land, we would be much more likely to be able to enter a capital campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12789)|
| 3:33:15| for private funding around building greenhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12795)|
| 3:33:19| and that is the model that most people across the nation have been successful in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12799)|
| 3:33:24| So that would be another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12804)|
| 3:33:26| Without owning the land, as you can imagine, it's very difficult to begin a capital campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12806)|
| 3:33:33| I guess my final statement is this, that I'm concerned about putting it up for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12813)|
| 3:33:37| And the reason I'm concerned about putting it up for bid is I believe we've got some folks that have been here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12817)|
| 3:33:41| for almost 50 years and you've served this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12821)|
| 3:33:45| I'm also concerned that if an out-of-town group comes in that is a for profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12825)|
| 3:33:50| I want an organization that puts people over profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| And so that concerns me that we would do that because, as you stated earlier, under a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| any profits that you get go back into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12840)|
| 3:34:03| Whereas if you are a for profit, depending on how the company is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12843)|
| 3:34:07| you're looking at maybe some stockholders, some other people, bonuses, all those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12847)|
| 3:34:13| And so dealing with, you know, and Judge Bozeman, I think, made a very, very good statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12853)|
| 3:34:18| We are responsible for looking after these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| I mean, if we don't, who is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| And I know we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| We're taking that responsibility seriously by discussing this and debating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| But I'm leery about putting this up for bid for that very reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12869)|
| 3:34:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12876)|
| 3:34:38| Yes, I want to make some just general comments on this to put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12878)|
| 3:34:43| And I think that this commission has several priorities that we have to look at in considering the sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12883)|
| 3:34:49| Is that, one, just as Commissioner Hammond mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| we need to protect the poor and the Medicaid patients of this county so they indeed have a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12892)|
| 3:34:58| Secondly, we need to exercise our fiscal responsibility on behalf of the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12898)|
| 3:35:04| because ultimately this isn't the commission's or the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12904)|
| 3:35:07| This is the taxpayer's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| And we have a certain stewardship and responsibility to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| And then just these fine people that we have out here, we also have an obligation to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12915)|
| 3:35:20| I had down here 670 Hillcrest employees as far as their employment and the good care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12920)|
| 3:35:25| and showing them our appreciation for the care that they've given for these patients over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12925)|
| 3:35:30| And as anyone who's ever been in the nursing home, it's very different than taking care of patients in a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12930)|
| 3:35:36| And I can tell you as a physician, I appreciate very much that the care that you give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12936)|
| 3:35:40| because it's very difficult to take care of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12940)|
| 3:35:43| and you don't always receive the same appreciation that you do on the acute care patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| Thirdly, we have to be sure that the sale is done legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12949)|
| 3:35:54| that we meet both the federal and state regulations on transferring this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12954)|
| 3:35:59| And just as Judge Bozeman mentioned, this formerly was the state of Tennessee land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12959)|
| 3:36:05| There's been a series of transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| And I want to be certain that we do it legally, and I'm sure that our law director is looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12967)|
| 3:36:12| One of the comments that I would like to make is that the health care business is different than other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12972)|
| 3:36:17| And when we talk about some of these fines and problems and regulations and inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12977)|
| 3:36:22| these things are up to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12982)|
| 3:36:24| And just because there's been an accusation made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12984)|
| 3:36:27| it doesn't necessarily mean that there's bad care being given out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12987)|
| 3:36:30| And as you mentioned, there's these little things like ramps and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12990)|
| 3:36:33| And so I think these are things that we all agree that need to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12993)|
| 3:36:37| and I'm sure they are being corrected, but I don't think that we need to take them seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=12997)|
| 3:36:43| But those aren't, as we would say in the military, they're not war stoppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13003)|
| 3:36:47| These are things that will be corrected, and very well some of these fines can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| And I've seen that happen again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13011)|
| 3:36:55| On the other hand, we've talked a lot about the county's responsibility for the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13015)|
| 3:37:01| And I mentioned this just a little bit earlier, is things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13021)|
| 3:37:05| Things have changed from the 1940s and 50s when there were no federal programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13025)|
| 3:37:10| or state programs for the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| and the county had to do the best they could to take care for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| Even since the Hillcrest Health Care Community's organizations took over 48 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13035)|
| 3:37:22| we've had new programs such as the Medicare program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| which probably makes up a small portion of your patients because that's really limited to 20 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13045)|
| 3:37:30| and sometimes 100 days, and there's a co-pay after 20 days, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13050)|
| 3:37:34| And also the partnership that you have between the state and the federal government with Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13054)|
| 3:37:40| So I think that the role that a county such as Knox County has changed from what it was in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13060)|
| 3:37:47| And I think what was good for the county and good for the poor 50, 60, 70 years ago is a little bit different today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13067)|
| 3:37:57| I think that one of the things in this deliberation that we also have to take into consideration are some of the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13077)|
| 3:38:03| And we may hear more about that, is that sometimes, and I'm not exactly clear on these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13083)|
| 3:38:10| and we may need to look into this further, is that there's laws on how you can turn patients away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13090)|
| 3:38:15| if you're receiving Medicare, Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13095)|
| 3:38:18| You just can't put some of those patients on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13098)|
| 3:38:21| You can't accept some and not accept some, and I'm not sure what those rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13101)|
| 3:38:25| And I have also a series of questions, and this may or may not be the time to ask some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13105)|
| 3:38:31| that deals with the certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| I just recently went through this process back in July, and it is a complex process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13113)|
| 3:38:39| You have to go through the Health Services and Developmental Agency in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13119)|
| 3:38:43| It's a board of ten members, and if you've been through these things before, it is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13123)|
| 3:38:48| But also how those certificates are transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13128)|
| 3:38:51| And if you pick up and leave and open a facility elsewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13131)|
| 3:38:56| it can make it very difficult for someone else to come in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13136)|
| 3:38:59| because you have to go back on the basis of community need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| And I have a lot of questions just about how that certificate could be transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13142)|
| 3:39:06| if you did do that, if you didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| If you move beds from the present fiscal Hillcrest facility, let's say you move it down the road ten miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13149)|
| 3:39:16| there's issues about whether that certificate is valid or not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| And we recently went through this in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| And like I said, the health care business is different from other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13163)|
| 3:39:27| One of the things that I think that we need to decide tonight is whether we're going to try to make this decision tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13167)|
| 3:39:34| or whether we want to get an appraisal, not get an appraisal on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13174)|
| 3:39:39| whether we want to have a workshop to go over all of these questions that are specific to the health care industry or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13179)|
| 3:39:46| And then just as a final comment, we've talked a lot about some of the finances involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13186)|
| 3:39:51| And because Hillcrest is a 501c3 organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13191)|
| 3:39:56| they would pay no property taxes or taxes to the county if this deal went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13196)|
| 3:40:02| because it would not change that federal designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13202)|
| 3:40:06| And, for instance, I'm just going to throw a figure out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13206)|
| 3:40:10| Let's say we sold the property for $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13210)|
| 3:40:13| We would receive, and it's to a for-profit company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13213)|
| 3:40:17| the county would receive about $215,000 a year in property taxes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13217)|
| 3:40:25| Also, if the money was given up front over the course of 30 years, the county would receive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13225)|
| 3:40:32| and let's say we took that $20 million and just invested it in a 30-year certificate at 3.5%, we'd get about $21 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13232)|
| 3:40:41| You take those taxes over 30 years, it's $6.46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13241)|
| 3:40:46| So we're talking about a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13246)|
| 3:40:49| We have to be certain that in exercising our fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Knox County that we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13249)|
| 3:40:58| and if you add this all together, the $10 million over 30 years, it turns out to be about $47.46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13258)|
| 3:41:05| And that is a very low estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13265)|
| 3:41:07| We're talking about a $37 to $40 million difference over 30 years to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13267)|
| 3:41:14| Are you saying they'd be paying $37 to $40 million more than Hillcrest over it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13274)|
| 3:41:21| And that's a very conservative estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13281)|
| 3:41:23| That's assuming the property has no appreciation over 30 years, and that includes the tax base doesn't increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13283)|
| 3:41:30| And I'm not including things like this is purely on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| It doesn't include any of the other furnishings that go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13294)|
| 3:41:38| And I think we have to decide if the goodwill that I think really that Hillcrest has, is it worth $40 million to the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13298)|
| 3:41:49| One other final word, because I really have a lot of, I guess you'd call it compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13309)|
| 3:41:57| or concern about the employees, and I know they would be concerned if this went to a for-profit agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13317)|
| 3:42:03| Don't underestimate your skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| Someone cannot come into this community and replace 670 of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13326)|
| 3:42:11| The hospitals need medical personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| The other people need medical personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13333)|
| 3:42:16| There may be some changes, particularly if you're on the administrative staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| but I think most of the actual, it's what I call the rubber meets the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13339)|
| 3:42:23| is that the people who are taking care of the patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13343)|
| 3:42:26| I don't think you'd have any trouble finding a job with a new organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13346)|
| 3:42:30| And I think they would be looking for you more than you would be looking to them for a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13350)|
| 3:42:35| because your skills are such that there's not very many of those around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13355)|
| 3:42:40| And I'll stop it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13360)|
| 3:42:42| And, again, I think that I don't know if we need to have a special workshop on this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13362)|
| 3:42:46| but I'll stop right here and let someone else speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| Commissioner Leuvel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13369)|
| 3:42:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13370)|
| 3:42:54| Mr. Law Director, last month and then again at intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13374)|
| 3:42:59| asked if we had worked out the details of the deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13379)|
| 3:43:02| Have we done that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13382)|
| 3:43:04| We have sent language to Mr. Seymour that my office proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13384)|
| 3:43:10| and we had some further negotiations this morning, discussions, really, about how to affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13390)|
| 3:43:19| Basically where we are as of today is that what I proposed was a restrictive covenant that would be permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13399)|
| 3:43:30| It's not limited to any period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| So if the property were transferred, whoever the transferee would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13412)|
| 3:43:39| whether it be Hillcrest or some third party, would be charged with providing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13419)|
| 3:43:46| always providing a majority of its care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13426)|
| 3:43:50| And I threw that majority in arbitrarily, subject to whatever this commission deemed was best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13430)|
| 3:43:57| But that's the way it was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| A majority would be devoted to indigent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13439)|
| 3:44:04| There are three separate definitions of indigent in that restrictive covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13444)|
| 3:44:09| And if an individual met any one of the three, then they would be eligible for care at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13449)|
| 3:44:21| The county would have the right, but not the duty, to audit on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13461)|
| 3:44:31| to ensure that a majority of the patient population met the definitions of indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13471)|
| 3:44:40| And in the event, at any one of the three facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13480)|
| 3:44:45| if it ever fell below a majority of those definitions of indigent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13485)|
| 3:44:53| then all three would revert back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13493)|
| 3:44:59| And that's the way it was submitted to Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13499)|
| 3:45:05| The discussions that I had with Mr. Seymour and Hillcrest's attorney this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13505)|
| 3:45:10| centered around some perhaps modifications over the definition of a nursing home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13510)|
| 3:45:18| because the definition that we used in the restrictive covenant was a statutory definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13518)|
| 3:45:26| And we might need to make that broader because that statutory definition could be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13526)|
| 3:45:31| by the legislature at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| We'd want to have a definition that would be the fallback definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13533)|
| 3:45:38| if the statutory definition were ever changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13538)|
| 3:45:41| And we might be amenable to modifying the three definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13541)|
| 3:45:48| or slightly changing one of the definitions of what constitutes indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13548)|
| 3:45:56| But generally, the way we drafted it, whoever gets it is going to always have the responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13556)|
| 3:46:05| to serve a majority of indigent patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13565)|
| 3:46:10| And if they ever stop doing that at any one of the three facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13570)|
| 3:46:15| title to all three comes back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| And there's also a mechanism in there for Knox County to go in, if it so chooses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| and perform an audit to make sure that that's the way it's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13584)|
| 3:46:29| But as of this time, we do not have an agreement between both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13589)|
| 3:46:38| They've not agreed to your terms and we've not agreed to theirs as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13598)|
| 3:46:42| Well, they don't have terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13602)|
| 3:46:44| I submitted this to them and said this is what the commission says it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| And they've not agreed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13608)|
| 3:46:50| They have asked for some what I consider to be minor adjustments in the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13610)|
| 3:46:56| but I haven't seen the language yet because, like I said, we only had these discussions this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13616)|
| 3:47:01| I don't think we're far away from what I consider would be an agreement that protects Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13621)|
| 3:47:10| as per what this commission has expressed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13630)|
| 3:47:14| If the commission tells me or charges me tonight with something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13634)|
| 3:47:21| then I will certainly communicate that to Mr. Seymour and tell him that it has to be differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13641)|
| 3:47:28| But what I'm telling you is what I've sent them, and Mr. Seymour can address their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13648)|
| 3:47:35| Well, what you've said so far, I agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13655)|
| 3:47:38| I think it needs to be a deed restriction that goes on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13658)|
| 3:47:45| Arthur, have you seen the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13665)|
| 3:47:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13669)|
| 3:47:52| Actually, we were submitting cross-deed restrictions Friday afternoon, I think, Mr. Lockett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13672)|
| 3:47:57| and there is a difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13677)|
| 3:48:00| The ones we submitted incorporated basically the language of the Hillcrest Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13680)|
| 3:48:06| which we discussed, I guess, Wednesday at the Intergovernmental Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13686)|
| 3:48:15| Mr. Lockett's restriction was very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13695)|
| 3:48:20| There is room in the middle, I feel confident, to arrive at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13700)|
| 3:48:25| Hillcrest's concern, and I really only have not had a sit-down meeting with Ms. Poynter or their board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13705)|
| 3:48:33| Hillcrest's concern is the way changes are occurring and how we manage nursing homes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13713)|
| 3:48:44| The governor, or at least the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| has indicated that the placing people in nursing homes will continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13727)|
| 3:48:54| but in the future with the baby boom generation hitting the 65-plus age range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13734)|
| 3:49:02| that more of that be done in the home, that people be kept at home as long as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13742)|
| 3:49:08| This whole area is under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13748)|
| 3:49:10| I think Tennessee wants to be a leader in that, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| So, right now we're licensed for 560 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13754)|
| 3:49:20| Well, there may come a time where Hillcrest is treating half those people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13760)|
| 3:49:27| three or four hundred of those people are in a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| The rest of them are being treated at home by periodic skilled care, meals, bathing and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13769)|
| 3:49:39| So, I guess the short answer is I think if Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13779)|
| 3:49:44| He and I were both going different places this morning, if we could sit down and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13784)|
| 3:49:48| I think we could come out with something that's fair to Knox County and fair to Hillcrest that's workable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13788)|
| 3:49:55| Well, Arthur, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13795)|
| 3:49:58| But from what I've heard from what Mr. Lockett has just stated, it's pretty close to where I think it ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13798)|
| 3:50:05| So, I don't know if there's a whole lot of middle ground there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13805)|
| 3:50:08| So, I guess before I could vote on anything tonight, I would have to have that part of any contract in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13808)|
| 3:50:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13816)|
| 3:50:17| Well, we just received it, what, Friday afternoon, Mr. Lockett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13817)|
| 3:50:20| And I think we sent ours at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13820)|
| 3:50:23| So, frankly, we were not able to arrive at a yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13823)|
| 3:50:33| It's your all's decision, Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13833)|
| 3:50:36| All I can report to you is what Mr. Lockett and I have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| And I'm not going to stand up here and say we have an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13840)|
| 3:50:43| I think we could reach an agreement if we had some sit-down time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13843)|
| 3:50:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13848)|
| 3:50:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| I have two residents here that would like to speak, and they're getting a bit tired and need to leave soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13853)|
| 3:50:59| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| I'll be happy to yield my time to them as long as they'll come right back to me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13860)|
| 3:51:07| Would that be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13867)|
| 3:51:10| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13870)|
| 3:51:12| To a loving wife who passed away two years ago, and we both lived together at Lake Brook Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13872)|
| 3:51:23| And when she passed away, it left a big void in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13883)|
| 3:51:31| And these people have picked up a lot of that lost place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13891)|
| 3:51:39| and made me feel more at home than I would have someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13899)|
| 3:51:48| I've been very concerned about the news lately about someone else maybe interested in purchasing the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13908)|
| 3:52:02| And that concerns me simply because I don't know what they will do compared to what I'm getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13922)|
| 3:52:11| And there's no one that knows what's going to take place if you sell it to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13931)|
| 3:52:20| So I ask you to do the right thing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13940)|
| 3:52:27| And these people have been around for almost 50 years, and they've done a great job, at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13947)|
| 3:52:37| So I thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13959)|
| 3:52:40| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13960)|
| 3:52:51| This is Ms. Alexander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13971)|
| 3:53:14| My name is Lida Alexander, and currently I am a resident at the Hillcrest West facility at 6801 Middle Brook Pike, room 314.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=13994)|
| 3:53:26| I would very strongly request that you let Hillcrest be the buyer of this facility and their other four facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14006)|
| 3:53:38| I am extremely well taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14018)|
| 3:53:41| And what nobody in this room knows is I remember your brother, Mr. Pingston, when he sat on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14021)|
| 3:53:49| He was a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14029)|
| 3:53:52| And I'm going to ask you to vote in his memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14032)|
| 3:53:56| Put aside the dollar signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14036)|
| 3:53:59| Vote with his memory the way he would have voted to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14039)|
| 3:54:06| And let Hillcrest be the one to continue to take care of me and the other people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14046)|
| 3:54:12| We are extremely well taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14052)|
| 3:54:16| I have my notes here, and if you'll forgive me to have to go to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14056)|
| 3:54:24| Hillcrest has become a great part of my security system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14064)|
| 3:54:29| I have an outside system of my family and friends, but my CNAs take extremely good care of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14069)|
| 3:54:38| They get me bathed and showered on the days that I'm supposed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14078)|
| 3:54:44| They look out for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14084)|
| 3:54:47| They get me, well, they get me everywhere I need to go, which is obviously here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14087)|
| 3:54:56| I have multiple sclerosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14096)|
| 3:54:58| And so my body has turned against me with this disease, and I am basically paralyzed from the waist down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14098)|
| 3:55:06| I can do nothing with moving my own body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14106)|
| 3:55:10| So they have to transport me with the Hoya lift, which is a full-body lift in a sling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14110)|
| 3:55:16| to get me into bed to change my diaper several times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14116)|
| 3:55:23| And through their help, I have not had any skin breakdowns at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14123)|
| 3:55:37| And it's not easy to sit here and have to talk about my bodily functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14137)|
| 3:55:43| but I have no feeling when I have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14143)|
| 3:55:47| And they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14147)|
| 3:55:48| They clean me up extremely well, and I have not had any skin breakdowns, as I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14148)|
| 3:55:55| Jennifer Collins and Tina Moore and Karen Walker and Karina Kohler take extremely good care of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14155)|
| 3:56:15| and actually spoil me to the point where we all have a big communication network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14175)|
| 3:56:26| I have a wonderful communication network from Pete Prince all the way down to my housekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14186)|
| 3:56:34| If something, I don't like the way something has happened, I can know who to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14194)|
| 3:56:40| I call Pete, or I can call Don Hudson, the director of nursing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14200)|
| 3:56:45| and they will take care of whatever my problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14205)|
| 3:56:49| And they usually come to me personally and want it documented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14209)|
| 3:56:55| and I've always been able to document whatever the problem was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| and they have always taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14218)|
| 3:57:02| And I just can't emphasize enough that they need to be the one to be able to make that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14222)|
| 3:57:17| And under the Hillcrest umbrella that they provide, if it's not broken, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14237)|
| 3:57:28| Leave it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14248)|
| 3:57:29| Let Hillcrest continue to take care of me and the other residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14249)|
| 3:57:35| They don't treat us like we are patients by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14255)|
| 3:57:39| We are referred to as residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| And as such, I am presently the president of the resident council board at Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14261)|
| 3:57:50| We discuss every month the problems that we know that exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| and they always have someone at the meeting that can address those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14276)|
| 3:58:02| and we get the answers for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14282)|
| 3:58:05| We don't have to like the answers, but we get the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14285)|
| 3:58:08| and we have always requested that Mickey Thomas be there for the entire meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14288)|
| 3:58:13| so that she can address any of the admin problems that might exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14293)|
| 3:58:19| And there have been improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| I've been there almost two years, and there have been improvements I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14301)|
| 3:58:26| all the way down from the food to the patient's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14306)|
| 3:58:33| If they send me someone who isn't familiar with the equipment that they use to move me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14313)|
| 3:58:40| I can have the right to say I want someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14320)|
| 3:58:43| And they've always respected all of those rights of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14323)|
| 3:58:47| And, again, I would hope that Mr. Pinkston would vote as his brother would have voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14327)|
| 3:58:58| were he still here, and that is to keep Hillcrest running Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14338)|
| 3:59:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14349)|
| 3:59:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14351)|
| 3:59:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate you all coming down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14359)|
| 3:59:22| and hearing straight from you and appreciate what the workers do to help you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14362)|
| 3:59:29| Mr. Law Director, in your opinion, have we met the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14369)|
| 3:59:36| and procedures to be able to go through with this sale if we were to vote on it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14376)|
| 3:59:40| with the market analysis or the bid process or what we currently have on the books of the bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14380)|
| 3:59:47| or the market analysis that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14387)|
| 3:59:52| I haven't seen a market analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| There was a discussion about market analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14394)|
| 3:59:57| One was performed or one was alluded to, I believe, in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14397)|
| 4:00:05| I haven't seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14405)|
| 4:00:06| I don't know if any other commissioners have seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14406)|
| 4:00:09| And I also believe that, under any circumstances, there's a need for an appraisal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14409)|
| 4:00:18| according to the Knox County ordinances, by a certified appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14418)|
| 4:00:26| So, in your opinion, we can't even approve this tonight as written or presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14426)|
| 4:00:34| That would be your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14434)|
| 4:00:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14435)|
| 4:00:39| Then I'm going to make a substitute motion that we ask for, and I'll give the mayor the leeway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14439)|
| 4:00:47| because, personally, I would like to see Hillcrest be able to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14447)|
| 4:00:54| I think we either need to have a certified appraisal done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14454)|
| 4:00:59| or we need to have a market analysis that meets the requirements of a market analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14459)|
| 4:01:05| if we're just going to have the one bidder so that when it comes back before us we can meet Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14465)|
| 4:01:12| I will second Commissioner Luthal's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14474)|
| 4:01:16| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14476)|
| 4:01:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14478)|
| 4:01:21| I'd like to clear up something that may be a misunderstanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14481)|
| 4:01:24| and I think Commissioner Briggs will understand what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14484)|
| 4:01:28| He talked about a CON, a certificate of need, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14488)|
| 4:01:34| What's before this commission is about the land and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14494)|
| 4:01:39| If you have another nursing home facility company that's interested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14499)|
| 4:01:47| keep in mind that it is not worth anything to them unless they have the bed licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14507)|
| 4:01:55| And I read this in a paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| I don't have any other information, but it's something about $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14517)|
| 4:02:04| They have to buy the bed license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14524)|
| 4:02:07| The real estate is worth nothing to them without the bed license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14527)|
| 4:02:12| If you get an appraisal done or when you get an appraisal done, normally they do a best use appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14532)|
| 4:02:19| If you get an appraisal done on this property to be used as a nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14539)|
| 4:02:25| and I don't know what else you, I guess that's the best use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14545)|
| 4:02:29| you've got to factor in the idea that it's not worth anything without a bed license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14549)|
| 4:02:34| The state of Tennessee is not going to issue any more bed licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14554)|
| 4:02:37| They haven't issued any in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14557)|
| 4:02:41| And so the property without the bed license is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14561)|
| 4:02:48| I don't think anything that you can really appraise properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14568)|
| 4:02:52| and I'm going to suggest that you're not going to get any bids for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14572)|
| 4:02:56| because we've got 560 residents that have to live somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14576)|
| 4:03:01| and if somebody can't take those residents in the nursing home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14581)|
| 4:03:06| there's just not going to be any interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14586)|
| 4:03:08| That was a lot of the negotiation that went on was the property is being used right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14588)|
| 4:03:15| for what it needs to be used for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14595)|
| 4:03:18| and so how can we best facilitate that and go on going into the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14598)|
| 4:03:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14605)|
| 4:03:26| Just a second, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14606)|
| 4:03:27| Mr. Law Director, could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14607)|
| 4:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14610)|
| 4:03:32| In complying with the Knox County ordinance, the appraisal is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14612)|
| 4:03:38| and that should be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14618)|
| 4:03:40| The observations that you made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14620)|
| 4:03:43| and, Mayor, maybe if you're going to comment on the appraisal, that's fine, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14623)|
| 4:03:48| But if it's been done in the past 12 months by a certified appraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14628)|
| 4:03:54| then that would comply with the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14634)|
| 4:03:56| That's what it requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14636)|
| 4:03:59| But the comments that this gentleman just made are apt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| because we're not talking about a typical having someone just go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14644)|
| 4:04:09| and appraise the fair market value of the real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14649)|
| 4:04:14| because what this commission is talking about doing is if it is transferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14654)|
| 4:04:21| and I'll leave it to this body to correct my understanding if I haven't heard it properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14661)|
| 4:04:29| but any transfer of this property is going to be subject to the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14669)|
| 4:04:34| that I alluded to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14674)|
| 4:04:36| So when an appraiser goes to look at this, it's going to be, as he said, with that use in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14676)|
| 4:04:44| It's not just here's this acreage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14684)|
| 4:04:49| and I'm going to appraise it as far as a best use for this acreage wherever it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14689)|
| 4:04:54| It's going to be the use that it is restricted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14694)|
| 4:04:58| And with that restriction go these other legal requirements of having the bed license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14698)|
| 4:05:05| So that's how the property is going to be valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14705)|
| 4:05:11| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14711)|
| 4:05:12| Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14712)|
| 4:05:14| We have an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14714)|
| 4:05:16| It's May of this year by John Whitehead, CAE, certified appraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14716)|
| 4:05:22| in the amount of $16,200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14722)|
| 4:05:26| So appraisal is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14726)|
| 4:05:28| I would hope that this evening you'd send a message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14728)|
| 4:05:30| Send a message to Hillcrest that you want to do business with them or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14730)|
| 4:05:35| And I think you've heard from a couple of their residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14735)|
| 4:05:39| who could sum it up much more appropriately than I ever could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14739)|
| 4:05:43| But you have your appraisal right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| Mr. Lockett, have you had a chance to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14745)|
| 4:05:48| and make sure that that meets our ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14748)|
| 4:05:53| I've seen the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| I don't know if that letter is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14755)|
| 4:05:58| On the stationery of our Knox County Property Assessor with his designation as CAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14758)|
| 4:06:05| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14765)|
| 4:06:09| Well, I'm still going to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14769)|
| 4:06:12| I have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14772)|
| 4:06:14| I didn't know if this. . . Is Mr. Whitehead still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14774)|
| 4:06:21| I have seen that, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| I would typically. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| An appraisal is a little bit more extensive than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14787)|
| 4:06:31| And I would like to at least question Mr. Whitehead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| to see if there is something else that he has that supports that valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14793)|
| 4:06:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14803)|
| 4:06:44| But as far as the ordinance, the requirements of the ordinance say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14804)|
| 4:06:53| you have to have an appraisal within the past 12 months by a certified appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14813)|
| 4:06:58| That's within the past 12 months by a certified appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14818)|
| 4:07:03| Mr. Lutho, I believe there's somebody else there wanting to talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14823)|
| 4:07:07| Well, I just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| One more comment is that when we do get back to whether or not we can sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14829)|
| 4:07:18| I'm not going to be necessarily in favor of doing owner financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14838)|
| 4:07:22| I think if we're going to sell it, we need to just sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14842)|
| 4:07:25| I don't think the county is in the business of financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14845)|
| 4:07:28| and just allow whoever buys it to find their own financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14848)|
| 4:07:36| and allow Knox County to use those funds to however we decide to designate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14856)|
| 4:07:43| whether it's to pay off some debt or to do something else with it that could be decided later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14863)|
| 4:07:50| But, you know, 1% interest only the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14870)|
| 4:07:56| We're talking about $60,000 out of a $640-$50 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14876)|
| 4:08:03| You know, $120,000 the year after, and then I believe 3%, so that would be $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14883)|
| 4:08:15| It's a lot of money, but within the overall budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14895)|
| 4:08:21| I do believe that Knox County would be better off just selling it and allowing it to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14901)|
| 4:08:28| Like I said, I'm not against Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14908)|
| 4:08:29| I'd like Hillcrest to be the purchaser of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14909)|
| 4:08:32| but I do think we have policies and procedures and we do need to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14912)|
| 4:08:36| If we do have an appraisal that meets those, then we can proceed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14916)|
| 4:08:42| But I'm going to have to listen to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14922)|
| 4:08:45| Well, we do have an appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14925)|
| 4:08:47| It's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14927)|
| 4:08:48| It's by someone who's registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14928)|
| 4:08:49| I can assure you he just didn't come up with it off the top of his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14929)|
| 4:08:52| He'd lose his license, I think, if he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14932)|
| 4:08:55| I think it's a good appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14935)|
| 4:08:56| We've discussed it with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14936)|
| 4:08:58| And, again, you can talk about money and what kind of cost it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14938)|
| 4:09:02| and we do have a fiduciary responsibility, very importantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14942)|
| 4:09:05| On the other hand, that responsibility is overwhelmingly superseded by the people you saw tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14945)|
| 4:09:12| without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14952)|
| 4:09:15| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14955)|
| 4:09:16| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14956)|
| 4:09:18| We also have to have, the law director says we also still have to have the market analysis, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14958)|
| 4:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14965)|
| 4:09:28| I appreciate all of the remarks that have been made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14968)|
| 4:09:33| I do prefer to do business on a local level with people that have demonstrated their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14973)|
| 4:09:40| and willingness to really serve the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14980)|
| 4:09:44| and that's who we are trying to serve, ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14984)|
| 4:09:49| I do think when we structure whatever deal, we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14989)|
| 4:09:54| part of the difficulty that they're in right now is because of the deal that hasn't changed in 48 years or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=14994)|
| 4:10:01| It does seem to me that we need to look at structuring this thing in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15001)|
| 4:10:05| that we don't tie their hands so that as changes in the delivery of health care occur, which occur daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15005)|
| 4:10:13| that we don't make it impossible for them to adapt and grow and change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15013)|
| 4:10:18| and prosper as circumstances change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15018)|
| 4:10:22| And I'm a little bit concerned when we talk about the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15022)|
| 4:10:26| While I understand that we want to ensure that this population is served long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15026)|
| 4:10:31| I think surely to goodness we can take care of that on a contract basis long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15031)|
| 4:10:37| We've got to give them some ability to change as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15037)|
| 4:10:41| I very much appreciate the mayor's candor in his remarks earlier and just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15041)|
| 4:10:47| and I think I really do understand most of the concerns that have been raised tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15047)|
| 4:10:53| but I would favor moving on with this, making an arrangement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15053)|
| 4:10:58| and making sure that the citizens of Knox County are served long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15058)|
| 4:11:03| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15063)|
| 4:11:05| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15065)|
| 4:11:08| Yeah, I'm less concerned with the finances of this deal than I am with the terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15068)|
| 4:11:13| and I absolutely support the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15073)|
| 4:11:17| I do support privatization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15077)|
| 4:11:19| I believe that if Hillcrest takes possession of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15079)|
| 4:11:23| it will enable them to get the capital they need to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15083)|
| 4:11:28| So, you know, and I'm not concerned with whose idea it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15088)|
| 4:11:32| This was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15092)|
| 4:11:35| But with that said, this deal is not completely negotiated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15095)|
| 4:11:40| We're still in the process of negotiating the deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15100)|
| 4:11:45| We're still in the process of figuring out whether we can even legally do this as an outright sale rather than as an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15105)|
| 4:11:54| So while I think this is a good idea and while I support many aspects of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15114)|
| 4:12:01| I'm voting for Mr. Luthold's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15121)|
| 4:12:04| This deal is not ready, and I think that for us to rush something through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15124)|
| 4:12:09| and vote for something that's not ready where we don't know the terms is very irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15129)|
| 4:12:14| And so I'm going to vote for the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15134)|
| 4:12:17| and the message I want to send to the mayor and to Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15137)|
| 4:12:19| and to anyone else who's interested in making a proposal for this is that I'm more concerned that whoever is in these locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15139)|
| 4:12:31| that they have a long-term fixed commitment to take care of the indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15151)|
| 4:12:36| And I'm less concerned with the amount of money this property brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15156)|
| 4:12:40| I know that, you know, the property may be worth considerably more to build condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15160)|
| 4:12:46| I know that when you have deed restrictions in place that say you're going to have to take care of the indigent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15166)|
| 4:12:54| that that's going to make this worth a lot less money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15174)|
| 4:12:56| So I wouldn't even mind if, you know, if at the end of the day we ended up giving this property away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15176)|
| 4:13:03| if it was with some very strong deed restrictions that required a majority of indigent patients being cared for in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15183)|
| 4:13:11| But this deal isn't ready, and I'm not ready to vote for it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15191)|
| 4:13:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15195)|
| 4:13:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15198)|
| 4:13:21| I think of all the discussions or all the comments I've heard, I think I like Mr. Smith's the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15201)|
| 4:13:26| that a lot of this is above my head, certainly above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15206)|
| 4:13:31| And so I appreciate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15211)|
| 4:13:34| I appreciate both of you all coming and speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15214)|
| 4:13:38| I think a lot of, of course, a lot of good points are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15218)|
| 4:13:42| This is a very difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15222)|
| 4:13:44| I think maybe we're breaking a record on one item discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15224)|
| 4:13:49| And certainly I think probably further negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15229)|
| 4:13:54| and discussions regarding contracts or the financial considerations are due,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15234)|
| 4:14:00| and we're just going to have to shift to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15240)|
| 4:14:02| But what I would like to say is that I have some personal observations about nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15242)|
| 4:14:13| Unfortunately, my mother was in a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| She was quadriplegic for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| And so I have some pretty close observations that I've made in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15257)|
| 4:14:26| and I had the opportunity to visit Hillcrest, Hillcrest West, and the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15266)|
| 4:14:32| and spend some time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| And I cannot tell you how impressed I am and I was with that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15274)|
| 4:14:41| And because of, I mean, if anybody gave consideration at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15281)|
| 4:14:48| and I think it has to be a primary consideration to the care of the patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15288)|
| 4:14:52| and just in terms of how the facility was, its cleanliness, its spaciousness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15292)|
| 4:15:00| its orderliness, the professionalism of the staff, I was just totally impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15300)|
| 4:15:10| And so I wanted to convey that to my colleagues on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15310)|
| 4:15:14| And if I have anything to do with it, I'll do my absolute best to make sure that Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15314)|
| 4:15:19| retains operations of this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15321)|
| 4:15:24| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15324)|
| 4:15:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15328)|
| 4:15:30| For some of those that have not been here before for some of these all-night meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15330)|
| 4:15:35| sometimes I'll take notes and then I dump all my notes at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15335)|
| 4:15:41| The first note that I have to make is that I can remember the poor farm at Maloney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15341)|
| 4:15:49| or as some people call it Maloneville now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15349)|
| 4:15:53| We, the county, still have things at Maloneville, but not the poor farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15353)|
| 4:15:59| One of the questions that's been asked tonight is how do other counties in the state of Tennessee do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15359)|
| 4:16:06| I think maybe that's still a question that I'd like to hear answered, but not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15366)|
| 4:16:12| Another, Mr. Seymour made a comment about sit down and meet with them on some of these contract things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15372)|
| 4:16:19| I think we still need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| We are not dictating how health care takes place in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15381)|
| 4:16:27| We're simply wanting to be satisfied on this commission that the correct things take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15387)|
| 4:16:38| I don't know what the outcome will be on taking bids or RFPs or all that sort of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15398)|
| 4:16:45| but rest assured I'm with Commissioner Norman when I say, Hillcrest, you're the people that need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15405)|
| 4:16:56| Also, then, I need to back up and go the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15416)|
| 4:16:59| and say that emotion should not be the way we make our decision tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15419)|
| 4:17:05| because you are a proven valuable member of Knox County, and you've been here for 48 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15425)|
| 4:17:10| I'd written down 50, but I hear people say 48 several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15430)|
| 4:17:15| I know you're meeting the residents' slash citizens' needs of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15435)|
| 4:17:22| I've had church members that have been residents at North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15442)|
| 4:17:28| I've been in and out of that building, and I know about that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15448)|
| 4:17:32| which brings up something that I'd like to see incorporated in what it is that we're going to do between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15452)|
| 4:17:37| and when we finally vote on this in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15457)|
| 4:17:44| I would like to see a public meeting at all three locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15464)|
| 4:17:48| And remember that for I have a reason for asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15468)|
| 4:17:54| I don't think it's about price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15474)|
| 4:17:56| I don't think it's about the greedy citizens of Knox County that are willing to extract the most money that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15476)|
| 4:18:02| from the sale of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15482)|
| 4:18:05| I go back again and say we're not greedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15485)|
| 4:18:08| We just want to make sure that the right thing is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15488)|
| 4:18:11| because money was the first thing that struck me whenever this came up a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15491)|
| 4:18:17| If you go from $6 million to $16 million, there's a lot of instant equity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15497)|
| 4:18:23| Where's that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15503)|
| 4:18:25| I think we have to ask that question no matter how much it may hurt our feelings to ask it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15505)|
| 4:18:31| or your feelings to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15511)|
| 4:18:34| One of the things that we've talked about is deed restrictions going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15514)|
| 4:18:38| Have we really talked tonight about deed restrictions from the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15518)|
| 4:18:42| What did we put on the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15522)|
| 4:18:44| What did the state put on us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15524)|
| 4:18:45| What happened 50 years ago when deeds were transferred around back then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15525)|
| 4:18:50| Do we have something that we need to uncover there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15530)|
| 4:18:54| The appraisal thing also concerned me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15534)|
| 4:18:56| It's like apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15536)|
| 4:18:58| It's whatever that terminology is for a certificate of need or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15538)|
| 4:19:03| I know that we're only talking about real estate buildings and for what they're designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15543)|
| 4:19:15| Some people have said, is it $5,000 a month or $22 million up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15555)|
| 4:19:21| That's sort of personal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15561)|
| 4:19:23| I could probably afford to buy the place if it was $5,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15563)|
| 4:19:27| Well, at least Larry and I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15567)|
| 4:19:33| But if it's going to be $22 million, that's considerably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| That's like talking about Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15577)|
| 4:19:40| You know right off, right up front, you can't talk about that much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15580)|
| 4:19:45| and not talk about it for about a year or two years or three years or ever how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15585)|
| 4:19:55| But now I've got down to, well, I forgot what that question was you were supposed to ask me a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15595)|
| 4:20:01| The most important thing that we need, we, fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15601)|
| 4:20:06| this is the charge to us, is that we need to get this in such a place that we like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15606)|
| 4:20:14| and that we're 100% in agreement that what we're about and what we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15614)|
| 4:20:20| is 100% in the best interest of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15620)|
| 4:20:27| So having said that, whoever's got a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15627)|
| 4:20:32| I would like to have, if it would be a friendly amendment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15632)|
| 4:20:36| to say that we would have three public meetings in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15636)|
| 4:20:41| That's fine with me as long as, you know, the rest of the commission wishes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15641)|
| 4:20:46| I don't have any objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15646)|
| 4:20:48| And that we get some answers to some more questions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15648)|
| 4:20:53| New questions come up all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15653)|
| 4:20:56| We will have new questions within the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15656)|
| 4:20:59| But if we can have three meetings, if we can have three workshops, we don't have to go to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15659)|
| 4:21:05| But I think it would be in our best interest to know what it is that we're trying to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15665)|
| 4:21:10| and really, really, really work to get together and get this thing behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15670)|
| 4:21:15| and do it with some unanimity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15675)|
| 4:21:18| Thank you for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15678)|
| 4:21:20| Commissioner Harmon, are you okay with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15680)|
| 4:21:23| I'll pass the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15683)|
| 4:21:24| Second's okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| Yes, I'm going to have to agree with Mr. Wright there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15689)|
| 4:21:33| You know, like I said before, we've got to take care of the engineer just like we have to take care of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15693)|
| 4:21:38| and I think we need to get a lot of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15698)|
| 4:21:40| But, Mr. Chairman, there's some people here I think that want to talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15700)|
| 4:21:46| We have several likes, and I'm sure we have quite a few other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15706)|
| 4:21:49| Anyway, I'd like to yield my time to one here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15709)|
| 4:21:52| If they can answer some questions about this certificate, bed certificate and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15712)|
| 4:21:57| Who did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15717)|
| 4:21:59| I believe it's Mr. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15719)|
| 4:22:00| I just met him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15720)|
| 4:22:01| He came in and presented a lease for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15721)|
| 4:22:06| State your name for me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15726)|
| 4:22:07| My name is Gary Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15727)|
| 4:22:08| I reside at 115 Beechnut Street, Johnson City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15728)|
| 4:22:13| I'm Vice President of Care Centers Management Consulting Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15733)|
| 4:22:19| I'd just like to say that we have three facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15739)|
| 4:22:22| We have eight facilities that we operate in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15742)|
| 4:22:26| We have three facilities in our family of facilities that were formerly county-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15746)|
| 4:22:32| And we think we understand how to work with the vision and the original vision of these kinds of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15752)|
| 4:22:39| I'd also like to say, and I'm impressed with the support from the staff and residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15759)|
| 4:22:46| but we could bring a lot of people here who used to work for somebody else, who now work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15766)|
| 4:22:54| and they'd be supporting us strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15774)|
| 4:22:56| And all the members, the leadership in those counties will overwhelmingly say, we made a good decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15776)|
| 4:23:04| So I'm just going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15784)|
| 4:23:06| So change is not always bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15786)|
| 4:23:08| Sometimes change is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15788)|
| 4:23:10| And I would encourage you as you go forward in this to look at all the options that you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15790)|
| 4:23:16| that you can bring before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15796)|
| 4:23:18| And that's my spiel, and I'll answer some questions or try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15798)|
| 4:23:23| I would encourage you to educate yourself in the next little bit over CONs, licenses, how those work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15803)|
| 4:23:30| I can tell you my opinion, and it's an accurate opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15810)|
| 4:23:35| but you probably want to bring somebody in who has legal credentials to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15815)|
| 4:23:40| How Medicaid works, how capital expenses are paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15820)|
| 4:23:45| A lot of things that are out here tonight that you need probably more answers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15825)|
| 4:23:51| The severity of the kinds of deficiencies that exist here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15831)|
| 4:23:56| Faye Vance can talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15836)|
| 4:23:58| She's right here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15838)|
| 4:24:01| And she's the East Regional Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15841)|
| 4:24:04| So there are ways you can educate yourself, and I would encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15844)|
| 4:24:09| What did you say the name of your firm was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15849)|
| 4:24:11| Care Centers Management Consulting Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15851)|
| 4:24:15| Sir, when did you find out about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15855)|
| 4:24:19| We've actually been pursuing, we've expressed an interest in the facility for about 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15859)|
| 4:24:28| and purchasing, leasing the facility for about 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15868)|
| 4:24:32| Again, we've visited most of the county-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15872)|
| 4:24:36| Someone had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15876)|
| 4:24:37| I know all of them west of, east of, about 50 miles west of Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15877)|
| 4:24:44| Do you manage any county-owned nursing homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15884)|
| 4:24:47| We have three that are former county-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| We purchased two of them outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15889)|
| 4:24:51| We leased one for about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15891)|
| 4:24:53| At the time, the commissioners really wanted to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15893)|
| 4:24:57| but they didn't think they had the political support of the people to sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15897)|
| 4:25:01| just because they were afraid of change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15901)|
| 4:25:04| And after three years, they agreed to sell it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15904)|
| 4:25:07| I don't know anybody in that county unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15907)|
| 4:25:11| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15911)|
| 4:25:12| Would you happen to know what the national, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15912)|
| 4:25:16| the state of Tennessee's average is on Medicare in nursing home patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15916)|
| 4:25:22| Tennessee is, I think the figure you threw out, 66, is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15922)|
| 4:25:26| I haven't looked at that in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15926)|
| 4:25:28| It's close to what we run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15928)|
| 4:25:29| We have some buildings run around 70 or a little more than 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15929)|
| 4:25:33| Oh, in the nursing homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15933)|
| 4:25:34| If 70% does not faze us at all, we would never turn down somebody on Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15934)|
| 4:25:41| Never turn down anybody on Medicaid for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15941)|
| 4:25:44| We may not be able to meet their care needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15944)|
| 4:25:46| And there are ways, I know, that people can manipulate some of these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15946)|
| 4:25:51| But we take some very, very heavy care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15951)|
| 4:25:56| We are committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15956)|
| 4:26:01| We're proposing a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15961)|
| 4:26:03| That way the commission can look at its decision months down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15963)|
| 4:26:09| and determine whether it made a good one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15969)|
| 4:26:12| You can always back out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15972)|
| 4:26:13| If you sell it, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15973)|
| 4:26:17| Well, you're proposing a lease like Hillcrest has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15977)|
| 4:26:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15980)|
| 4:26:21| A little different, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15981)|
| 4:26:27| But we would be interested in purchasing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15987)|
| 4:26:29| We just think a lease is maybe more comfortable on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15989)|
| 4:26:34| So you have the security of knowing that you've made the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15994)|
| 4:26:37| You can get out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=15997)|
| 4:26:40| But we'd be interested in purchasing them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16000)|
| 4:26:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16002)|
| 4:26:43| Certificate of need, you ask about the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16003)|
| 4:26:46| License is tied to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16006)|
| 4:26:50| The only way anyone can take the license, if you broke the lease today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16010)|
| 4:26:55| whoever you brought in to manage would own the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16015)|
| 4:26:57| They would reapply for the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16017)|
| 4:26:59| It would be issued in their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16019)|
| 4:27:04| This is serious misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16024)|
| 4:27:10| I'm not trying to ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16030)|
| 4:27:13| You need to educate yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16033)|
| 4:27:15| Where could we find this out, sir, what you're saying just now about the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16035)|
| 4:27:20| Well, I would just start with a certificate of need board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16040)|
| 4:27:24| Contact the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16044)|
| 4:27:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16045)|
| 4:27:26| But there are plenty of attorneys that work with certificates of need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16046)|
| 4:27:29| and work in transferring the ownership of certificates of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16049)|
| 4:27:34| In my opinion, this is a real serious issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16054)|
| 4:27:37| Oh, I think it is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16057)|
| 4:27:38| If I were an owner, I'd be very, very, very concerned about this, very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16058)|
| 4:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16064)|
| 4:27:46| Mr. Parker, you mentioned that you wouldn't be able to take care of some of the patients' care needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16066)|
| 4:27:56| What do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16076)|
| 4:27:58| Well, there are occasionally people who have problems that simply don't have the capabilities of meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16078)|
| 4:28:06| But that doesn't happen very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16086)|
| 4:28:08| We do evaluate somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16088)|
| 4:28:11| You can't take somebody that you can't meet their care needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16091)|
| 4:28:16| It's a violation of the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16096)|
| 4:28:18| We don't question either of them, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16098)|
| 4:28:20| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16100)|
| 4:28:21| And I don't know if they turn anyone down, but you could probably ask and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16101)|
| 4:28:27| Which three counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16107)|
| 4:28:30| Two Tennessee counties, Robertson County, Cheatham County, Robertson County, and Springfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16110)|
| 4:28:35| It's now the Christian Care Center of Springfield and Cheatham County and Ashland City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16115)|
| 4:28:42| If you want to look these up, it's the Christian Care Center of Ashland City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16122)|
| 4:28:45| We have a facility in Garrard County, Kentucky, which was also a county-owned facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16125)|
| 4:28:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16133)|
| 4:28:55| Yes, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16135)|
| 4:28:56| It's really on this definition of indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16136)|
| 4:28:59| And maybe you can answer that at the podium also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16139)|
| 4:29:03| Because my understanding is usually when patients go into nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16143)|
| 4:29:07| the case managers will look at their resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16147)|
| 4:29:11| And the way that you get them frequently on Medicaid is they have to spend down their personal resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16151)|
| 4:29:16| to a certain level until they qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16156)|
| 4:29:19| So how many patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| We're talking about people who take care of indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| I mean, what percentage of patients do you receive absolutely nothing on if you've got good case managers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16163)|
| 4:29:32| That only occurs for us when we made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16172)|
| 4:29:36| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16176)|
| 4:29:37| And I would assume it to be the same here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16177)|
| 4:29:41| And another point that I would like to make, I agree with Commissioner Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16181)|
| 4:29:46| is that I think we have to be a little bit careful about some of the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16186)|
| 4:29:51| because this feel is changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| And they are mentioning that there's more and more care given at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16193)|
| 4:29:56| And I would assume that you would agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16196)|
| 4:30:00| that sometimes those deed restrictions may be okay today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16200)|
| 4:30:05| but they might not be okay five years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16205)|
| 4:30:11| You know, if you're talking about doing different kinds of care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16211)|
| 4:30:14| we're very familiar with the greenhouse project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16214)|
| 4:30:17| No, no, what I was referring to more is saying you have to take care of a certain percentage of indigents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16217)|
| 4:30:23| But if more and more care is given at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16223)|
| 4:30:27| then some of that may change is where your higher acuity would be in an inpatient facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16227)|
| 4:30:34| whereas maybe the lower acuity that now is inpatient might be transferred back to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16234)|
| 4:30:40| That could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16240)|
| 4:30:42| Our commitment would be that we will not turn away someone because they're on Medicaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16242)|
| 4:30:47| That doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| We don't do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16250)|
| 4:30:51| We certainly wouldn't do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16251)|
| 4:30:52| And people in general aren't being kicked out of nursing homes that are on Medicaid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16252)|
| 4:30:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16256)|
| 4:30:57| And let me just make one comment real quick on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16257)|
| 4:31:01| We're talking about our facilities or other facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16261)|
| 4:31:04| I don't know what goes on at other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16264)|
| 4:31:06| Yeah, okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16266)|
| 4:31:07| But I just do want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16267)|
| 4:31:09| There are certain conditions that nursing homes can't take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16269)|
| 4:31:14| And I know recently there was a case where someone was on a ventilator and dialysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16274)|
| 4:31:21| And I don't think there was any place in the state of Tennessee that we could get them taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16281)|
| 4:31:24| and they had to go up to Ohio where there was a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16284)|
| 4:31:26| And I believe that there are things that you can't take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16286)|
| 4:31:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16290)|
| 4:31:32| We could have gotten that person probably in Mount Vernon, Kentucky, a little bit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16292)|
| 4:31:37| But there's a lung unit there, long-term care unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16297)|
| 4:31:42| And they can do dialysis both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16302)|
| 4:31:44| That was the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16304)|
| 4:31:46| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16306)|
| 4:31:47| But I'll drop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16307)|
| 4:31:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16308)|
| 4:31:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16309)|
| 4:31:52| I'd like to make just a quick observation to other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16312)|
| 4:31:57| I'd like for the staff, the staff, a lot of you here, would you please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16317)|
| 4:32:00| I'd like to address you just for a quick second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16320)|
| 4:32:03| Not the administration, just the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16323)|
| 4:32:10| You know, this has been in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16330)|
| 4:32:12| It's been very highly publicized what's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16332)|
| 4:32:16| I have been to two of the facilities, like Tony Norman there visiting his mom and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16336)|
| 4:32:22| Over the years I've had a lot of clients in Hillcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16342)|
| 4:32:26| I've had a lot of employees insured at Hillcrest, and I've been there quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16346)|
| 4:32:31| And usually when we have something like this, as long as we've got the period that we have to research this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16351)|
| 4:32:39| that's when we hear the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16359)|
| 4:32:42| That's when we hear, oh, don't approve this, don't approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16362)|
| 4:32:45| because my mom or my dad was there and something bad went wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16365)|
| 4:32:50| Of all the phone calls, all the e-mails, and I have got a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16370)|
| 4:32:55| and I know the other commissioners have too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| I have not received one bad complaint about your care that you have given to any of your patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16377)|
| 4:33:03| And I want to applaud you for that and the care that you've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16383)|
| 4:33:07| And that was expressed by Mr. Smith here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16387)|
| 4:33:19| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| Are you the same group, the so-called cornerstone group that we heard about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16403)|
| 4:33:30| No, I think they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16410)|
| 4:33:31| Oh, they're here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16411)|
| 4:33:32| So we've got another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16412)|
| 4:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16413)|
| 4:33:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16414)|
| 4:33:35| I'm going to just ask you one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16415)|
| 4:33:38| I'm going to just paraphrase a couple of sentences from a letter that was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16418)|
| 4:33:43| It was public record, so I don't think I'm revealing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16423)|
| 4:33:48| In essence, it was suggested that if this transaction did not move forward to sell the Hillcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16428)|
| 4:33:54| that we would put at risk turning out on the street or just turning out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16434)|
| 4:34:00| I'm going to embellish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16440)|
| 4:34:02| Turning out more than 500 of our community's most fragile and frail residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16442)|
| 4:34:07| and putting 600 dedicated employees out of work in a very challenging environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16447)|
| 4:34:12| Would you respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16452)|
| 4:34:14| If, hypothetically, your company got this Hillcrest tomorrow, how would you address those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16454)|
| 4:34:21| We would immediately retain the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16461)|
| 4:34:24| We'd keep every resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16464)|
| 4:34:26| We'd meet with the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16466)|
| 4:34:28| There are not enough people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16468)|
| 4:34:31| I'm absolutely certain to replace the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16471)|
| 4:34:34| Every staff person who shows up for work and has good work ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16474)|
| 4:34:39| and good work practices would be offered a position, be offered a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16479)|
| 4:34:48| We'd certainly want to keep every resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16488)|
| 4:34:52| It's just very misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16492)|
| 4:34:58| So no one would lose their bed, their room, their status at the facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16498)|
| 4:35:05| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16505)|
| 4:35:06| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16506)|
| 4:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16508)|
| 4:35:09| Again, we've done this several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16509)|
| 4:35:12| In your transactions in the other county facilities you took over, were they also leases or were they purchases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16512)|
| 4:35:19| Two of them were purchases outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16519)|
| 4:35:21| One of them was a lease for about three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16521)|
| 4:35:25| We had an option to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16525)|
| 4:35:28| We did the lease for a while until everybody got comfortable with change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16528)|
| 4:35:33| And there was one out of, I think, 13 commissioners, one person voted against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16533)|
| 4:35:40| He wasn't really opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16540)|
| 4:35:43| It was just a political matter for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16543)|
| 4:35:45| But it's overwhelmingly supported by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16545)|
| 4:35:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16547)|
| 4:35:48| And are you a for-profit or non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16548)|
| 4:35:50| We are essentially a for-profit company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16550)|
| 4:35:53| This can be structured as a not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16553)|
| 4:35:56| That's not hard to do at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16556)|
| 4:35:59| And, you know, we'd be willing to sit down and say, what do you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16559)|
| 4:36:03| Let's see if we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16563)|
| 4:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16565)|
| 4:36:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16566)|
| 4:36:08| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16568)|
| 4:36:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16569)|
| 4:36:11| I know we're getting close to where we've got to say halt because we're running up against zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16571)|
| 4:36:17| Judge Bozeman and even myself may be accused at times of getting fairly conversational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16577)|
| 4:36:25| in how we go about doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16585)|
| 4:36:28| But my question to the gentleman at the podium and to other interested parties that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16588)|
| 4:36:34| it's just like other questions that have come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16594)|
| 4:36:38| Are you conversational with us tonight or are you making a proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16598)|
| 4:36:43| And I think that sometime in the next few days, in connection with whatever it is that we're going to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16603)|
| 4:36:49| and do over the next few weeks, that it needs to be more of a proposal than it needs to be conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16609)|
| 4:36:57| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16617)|
| 4:37:00| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16620)|
| 4:37:02| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16622)|
| 4:37:04| Can I make a substitute motion or are we out of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16624)|
| 4:37:07| We already have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16627)|
| 4:37:09| Let me make an observation then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16629)|
| 4:37:11| It's very evident that we're not going to be able to vote on this thing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16631)|
| 4:37:16| and any more time we spend on it, this tonight is redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16636)|
| 4:37:21| because we're going to have to hear it over again when these proposals come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16641)|
| 4:37:24| So I'd like to suggest that we deal with it, move on, and decide something right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16644)|
| 4:37:32| Did I hear a call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16652)|
| 4:37:34| I wish you'd said that about two hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16654)|
| 4:37:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16658)|
| 4:37:40| Commissioner Pinkston, where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16660)|
| 4:37:43| He still has his light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16663)|
| 4:37:44| Could you cut his light off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16664)|
| 4:37:47| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16667)|
| 4:37:48| Can you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16668)|
| 4:37:51| I ask that the mayor's office seek certified appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16671)|
| 4:37:57| If they already have one, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16677)|
| 4:38:00| But I also think we also need a market analysis if we are just going to accept bids from one vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16680)|
| 4:38:09| So we would need a market analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16689)|
| 4:38:12| and also with Commissioner Wright's three public hearings, one at each of the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16692)|
| 4:38:17| Is that correct, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16697)|
| 4:38:22| And if you'd like, I could put a time frame on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16702)|
| 4:38:27| or we can leave it in the mayor's hands to get it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16707)|
| 4:38:30| Mayor, would you rather just be able to get it to us when you're able to get it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16710)|
| 4:38:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16714)|
| 4:38:38| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16718)|
| 4:38:39| Mr. Chairman, we've got another gentleman who drove up from Nashville I'd like to hear speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16719)|
| 4:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16724)|
| 4:38:48| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16728)|
| 4:38:49| I'm John Simonton with Cornerstone Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16729)|
| 4:38:52| My address is 22615 Highway 22 North, Yuma, Tennessee, 38390.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16732)|
| 4:38:58| I want to commend the commission tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16738)|
| 4:39:00| I know it's a tough battle for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16740)|
| 4:39:02| There is emotions involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16742)|
| 4:39:04| There's a fiduciary duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16744)|
| 4:39:06| I know you've got a tough job ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16746)|
| 4:39:08| There's not much more than I can add that Mr. Parker has not said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16748)|
| 4:39:12| We basically do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16752)|
| 4:39:14| We lease, we own, we manage facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16754)|
| 4:39:19| I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16759)|
| 4:39:20| I think the commission has got a lot of bad information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16760)|
| 4:39:24| and that you really need some kind of exploratory committee to get these questions cleared up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16764)|
| 4:39:32| so that you'll know what you do want to propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16772)|
| 4:39:36| The question was brought up was this conversation or a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16776)|
| 4:39:41| A proposal cannot really be made until we know what the commission is looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16781)|
| 4:39:48| Restrictions affect price, lots of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16788)|
| 4:39:55| I'd be glad to look at anything that you do put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16795)|
| 4:39:58| and see what I could do for you and the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16798)|
| 4:40:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16805)|
| 4:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16806)|
| 4:40:07| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16807)|
| 4:40:09| I think everyone's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16809)|
| 4:40:11| Oh, we have someone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16811)|
| 4:40:12| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16812)|
| 4:40:19| I'd like to say that the stress here is on indigent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16819)|
| 4:40:26| And I might be one someday, but I'm not one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16826)|
| 4:40:31| I pay my way at Assisted Living, Lakebrook Assisted Living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16831)|
| 4:40:37| and I'm sure that you'll make the right decision sooner or later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16837)|
| 4:40:43| but whatever you do will affect me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16843)|
| 4:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16847)|
| 4:40:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16848)|
| 4:40:55| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16855)|
| 4:40:57| Can you repeat the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16857)|
| 4:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16861)|
| 4:41:02| Substitute motion is that we're going to ask for a certified appraisal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16862)|
| 4:41:07| and for the mayor to also come up with a market analysis that meets our guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16867)|
| 4:41:14| our policies, our codes of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16874)|
| 4:41:17| and that we would have three public meetings, one at each of the Hillcrest locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16877)|
| 4:41:26| and the mayor will get that information to us when he can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16886)|
| 4:41:33| And those meetings will be workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16893)|
| 4:41:35| Just a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16895)|
| 4:41:40| Commissioner Wright, do you have something in mind that you'd like to see them be, a workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16900)|
| 4:41:49| Someone would have to facilitate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16909)|
| 4:41:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16913)|
| 4:41:54| And there are questions that even we've brought up tonight that would need to be solved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16914)|
| 4:41:57| So who would you like to be the facilitator of those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16917)|
| 4:42:01| Would you like to be the facilitator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16921)|
| 4:42:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16924)|
| 4:42:07| But I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16927)|
| 4:42:11| Well, what we'll do is we'll allow the ñ how about it, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16931)|
| 4:42:14| If your staff could work out the dates of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16934)|
| 4:42:20| Not on basketball nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16940)|
| 4:42:22| I'm smart enough to know that one myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16942)|
| 4:42:24| I play on many basketball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16944)|
| 4:42:26| What we typically do is we have public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16946)|
| 4:42:28| We have comment cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16948)|
| 4:42:29| People can register opinions online and dialogue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16949)|
| 4:42:34| So we will do it like we conduct our other public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16954)|
| 4:42:37| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16957)|
| 4:42:38| But I'd like ñ if you could handle that for us, we'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16958)|
| 4:42:41| So the mayor will handle that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16961)|
| 4:42:43| Mr. Mayor, can we have something about the ñ I'm sorry, I'm over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16963)|
| 4:42:46| Can we have something about the certificate of need policies with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16966)|
| 4:42:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16970)|
| 4:42:51| I think that's a ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16971)|
| 4:42:52| Clarify that question as we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16972)|
| 4:42:53| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16973)|
| 4:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16974)|
| 4:42:57| Substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16977)|

| 4:43:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16983)|
| 4:43:06| We're going to take a ten-minute break and go into zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=16986)|

| 4:44:54| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17094)|
| 4:45:00| I'm here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17100)|
| 4:45:03| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17103)|
| 4:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17108)|
| 4:45:09| NPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17109)|
| 4:45:12| Mr. Chair, this is a request for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential, both of which have a floodway overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17112)|
| 4:45:21| The request is for plan residential at 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17121)|
| 4:45:26| The NPC considered both a plan amendment and a rezoning for this particular request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17126)|
| 4:45:33| The plan amendment was to change the designation from low-density residential to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17133)|
| 4:45:41| That particular request was denied by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17141)|
| 4:45:45| They did approve plan residential zoning at five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17145)|
| 4:45:50| which is consistent with the existing designation of low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17150)|
| 4:45:57| That was by a vote of ten to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17157)|
| 4:45:59| Property contains almost 23 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17159)|
| 4:46:02| It's located on the southeast side of Dixon Springs Lane, southwest of East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17162)|
| 4:46:08| Access would be via Dixon Springs Lane, a short dead-end local street with 15 to 17 feet of pavement within a 40-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17168)|
| 4:46:15| In looking at the request and the implications of rezoning the property at a higher density than what is allowed under low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17175)|
| 4:46:28| the staff took note of the fact that there is a stream protection area located on the southern end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17188)|
| 4:46:34| That portion of the property is on floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17194)|
| 4:46:38| They also took a look at the surrounding zoning pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17198)|
| 4:46:41| where you had zoning ranging from plan residential at one to four dwelling units per acre to RA zoning to agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17201)|
| 4:46:50| So one might consider this area in a bit of transition where you still have a lot of rural area present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17210)|
| 4:46:59| but you do have some residential development that's almost exclusively low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17219)|
| 4:47:08| The staff, again, did look at the fact that it's affected by a stream protection area and floodway on the southern end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17228)|
| 4:47:15| And because of the fact that the access to the site would not be conducive to medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17235)|
| 4:47:23| the fact that the site had some constraints that we think would be severely impacted by a medium-density residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17243)|
| 4:47:32| at up to 12 dwelling units per acre and looking at the surrounding development pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17252)|
| 4:47:36| which is, as I mentioned, exclusively low-density residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17256)|
| 4:47:42| With those thoughts in mind, and there was opposition, I believe, at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17262)|
| 4:47:48| So with those thoughts in mind, again, the Planning Commission voted to deny the sector plan amendment request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17268)|
| 4:47:54| and approve plan residential at up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17274)|
| 4:48:00| Mr. Seymour, you can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17280)|
| 4:48:04| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17284)|
| 4:48:07| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17287)|
| 4:48:11| Mr. Johnson just gave you the Metropolitan Planning Commission report on this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17291)|
| 4:48:18| Although we respectfully disagreed at the Planning Commission about their recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17298)|
| 4:48:24| we have accepted it now and ask that you approve the recommendation of the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17304)|
| 4:48:32| and the full Planning Commission that this property be zoned from agricultural to plan residential at one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17312)|
| 4:48:41| Let me point out just a couple of things about this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17321)|
| 4:48:45| It is a short distance off Emory Road east of sort of halfway between Norris Freeway and I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17325)|
| 4:48:56| There is a lot that has changed out there in this area that makes this very conducive for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17336)|
| 4:49:04| First, the process of widening Emory Road, which is well underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17344)|
| 4:49:11| It has been widened from I-75 to east of Dry Gap Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17351)|
| 4:49:18| That process continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17358)|
| 4:49:20| This property will be a short distance off a four- to five-lane road very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17360)|
| 4:49:27| The second thing that has had a big impact on the development patterns in the Emory Road area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17367)|
| 4:49:34| is certainly the relocation or location of St. Mary's Hospital north at I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17374)|
| 4:49:42| There is now a huge demand from medical personnel, not only who work at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17382)|
| 4:49:49| but who also work in the doctor's offices, which are going up all around that area, for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17389)|
| 4:49:58| Our proposal, we originally proposed apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17398)|
| 4:50:02| We're reconciled that we're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17402)|
| 4:50:05| But this is in the planned growth area of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17405)|
| 4:50:09| We are asking you not to change the sector plan to leave it for low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17409)|
| 4:50:16| We are simply asking for planned residential at up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17416)|
| 4:50:21| I understand there will be a request that that be three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17421)|
| 4:50:26| We would ask you not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17426)|
| 4:50:29| If you disagree with five units per acre, leave the property at agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17429)|
| 4:50:34| We'll take that and do what we can with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17434)|
| 4:50:37| But we think the opportunity is there to do a nice subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17437)|
| 4:50:43| There will be complaints about Dixon Springs Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17443)|
| 4:50:47| Under the planned residential zone, we anticipate that we would have to bring that up to local street category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17447)|
| 4:50:55| from the entrance to our subdivision out to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17455)|
| 4:50:59| That is not an issue with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17459)|
| 4:51:01| We would be required to do that and would anticipate doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17461)|
| 4:51:07| I will be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17467)|
| 4:51:10| Mr. Fuller, one of the developers, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17470)|
| 4:51:12| If you have any questions for him, I will try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17472)|
| 4:51:16| But we would simply at this point ask that you adopt the MPC recommendation of planned residential at one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17476)|
| 4:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17486)|
| 4:51:28| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17488)|
| 4:51:36| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm John King, PO Box 2425.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17496)|
| 4:51:40| Knoxville, Tennessee 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17500)|
| 4:51:44| I'm here representing as a spokesperson Mr. Bob Cry and a group of property owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17504)|
| 4:51:53| He is serving somewhat as spokesperson of that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17513)|
| 4:51:57| And that is a group of area property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17517)|
| 4:51:59| That includes Mr. Caldwell, who is immediately adjoining this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17519)|
| 4:52:04| Ms. Carter, who also immediately adjoins the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17524)|
| 4:52:08| and Mr. Edmondson, who is directly across Dixon Lane from the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17528)|
| 4:52:14| There was presented as part of the material at MPC a petition with over 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17534)|
| 4:52:20| almost 600 signatures of area residents who opposed the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17540)|
| 4:52:25| And at the time of MPC, that opposition expressed, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17545)|
| 4:52:31| in rather distinct terms its preference that was if the property is to be rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17551)|
| 4:52:38| that they wanted it to be utilized for single family detached residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17558)|
| 4:52:45| not with density, not to exceed three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17565)|
| 4:52:51| The surrounding development is, as noted on the staff report from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17571)|
| 4:52:58| that this site is in a rural residential area that has seen low-density residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17578)|
| 4:53:05| in recent years under RA and PR zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17585)|
| 4:53:09| If you look at the map that's attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17589)|
| 4:53:12| I think you'll find that the closest subdivision that's been recently developed in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17592)|
| 4:53:19| is at one to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17599)|
| 4:53:22| The most dense subdivision development in the area is one that is in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17602)|
| 4:53:28| that would be north of this property, having direct access to Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17608)|
| 4:53:33| and back closer to the intersection of Emory and Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17613)|
| 4:53:38| And it was at one to four, but if you look at how it was in actuality developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17618)|
| 4:53:43| I don't believe it actually plats out to one to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17623)|
| 4:53:47| The predominant development in the area is clearly single family detached, larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17627)|
| 4:53:56| many exceeding one acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17636)|
| 4:53:59| We understand and recognize that development will come and development is to be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17639)|
| 4:54:05| I don't think some of the changes mentioned by Mr. Seymour are changes made in anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17645)|
| 4:54:12| of a bunch more property being zoned for residential at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17652)|
| 4:54:18| The sector plan indicated that in the ten years preceding that particular study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17658)|
| 4:54:27| that the traffic on Emory Road had increased 103%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17667)|
| 4:54:33| And I think the widening of that road was the response to what was already in existence on that road at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17673)|
| 4:54:41| And I mention that because, again, if you look at your map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17681)|
| 4:54:45| there are directly across Dixon Springs Lane is a tract of undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17685)|
| 4:54:53| As I said, it's owned by Mr. Edmondson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17693)|
| 4:54:56| Mr. Caldwell has likewise what I refer to as a very lovely farm that immediately adjoins this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17696)|
| 4:55:04| You add those two pieces together and the piece that's owned by Mrs. Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17704)|
| 4:55:09| you're looking at well in excess of an additional 100 acres of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17709)|
| 4:55:15| that is likely to see pressure for development in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17715)|
| 4:55:20| Setting, if you will, a precedent of five dwelling units per acre on this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17720)|
| 4:55:26| then look at the remaining property in the area yet to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17726)|
| 4:55:30| and add that at five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17730)|
| 4:55:33| you quickly get in excess of 500 and close to 600 new dwelling units in that one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17733)|
| 4:55:41| impacting, if you will, at an already severely impacted infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17741)|
| 4:55:47| predominantly the road system and the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17747)|
| 4:55:51| I know Mr. Crye has talked to representatives of the school system out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17751)|
| 4:55:55| and all of them are at or in excess of capacity currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17755)|
| 4:56:00| And adding this many more residential units simply increases that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17760)|
| 4:56:07| So we ask, as we have asked and said before, that this property, if it's to be rezoned, planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17767)|
| 4:56:16| that it be at no more than three units per acre as being consistent with the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17776)|
| 4:56:22| and consistent, I believe, with good planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17782)|
| 4:56:25| and looking forward into the future at what is likely to be occurring in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17785)|
| 4:56:31| I want to mention one last thing, and I certainly do not ascribe this thought to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17791)|
| 4:56:38| but it's an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17798)|
| 4:56:40| What they're now asking for is five dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17800)|
| 4:56:46| Today, tonight is the first time I've heard Mr. Seymour say that they acknowledge that there will be no apartment development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17806)|
| 4:56:53| I have been told that they are now considering some sort of a condominium development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17813)|
| 4:57:00| As we all know, in a planned residential zone, you can sort of clump your development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17820)|
| 4:57:05| And I would suggest to you that there's always the possibility that what can happen in planned residential is you get your density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17825)|
| 4:57:15| you clump your development, you utilize only a small portion of the developable property to put those units in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17835)|
| 4:57:22| and wait a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17842)|
| 4:57:24| And then you go back and you say this other property that wasn't developed is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17844)|
| 4:57:30| It needs to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17850)|
| 4:57:32| It is unreasonable to expect that there's going to be a single family detached subdivision there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17852)|
| 4:57:38| now that we have a condominium complex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17858)|
| 4:57:41| And what we need is to increase the density on the remaining portion so that we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17861)|
| 4:57:46| and put that property likewise on the tax rolls and put it to some use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17866)|
| 4:57:51| I suggest to you once again that if the planning process is a planned subdivision for detached single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17871)|
| 4:58:02| at three units to the acre, you will therefore adequately and more fully utilize the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17882)|
| 4:58:09| And I suggest to you that that's what ought to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17889)|
| 4:58:15| I mentioned Mr. Cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17895)|
| 4:58:17| He is the person who is a spokesperson for the group that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17897)|
| 4:58:20| I know there are a number of people here, one or more of whom may also wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17900)|
| 4:58:25| I know at least one gentleman has expressed an interest in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17905)|
| 4:58:29| But he developed the subdivision Emory Point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17909)|
| 4:58:32| That's the closest one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17912)|
| 4:58:34| Those are very nicely done homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17914)|
| 4:58:36| Obviously, this is an area that can support nice single family detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17916)|
| 4:58:42| That's what I suggest ought to occur here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17922)|
| 4:58:46| And certainly that particular subdivision, Emory Point, is reflective of what somebody who goes in and does it well can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17926)|
| 4:58:57| As I mentioned, that one was developed at one to two units to the acre, and it's a very nice-looking subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17937)|
| 4:59:04| something that the area residents and property owners would like to see on this page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17944)|
| 4:59:09| Yes, there are some constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17949)|
| 4:59:12| Yes, some of those will have to be dealt with at the development plan stage if they get planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17952)|
| 4:59:21| I suggest to you again that density is an issue that will impact some of those constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17961)|
| 4:59:28| and all the more reason we ought to keep the density at three units to the acre as opposed to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17968)|
| 4:59:34| Therefore, as I say, in being consistent from day one on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17974)|
| 4:59:39| we would ask that if it is to be rezoned to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17979)|
| 4:59:44| that the density be set at no more than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17984)|
| 4:59:50| Mr. Seymour, you have three minutes rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17990)|
| 4:59:54| Your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17994)|
| 4:59:56| He can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17996)|
| 4:59:57| He can talk on the rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17997)|
| 4:59:59| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=17999)|
| 5:00:04| Some reason we've gotten into the habit of saying the density in any new subdivision has to be exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18004)|
| 5:00:14| as any adjoining subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18014)|
| 5:00:17| If you look at subdivisions in the city of Knoxville that have been here a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18017)|
| 5:00:24| Holston Hills, Fountain City, Sequoia Hills, West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18024)|
| 5:00:32| the density within those subdivisions varies widely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18032)|
| 5:00:37| If you go into Holston Hills, there are homes that have several acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18037)|
| 5:00:44| and then homes that are on much smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18044)|
| 5:00:47| I don't quite understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18047)|
| 5:00:49| Also, if you keep the density low where you have good infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18049)|
| 5:00:55| which you do here, sewer, water, all the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18055)|
| 5:00:58| where you have access to a good roadway and keep it low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18058)|
| 5:01:03| you are promoting a situation that is contrary to policies the MPC has adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18063)|
| 5:01:13| this body has adopted, that is promoting urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18073)|
| 5:01:18| You ought to use the land that has the infrastructure and the good roads for higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18078)|
| 5:01:26| Otherwise, although home building is slow now, I anticipate in another couple of years it will return to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18086)|
| 5:01:34| you're going to push it out onto farms further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18094)|
| 5:01:37| This is a farm, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18097)|
| 5:01:38| There are other farms around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18098)|
| 5:01:41| If we don't get one to five, let us just develop it at the agricultural density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18101)|
| 5:01:47| And leave us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18107)|
| 5:01:51| But we think that what MPC has recommended here is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18111)|
| 5:01:57| and would ask you to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18117)|
| 5:02:00| Otherwise, we'll develop it or continue to use it for agricultural purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18120)|
| 5:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18125)|
| 5:02:07| Mr. King, the gentleman can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18127)|
| 5:02:11| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18131)|
| 5:02:13| Mr. Commissioner, I'm Bob Cry, 7339 Emory Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18133)|
| 5:02:18| I'd like to make two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18138)|
| 5:02:20| One is that you have to go many miles to find anything more than three units per acre in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18140)|
| 5:02:29| You cannot find anywhere in the Halls area a development with more than three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18149)|
| 5:02:38| with vacant farmland all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18158)|
| 5:02:43| At the MPC hearing, second point, MPC hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18163)|
| 5:02:46| Commissioner Lara Cole asked the petitioner why there was a need for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18166)|
| 5:02:53| He said that he talked with the HR department at St. Mary's North and with DeRoyal and with Regal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18173)|
| 5:03:00| the three main employers in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18180)|
| 5:03:02| I checked with all three of those HR departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18182)|
| 5:03:05| I've got names and numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18185)|
| 5:03:06| He did not speak with any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18186)|
| 5:03:08| There is no demand out there for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18188)|
| 5:03:12| I'd appreciate you keeping it at one to three or at agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18192)|
| 5:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18197)|
| 5:03:21| Mr. King, are you going to use the rest of the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18201)|
| 5:03:25| Tick, tick, tick, tick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18205)|
| 5:03:34| Thank you for the countdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18214)|
| 5:03:37| If I understood correctly what Mr. Seymour said, he says it's five units per acre or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18217)|
| 5:03:48| We said not more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18228)|
| 5:03:51| If he's saying three is simply unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18231)|
| 5:03:54| and that they would therefore prefer to leave it as agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18234)|
| 5:03:59| then I simply want to say that that is acceptable to us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18239)|
| 5:04:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18257)|
| 5:04:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18260)|
| 5:04:21| I have just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18261)|
| 5:04:23| Mr. King may answer or MPC could answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18263)|
| 5:04:29| The density to the subdivision to the south there of that, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18269)|
| 5:04:36| The RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18276)|
| 5:04:39| LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18279)|
| 5:04:42| Imperial Drive and that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18282)|
| 5:04:45| I forget the name of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18285)|
| 5:04:46| Yeah, it's zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18286)|
| 5:04:48| I don't know what the realized density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18288)|
| 5:04:52| In other words, what the density on the ground is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18292)|
| 5:04:55| Typically, when you have property zoned RA, it's going to be in the neighborhood of two to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18295)|
| 5:05:01| maybe a little bit more than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18301)|
| 5:05:04| But, you know, it could vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18304)|
| 5:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18306)|
| 5:05:07| Second question I have is on the lower part there, it looks like the last two to three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18307)|
| 5:05:12| that where the creek runs through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18312)|
| 5:05:14| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18314)|
| 5:05:15| That's a very large creek, very beautiful creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18315)|
| 5:05:18| Do not want to mess up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18318)|
| 5:05:20| So that concerns me about building on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18320)|
| 5:05:24| Arthur, are they going to build on the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18324)|
| 5:05:26| Are they going to make a bridge over that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18326)|
| 5:05:28| What's their plan with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18328)|
| 5:05:31| Probably can't do anything with that because of Knox County regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18331)|
| 5:05:38| We have discussed perhaps reserving some of that for a greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18338)|
| 5:05:45| We've talked to representatives of Legacy Parks very briefly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18345)|
| 5:05:53| But nothing firm has been decided, but you can't build in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18353)|
| 5:05:57| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18357)|
| 5:06:00| Can't disturb a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18360)|
| 5:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18362)|
| 5:06:04| And that's what concerns me is if you can't build in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18364)|
| 5:06:07| then that's going to push the density even more because they're going to use a full 12 acres to get their density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18367)|
| 5:06:12| if they wanted five, and that's going to cram it up even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18372)|
| 5:06:16| So that's just some thoughts that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18376)|
| 5:06:18| I'll make another comment later, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18378)|
| 5:06:21| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18381)|
| 5:06:24| Yes, I guess this comment would be probably for Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18384)|
| 5:06:31| You said that, you know, you wanted to have five or agriculture, which is basically one to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18391)|
| 5:06:37| You also said that these would be detached family dwellings, which means single-family homes, not condos, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18397)|
| 5:06:46| That's attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18406)|
| 5:06:49| That was, I don't know where that statement came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18409)|
| 5:06:52| I don't recall that in the minutes from the MPC, which I reviewed the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18412)|
| 5:06:57| It could be attached housing, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18417)|
| 5:07:00| Well, then you're going to have to go to clustering, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18420)|
| 5:07:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18424)|
| 5:07:06| Well, that is not ñ when you look at all that area, I'm a little bit familiar with it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18426)|
| 5:07:12| even though I do live on the other end of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18432)|
| 5:07:18| There isn't anything around there but basically a lot of single-family upscale homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18438)|
| 5:07:26| And I think that you would be setting a precedent here, and I think we'd be remiss if we went more than three on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18446)|
| 5:07:34| I mean, if they can do it in Emerald Point or Emory Point or whichever that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18454)|
| 5:07:41| why can't your developer not do the same thing with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18461)|
| 5:07:45| Probably because of land price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18465)|
| 5:07:48| There are condominiums along Emory Road, a number of condominium developments out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18468)|
| 5:07:56| There's some back near Dry Gap Pike, which would be to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18476)|
| 5:08:01| Yeah, far west, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18481)|
| 5:08:03| This is about, I think, a mile and a half off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18483)|
| 5:08:07| I put my clicker on it, but it was a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18487)|
| 5:08:10| A mile and a half from the interstate, there are several condominium developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18490)|
| 5:08:18| Between the interstate and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18498)|
| 5:08:20| Three miles from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18500)|
| 5:08:21| Excuse me, three miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18501)|
| 5:08:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18503)|
| 5:08:24| But there are condominium developments in the area, both on the south and the north side of Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18504)|
| 5:08:30| But in this particular area, though, it's like you're putting a red patch on a blue picture when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18510)|
| 5:08:43| when your basic neighborhood is single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18523)|
| 5:08:47| That's my point I'm trying to get across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18527)|
| 5:08:49| Yeah, and I would tend to disagree with that, that mixed developments do very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18529)|
| 5:08:59| You know, you can cite a number of city subdivisions where there are apartments, condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18539)|
| 5:09:05| commercial and residential, single-family, detached, residential, all clustered together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18545)|
| 5:09:11| If you want to say on Emory Road we're going to keep it, you know, one to three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18551)|
| 5:09:17| I think the plan needs to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18557)|
| 5:09:20| The plan, the sector plan, says that it is for low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18560)|
| 5:09:26| and that is up to five units per acre in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18566)|
| 5:09:33| So, that being said, we have asked for or agreed after MPC shot us down on the other plan to five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18573)|
| 5:09:44| We said, all right, we can run with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18584)|
| 5:09:47| If not, put it back into farming and try to find out who cut the hay on the property the other day because somebody did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18587)|
| 5:09:54| So, in other words, you just have an option on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18594)|
| 5:09:57| He hasn't purchased it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18597)|
| 5:09:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18598)|
| 5:09:59| He has a contract purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18599)|
| 5:10:01| So, if this doesn't fly, then he lets it go back to being a cow pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18601)|
| 5:10:05| Well, yeah, the owner is going to put a fence around it so people can't come in and steal his hay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18605)|
| 5:10:11| but it will go back for the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18611)|
| 5:10:17| You know, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18617)|
| 5:10:18| If you look at your agenda tonight, you've got, what, three zoning requests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18618)|
| 5:10:22| That's probably the smallest you've had in about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18622)|
| 5:10:27| Maybe ten years or even longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18627)|
| 5:10:31| That's reflective of what is going on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18631)|
| 5:10:35| There is apartment development in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18635)|
| 5:10:38| I looked at the building permits for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18638)|
| 5:10:41| The biggest residential permits have been for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18641)|
| 5:10:45| There is commercial development going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18645)|
| 5:10:48| There is very little single-family residential going on, and that will probably continue for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18648)|
| 5:10:56| I don't know whether I've answered your question, Commissioner Brown, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18656)|
| 5:11:01| I sort of rambled there, but that's sort of the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18661)|
| 5:11:06| If you're going to say, all right, we're going to do three units per acre all up and down Emory Road, put it in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18666)|
| 5:11:14| and everybody will come back with three units per acre, and that way you gobble up more farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18674)|
| 5:11:24| If I may, one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18684)|
| 5:11:25| I went out and drove this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18685)|
| 5:11:28| I went on this land with Mr. Cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18688)|
| 5:11:31| I've been there twice since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18691)|
| 5:11:34| I didn't get the hay, and I don't know who did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18694)|
| 5:11:39| But I went back and pulled my notes to make sure I was remembering correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18699)|
| 5:11:45| And driving this area from the commercial node at Emory Road and Dry Gap Pike, where you have Bricky School near I-75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18705)|
| 5:11:54| from there to Emory Road and the Norris Freeway intersection is farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18714)|
| 5:12:00| or single-family detached development except for one small condominium development, Beaver Brook Condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18720)|
| 5:12:12| Seventh District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18732)|
| 5:12:17| Arthur, let me ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18737)|
| 5:12:20| Do you want agriculture or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18740)|
| 5:12:22| Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18742)|
| 5:12:27| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18747)|
| 5:12:29| I'll make a motion that we zone it for agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18749)|
| 5:12:32| Leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18752)|
| 5:12:33| Leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18753)|
| 5:12:34| It's already zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18754)|
| 5:12:36| Leave it as ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18756)|
| 5:12:39| It largely is a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18759)|

| 5:16:06| I would like to nominate Mr. Commissioner, Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18966)|
| 5:16:11| Are these commissioner appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18971)|
| 5:16:14| I think they're citizen appointments, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18974)|
| 5:16:21| I believe they're citizen appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18981)|
| 5:16:29| Maybe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18989)|
| 5:16:31| He needs to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18991)|
| 5:16:32| I'm recommending you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18992)|
| 5:16:34| Paul, could you speak into the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18994)|
| 5:16:38| I'm going to nominate Dr. Briggs for the commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=18998)|
| 5:16:43| We're allowed one commissioner on there, and I'm nominating him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19003)|
| 5:16:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19010)|
| 5:16:53| Then we need two more citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19013)|
| 5:16:57| Then we have, I think, two citizens appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19017)|
| 5:17:00| Is that not correct, Mr. Lockett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19020)|
| 5:17:02| And the mayor has two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19022)|
| 5:17:05| I think the mayor's office has already submitted theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19025)|
| 5:17:08| Then what we need are two citizen members from this body and one commission member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19028)|
| 5:17:15| First, I'd like to, would you, Commissioner Briggs, do you accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19035)|
| 5:17:19| I'll be willing to do it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19039)|

| 5:17:26| Mr. Briggs, I think, had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19046)|
| 5:17:28| Do we have to vote on that first because I have a nomination to make for a citizen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19048)|
| 5:17:32| Well, I want to go ahead and take care of the commission appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19052)|
| 5:17:35| I've got the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19055)|

| 5:17:37| All in favor, do we have any other nominations from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19057)|
| 5:17:42| All in favor for Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19062)|

| 5:18:59| I nominate Tim Witt and Carson Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19139)|
| 5:19:03| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19143)|
| 5:19:05| I looked on the commission forum today before I came over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19145)|
| 5:19:09| and I believe that Commissioner Hammond wanted to propose some changes on the makeup of the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19149)|
| 5:19:15| And on the forum, he said he was going to discuss that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19155)|
| 5:19:18| Does anyone else know anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19158)|
| 5:19:22| No, but Mr. Hammond wasn't at any of the meetings that the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19162)|
| 5:19:30| when they drew these rules up, we had to redraw them twice, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19170)|
| 5:19:33| because we didn't get it before you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19173)|
| 5:19:36| And he wasn't at either meeting, so I don't know what his makeup would have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19176)|
| 5:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19181)|
| 5:19:42| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19182)|
| 5:19:43| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19183)|
| 5:19:45| Commissioner Briggs, we have to decide if he's, because we have a two-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19185)|
| 5:19:51| and a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19191)|
| 5:19:52| Did you want Louis Cosby to be put in the two-year or the three-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19192)|
| 5:19:55| I'd like to nominate him for a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19195)|
| 5:19:57| For the three-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19197)|
| 5:19:58| So now we have a two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19198)|
| 5:20:00| Now all we have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19200)|
| 5:20:01| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19201)|
| 5:20:05| We have Mr. Daly and Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19205)|
| 5:20:10| Could you briefly describe them and tell us about either one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19210)|
| 5:20:16| You want to go first, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19216)|

| 5:26:37| but this has come up twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19597)|
| 5:26:40| and unless it's voted on tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19600)|
| 5:26:42| then you're going to have to vote to extend the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19602)|
| 5:26:50| as it was constituted in August for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19610)|

| 5:27:00| what if they came and spoke at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19620)|

| 5:28:46| Amy is trying to phone in a vote, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19726)|
| 5:28:51| Sorry, no dice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19731)|
| 5:28:55| Mr. Chairman, if...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19735)|
| 5:28:57| I want confirmation of mental capacity as far as...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19737)|
| 5:29:01| Mr. Chairman, if Mr. Brown has talked to his person, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19741)|
| 5:29:06| I have not spoken to Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19746)|
| 5:29:08| But if he has already agreed to accept, then, you know, I will yield to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19748)|
| 5:29:12| Well, I've not spoken to him, and I don't think Mr. Pinkston has either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19752)|
| 5:29:16| But he has always been real active and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19756)|
| 5:29:20| Well, he has said he'd like to serve on some committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19760)|
| 5:29:22| He'd like to serve on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19762)|
| 5:29:23| Committees, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19763)|
| 5:29:24| He didn't specify which committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19764)|
| 5:29:26| Can Larry change his vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19766)|
| 5:29:28| Anyone can change their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19768)|
| 5:29:31| Because it failed again, nine to seven Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19771)|
| 5:29:35| So we went the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19775)|
| 5:29:37| Daly had nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19777)|
| 5:29:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19778)|
| 5:29:40| Does anyone want to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19780)|
| 5:29:43| He's already announced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19783)|
| 5:29:44| We've got to go back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19784)|
| 5:29:45| He did say he would serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19785)|
| 5:29:46| You can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19786)|
| 5:29:48| I want to try one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19788)|
| 5:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19789)|
| 5:29:50| Now, I have a new nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19790)|
| 5:29:51| Can I make another nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19791)|
| 5:29:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19793)|
| 5:29:55| Well, I mean, I don't know either of these guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19795)|
| 5:29:57| and I was going to nominate someone that we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19797)|
| 5:30:00| I believe the nomination has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19800)|
| 5:30:02| It's been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19802)|
| 5:30:03| Yeah, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19803)|
| 5:30:05| Who was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19805)|
| 5:30:10| Unless the chair wants to open up the nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19810)|
| 5:30:12| Nominations have been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19812)|
| 5:30:13| I don't think it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19813)|
| 5:30:15| I was going to suggest William Daniels because we've all worked with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19815)|
| 5:30:18| We all know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19818)|
| 5:30:19| And really, I mean, I'm voting blind for Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19819)|
| 5:30:23| I think I've met him a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19823)|
| 5:30:25| But I just thought it might, that Mr. Daniels might get some more votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19825)|
| 5:30:30| since so many of us have actually worked with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19830)|
| 5:30:33| and we actually know him rather than voting for folks we barely know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19833)|
| 5:30:37| That may work against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19837)|
| 5:30:39| Let's call a vote roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19839)|
| 5:30:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19841)|
| 5:30:42| One more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19842)|
| 5:30:43| I can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19843)|
| 5:30:44| On Witt and Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19844)|

| 5:31:47| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19907)|
| 5:31:48| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19908)|
| 5:31:49| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19909)|
| 5:31:51| Do you want to double their pay since it takes so many votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19911)|
| 5:32:00| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19920)|
| 5:32:03| I didn't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19923)|
| 5:32:04| They voted for Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19924)|
| 5:32:05| Pass over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19925)|
| 5:32:07| Fourteen for Daly, one for Witt, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19927)|
| 5:32:16| And what's the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19936)|
| 5:32:18| Two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19938)|
| 5:32:20| Two years for Mr. Cosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19940)|
| 5:32:28| What do we have next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19948)|
| 5:32:30| 8.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19950)|
| 5:32:34| 8.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19954)|
| 5:32:42| Mr. Chairman, do I have to vote on that as a group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19962)|
| 5:32:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19964)|
| 5:32:46| We need to vote on that as a group, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19966)|
| 5:32:51| We put those individuals in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19971)|
| 5:32:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19973)|
| 5:32:54| I guess we need a motion to approve all of the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19974)|
| 5:32:56| Motion to approve all names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19976)|
| 5:32:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19977)|
| 5:32:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19978)|
| 5:32:59| I move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19979)|
| 5:33:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19980)|
| 5:33:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19981)|
| 5:33:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19982)|
| 5:33:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19983)|
| 5:33:04| 9.08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19984)|
| 5:33:10| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19990)|
| 5:33:13| making an agreement with the City of Knoxville for the rehabilitation of the former Fifth Avenue Motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19993)|
| 5:33:18| into the McMillan Manor Resolution 908.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=19998)|
| 5:33:22| That is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20002)|
| 5:33:23| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20003)|
| 5:33:24| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20004)|
| 5:33:26| Intergovernmental, 6-1, to defer to January and so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20006)|
| 5:33:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20010)|
| 5:33:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20011)|
| 5:33:32| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20012)|
| 5:33:34| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20014)|
| 5:33:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20015)|
| 5:33:36| I only want to make one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20016)|
| 5:33:39| After the last meeting, some people had the misinterpretation of my comments about Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20019)|
| 5:33:46| and that I was against Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20026)|
| 5:33:49| I was not against Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20029)|
| 5:33:51| I was against drawing a two-mile circle around Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20031)|
| 5:33:55| and thereby excluding what might be viable alternatives for this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20035)|
| 5:34:01| I just want to correct the interpretation that some people made of what I may have said at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20041)|
| 5:34:09| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20049)|
| 5:34:12| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20052)|
| 5:34:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20054)|
| 5:34:17| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20057)|
| 5:34:20| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20060)|
| 5:34:21| I will speak against the substitute motion in favor of the original motion to defer for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20061)|
| 5:34:27| was it until January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20067)|
| 5:34:30| Deferring to the January meeting has two advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20070)|
| 5:34:33| One, it places our vote after a workshop on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20073)|
| 5:34:38| which is very useful to our understanding of this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20078)|
| 5:34:41| The second reason is that the law director and I had a very productive meeting discussing the law of radius amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20081)|
| 5:34:48| perimeter amendments, and although we're not quite ready to write a law review article together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20088)|
| 5:34:53| we reached some points of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20093)|
| 5:34:56| and he has said he's going to work on language that will keep us within the law while achieving our legislative objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20096)|
| 5:35:02| So we can also have that item before us if we wish to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20102)|
| 5:35:05| So for those two reasons, I will speak against the immediate vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20105)|
| 5:35:09| and in favor of the deferral to January as the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20109)|
| 5:35:17| Commissioner Briggs was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20117)|
| 5:35:19| Yes, I just wanted to make a statement since I've received several e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20119)|
| 5:35:24| and correspondences from citizens that this is passed through federal money through community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20124)|
| 5:35:32| and it's not really Knox County taxpayers' funds for this because some people have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20132)|
| 5:35:38| let's not spend the taxpayers' money for this, let's spend it for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20138)|
| 5:35:42| But this is really passed through funds, and I just wanted to put that on the record for everyone to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20142)|
| 5:35:48| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20148)|
| 5:35:49| I would like to give John Lawler or David Arning a chance to address us for just a moment about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20149)|
| 5:35:56| either whether we choose to defer it or vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20156)|
| 5:35:59| I would like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20159)|
| 5:36:03| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20163)|
| 5:36:04| John Lawler, 400 Main Street, Director of the Tenure Plan to End Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20164)|
| 5:36:11| I would like to address this idea of or the question why it's important to our office that you vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20171)|
| 5:36:19| These projects are complex in the nature in which the financing is structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20179)|
| 5:36:26| and this piece is important to go ahead and decide upon because two of our sources are investors from the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20186)|
| 5:36:34| that are buying the historic tax credits and the low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20194)|
| 5:36:39| They are going to be prone to make commitments to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20199)|
| 5:36:42| and only when they know the other sources have been secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20202)|
| 5:36:47| And their commitments to buy those tax credits are critical to getting the final transaction closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20207)|
| 5:36:54| So the timing of this is very important to us because we are committed to getting this project completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20214)|
| 5:37:03| and the first step in getting it completed is getting the transaction closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20223)|
| 5:37:07| So the timing of voting on it, the issue of voting on it tonight is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20227)|
| 5:37:14| Secondly, well, I can stop there and then address any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20234)|
| 5:37:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20241)|
| 5:37:22| John, in the intergovernmental, Commissioner Broyles raised some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20242)|
| 5:37:28| and I know you tried to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20248)|
| 5:37:30| Where are you addressing those concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20250)|
| 5:37:33| The concern of the board mix and the radius and all the concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20253)|
| 5:37:39| Well, I think at the intergovernmental, Commissioner Broyles focused in on this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20259)|
| 5:37:44| When you look at the 10-year plan, the recommendations that the group that submitted that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20264)|
| 5:37:51| one of the recommendations was that the advisory board, of which I have, which meets quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20271)|
| 5:37:58| would have neighborhood representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20278)|
| 5:38:00| When you look at that advisory board as it's comprised right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20280)|
| 5:38:04| there is not that neighborhood representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20284)|
| 5:38:07| and Commissioner Broyles said she'd like to see that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20287)|
| 5:38:11| and wanted to defer any action upon this resolution until January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20291)|
| 5:38:15| because she thought it would take that long to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20295)|
| 5:38:18| We have been working with Ed Eckenrod, who is the either he has become president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20298)|
| 5:38:24| or is about to become president of COIN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20304)|
| 5:38:28| and I will meet with him Thursday to discuss two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20308)|
| 5:38:32| One of those things is going to be him submitting a couple of names for the advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20312)|
| 5:38:37| which I would submit to Frank Rothermill, who is the chairman of the advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20317)|
| 5:38:41| who would submit those to the mayor and hopefully get those appointed to the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20321)|
| 5:38:46| So we are on top of that, and we're going to make that happen as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20326)|
| 5:38:50| So, again, waiting until January seems way too lengthy for us on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20330)|
| 5:38:57| The other concern of additional facilities within some distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20337)|
| 5:39:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20344)|
| 5:39:05| I mean, the big issue there, the interest of commission, as I understood it at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20345)|
| 5:39:11| was concentration of services, and that is all taken in the context of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20351)|
| 5:39:19| will be built in order to fulfill the mandate of the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20359)|
| 5:39:24| because permanent supportive housing is the cornerstone strategy for success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20364)|
| 5:39:28| in implementing 10-year plans and ending chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20368)|
| 5:39:33| The concentration of services around Menvilla, we completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20373)|
| 5:39:38| Our commitment is to do what the 10-year plan says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20378)|
| 5:39:41| and that's building permanent supportive housing throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20381)|
| 5:39:49| And our workshop we have scheduled with you and city council on the 11th will work to remind each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20389)|
| 5:39:58| what permanent supportive housing is, how it relates to the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20398)|
| 5:40:02| but most importantly develop a process where we all can come to agreement on what are the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20402)|
| 5:40:08| that are important to you as the commission and important to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20408)|
| 5:40:14| as we look with our development partner to identify suitable sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20414)|
| 5:40:18| for the development of permanent supportive housing throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20418)|
| 5:40:23| So that workshop, I think, is going to scratch the itch that this two-mile radius was trying to scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20423)|
| 5:40:33| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20433)|
| 5:40:37| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20437)|
| 5:40:38| What motion are we discussing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20438)|
| 5:40:40| What is this that's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20440)|
| 5:40:43| With or without an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20443)|
| 5:40:47| As originally worded, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20447)|
| 5:40:49| As originally worded, what we read on the screen when you go look at the resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20449)|
| 5:40:55| Because what I view us doing is something that we did back on Wells Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20455)|
| 5:41:03| We as a commission, we were smart enough to see through the redevelopment rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20463)|
| 5:41:09| and we didn't go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20469)|
| 5:41:11| And I think what's happened right now is that we're talking about flow-through money to Menville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20471)|
| 5:41:16| but we're attaching to it a two-mile radius in last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20476)|
| 5:41:22| and we do not have that attached to it tonight, but maybe we're trying to attach it to it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20482)|
| 5:41:27| or we're trying to defer it until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20487)|
| 5:41:30| I think that if we need to get on with two separate questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20490)|
| 5:41:35| one is the question that's before us as the resolution reads, $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20495)|
| 5:41:41| and the other then we're to discuss at some future date how do we control development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20501)|
| 5:41:50| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20510)|
| 5:41:54| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20514)|
| 5:41:57| in your judgment that the ruling of the two-mile radius would be illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20517)|
| 5:42:02| As the amendment was proposed that was vetoed, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20522)|
| 5:42:09| it was my opinion that that exposed the county to significant liability for a violation of the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20529)|
| 5:42:17| That's why I recommended that the mayor veto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20537)|
| 5:42:21| As Commissioner Harmon stated, he and I met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20541)|
| 5:42:25| We discussed my memo to the mayor, commission, and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20545)|
| 5:42:32| His posting, I must point out for commission's benefit in considering this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20552)|
| 5:42:44| that I made a commitment to Commissioner Harmon if this matter was deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20564)|
| 5:42:51| to look at ways to attempt to address this very issue, and I'll stand by that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20571)|
| 5:43:00| You know, if this resolution is voted on and passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20580)|
| 5:43:05| then this body can still do that and I'll make that same commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20585)|
| 5:43:13| My concern as the law director is that the county not do something that violates the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20593)|
| 5:43:19| that could subject the county to not only ridicule for having violated the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20599)|
| 5:43:30| but substantial monetary penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20610)|
| 5:43:33| One of the sites that Commissioner Harmon can put into his memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20613)|
| 5:43:41| the Tracy P. versus Sarasota County case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20621)|
| 5:43:46| was actually a case where Sarasota County had similar restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20626)|
| 5:43:53| Theirs was not a circular radius, but this type of housing had to be spaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20633)|
| 5:44:01| It had to be 1,000 feet between each unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20641)|
| 5:44:06| and a group of residents sued saying that it violated the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20646)|
| 5:44:14| The county filed a motion to try to get that case dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20654)|
| 5:44:19| and the court refused to dismiss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20659)|
| 5:44:23| and in its opinion, refusing to dismiss the county's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20663)|
| 5:44:27| made some pretty strong statements to the effect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20667)|
| 5:44:31| and discussed why it was refusing to dismiss the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20671)|
| 5:44:37| intimated that the county had problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20677)|
| 5:44:40| Sarasota County ended up entering into an agreed dismissal of the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20680)|
| 5:44:48| but to get it dismissed, Sarasota County had to pay three-quarters of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20688)|
| 5:44:54| They had to pay $750,000 and agree to training on how to abide by the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20694)|
| 5:45:03| So that's what I want us to avoid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20703)|
| 5:45:07| and I think we can do that working with Mr. Lawler, this commission, city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20707)|
| 5:45:18| I think we can all sit down and do the things that need to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20718)|
| 5:45:24| You finished, Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20724)|
| 5:45:26| Just a quick reference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20726)|
| 5:45:27| I just heard from my hospitalized colleague, and she will never forgive John Lawler, her words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20727)|
| 5:45:34| if he pushes through this plan with none of these things actually being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20734)|
| 5:45:38| and him just pledging to commit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20738)|
| 5:45:40| We've heard pledges before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20740)|
| 5:45:42| Their communities have had words before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20742)|
| 5:45:44| We want things in contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20744)|
| 5:45:45| We want things in paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20745)|
| 5:45:46| We want things in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20746)|
| 5:45:48| If you want to rush this, if you want to say vote on it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20748)|
| 5:45:53| then we're happy to vote no because I'm not sure my community believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20753)|
| 5:45:57| we need to spend $7 million in four years to house 57 homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20757)|
| 5:46:02| We can do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20762)|
| 5:46:03| We can do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20763)|
| 5:46:04| So if you're going to push for it, then I would recommend a push for a vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20764)|
| 5:46:07| and I would vote no, and I recommend others to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20767)|
| 5:46:11| Trying to force this issue when this body has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20771)|
| 5:46:16| and the interest to look at alternatives and to hold hearings and to do what's right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20776)|
| 5:46:21| if you want to force the issue, then the vote should be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20781)|
| 5:46:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20785)|
| 5:46:26| Mr. Lawler, as we move forward, if this is approved tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20786)|
| 5:46:32| you'll have to bring before us any plan that you have to do this anywhere else in the county, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20792)|
| 5:46:39| I mean, if you're planning on, if it doesn't involve money and maybe a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20799)|
| 5:46:45| how are we going to know that you're keeping your commitment to the plan, I guess, is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20805)|
| 5:46:50| Well, I think critical to that is for us, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20810)|
| 5:46:53| coming up with some criteria that we both agree on that are legitimate criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20813)|
| 5:46:58| that our development partner can use when he is looking for a suitable site for the next development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20818)|
| 5:47:05| Legitimate criteria for us are going to have to do with what kind of sites help make permanent supportive housing successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20825)|
| 5:47:13| And legitimate criteria from a commissioner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20833)|
| 5:47:17| or a city councilman's person's perspective is going to be where can these things be sited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20837)|
| 5:47:24| and it makes sense for my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20844)|
| 5:47:26| So we need to have those conversations and that's what this process is going to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20846)|
| 5:47:31| Other communities have been successful coming up with those criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20851)|
| 5:47:35| and I think we can do the same thing here so that every time one of these comes to the forefront for funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20855)|
| 5:47:41| we're not having a contentious discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20861)|
| 5:47:48| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20868)|
| 5:47:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20870)|
| 5:47:54| Mr. Lawler, is it a requirement that you have someone representing the community in a defined way on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20874)|
| 5:48:08| or is it a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20888)|
| 5:48:11| It is a recommendation from the people who put together the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20891)|
| 5:48:15| The advisory board was something that was constituted before I stepped in to this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20895)|
| 5:48:21| Frank Rothermelf with Denark Incorporated is the chairman of that advisory board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20901)|
| 5:48:28| and I report in to them on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20908)|
| 5:48:32| So it was put into place and it was a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20912)|
| 5:48:36| and why it was constituted the way it was originally I'm sure was influenced by the criteria of that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20916)|
| 5:48:44| but why neighborhood representation might have been missing I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20924)|
| 5:48:49| Okay, I mean that just seems to be critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20929)|
| 5:48:52| It seems to make a lot of sense, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20932)|
| 5:48:55| And we think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20935)|
| 5:48:56| Yeah, and the fact that this didn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20936)|
| 5:48:59| and we're looking at a recommendation I guess troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20939)|
| 5:49:03| But I guess my final point is are you saying that this deal will fall through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20943)|
| 5:49:12| if we don't allow time for a public hearing and then a vote in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20952)|
| 5:49:17| Is that what you're saying that your key financial pieces of it will fall through if we don't act on this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20957)|
| 5:49:24| No, I didn't say that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20964)|
| 5:49:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20966)|
| 5:49:27| So in terms of so we could we probably will still have a deal if we defer this until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081117?start=20967)|
