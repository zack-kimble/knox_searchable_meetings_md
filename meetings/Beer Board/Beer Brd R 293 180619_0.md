| 0:08:09| Okay. Before us tonight is an administrative hearing of Paul's Oasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=489)|
| 0:08:19| Paul Osterbring for Paul's Oasis, 8021 Kingston Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| So here's where we are today is that in May of 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| cited for sale to a minor was first in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| 531, two weeks later, remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| February of 18, cited for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| 220 of 18, we received a revised remedial plan and a $500 bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| Administrative hearing was held on February 27, resulting in no further action being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| Then 514.18, notice of agreed order, TABC received notice and hearing set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| and notice of TABC hearing receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| So you've been through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| You tell us what you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| You had a five-day suspension in there from TABC, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| You paid a $500 fine and a five-day suspension for TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| So our choices here, Mr. Frost, are to accept what has been done or to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Send them to the beer board hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| So do you all understand what our?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Any questions or any comments for Paul's Oasis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| Mr. Chairman, just this is the same issue that was raised previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=586)|
| 0:09:53| that we dealt with on February 27 and took no action on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| The only difference is we're seeing this applicant come back for this hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| because it went through the state process, and so we get it sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| I'm sure Mr. Frost will correct me if I've misstated that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| But this is the same issue, so I think we just continue to take no action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| He's already paid his fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| He's already taken his five-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| I'm not sure why we would take action on the same issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| The state law provides that if the TABC acts, even if the local body has acted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=627)|
| 0:10:33| it has to come back to the local body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| So it used to be that if the state imposed a suspension for a certain period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| that the local governments were required to match that suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| That provision of the law has sunset a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| so it's within the discretion of the beer board to do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| or send the business on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| So we do not need a motion unless there's further discussion to pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| There being no motion, then, Paul, good luck and be careful out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| We're trying. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Next up is Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| You can give us some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| So a resolution before the beer board to adopt revised terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| for a special event permit at Chilhowee Park in accordance with the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| for Article 2, Division 2, Section 476.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| So where are we, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| The fair is interested in being able to sell beer at the action sports arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| and for those of you attending the fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| that's generally where the demolition derby and the tractor pull are held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| This beer permit is different from your typical beer permit for a convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| or a grocery store or a restaurant, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| So this is something that we have terms and conditions for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| The proposed terms and conditions merely adds the action sports arena to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| where beer may be served by the fair during the time that the fair is held in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=737)|
| 0:12:30| Okay. Do we need a motion to approve that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Now, someone needs to substitute the corrected terms and conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| and then after that, that's motion, second, voted on, and then voted on with a substitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=773)|
| 0:13:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I'll make a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| To implement the substitution terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Do we have it the way you want it, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| I think we have to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Now you want to vote on it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| As amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| So we're voting on it as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Move to approve as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Now do we have it the way you want it, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| And the last thing is, we sent out, Andrew actually sent out, through Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| sent some verbiage on what might be considered in a draft server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| So do you want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Sure, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| I had noticed in, I think we all had noticed in some of our recent meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| there had been a lot of confusion on the part of applicants about what they needed in server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| what is a server compliance plan, and what information should be contained in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| The intent of the draft was for us to have a discussion about server compliance plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| and what we would, what elements we thought should be in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Basically, underlying that is making sure that folks that are applying for beer permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| think in advance about the ways they want to prevent underage alcohol sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| and prevent over-serving customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| The hope would be that in going through this thought process and putting this down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| and creating their server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| we can lessen the instances of these that we have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| The guidelines that got put together are meant to give some guidance to the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| to review some elements that they may or may not want to include in their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| The guidelines are really just intended to assist that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and give them some examples they can look at and use in making their own choices to what they put in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=905)|
| 0:15:15| I think we had to be careful about having a checklist where you've got to do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| It's more meant as a guideline for folks to read through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| Hopefully, you all had a chance to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Really, the intent was, Mr. Chairman, just to have a discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| and see if this is a good approach and make some changes if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Because it's difficult for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| We require that they submit a compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| but there's really no basis for which we can deny it or approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| In fact, we don't have any guidelines for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| We've noticed that in our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| We've had several different types of permits that have been brought before us and discussion about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| well, with your unique circumstance, maybe you need to beef this up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| We need to see something different in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| That's not really fair from our perspective on the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| because they have nothing to guide them in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| That was the hope, was that this would help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you for putting this together, first of all, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| So will this then be used as our official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| I mean, I heard we need some criteria for figuring out whether to accept or decline a server compliance plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=987)|
| 0:16:36| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Can we use this to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| I guess that's more of a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| We can add something to the application form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| which will then have to be adopted by the beer board in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1004)|
| 0:16:51| And also the Metropolitan Drug Commission also did put some elements together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| which is being mailed out to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Different types of permits have different types of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| You know, a restaurant is going to be different from a convenience store and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| So, you know, the idea is to kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| for the applicant to prime the pump of thinking about what they can and should consider doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| There are also differences between a mom-and-pop convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| and, you know, the amount of funds they have versus a multi-state chain of convenience stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| and what they're able to do with their purchasing power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| So it's to help guide, but we don't want to, it's not a mandatory element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| We don't want to stifle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| If someone has a great idea how to stop it, we don't want to stifle creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| We just want to get people thinking before they start selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1065)|
| 0:17:53| Right. Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| And I guess my question is, is this going to be required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| I mean, if it hasn't been submitted, can it be submitted, you know, pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Can we approve it pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| And I think it would be okay, or at least if they're here, have them fill it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| because one of the things we've wrestled on the billboard is, you know, different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| There's always going to be a situation where somebody hasn't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| It's the last minute and it's an event, you know, and it really does put us in a bind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| if we have to call a special meeting so we can review that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| But is that what you were thinking in terms of just that it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| that the real purpose of this is just to get them thinking rather than the actual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| than us evaluating the actual plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| Well, I think we could consider both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| But what I've, you know, seen us doing in our meetings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| when somebody doesn't have a server compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| or maybe it's not detailed enough for us to feel comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| typically what happens is we ask them a question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Could you give us some more detail about what you were planning on doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| And they verbalize that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| I think going along with what Mr. Frost was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| really this is meant to be an exercise and a thought about what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| And maybe if there's, you know, some thought about it on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| before the permit is issued that we won't have as much problems, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| going forward with, you know, the issues that we're trying to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| I'm open to whatever, but I guess the way I had written it was more it was guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| not a requirement that you had to go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| But I would suggest that if we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| I would agree with that approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Well, and certainly if we have somebody that didn't have their server compliance plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| we now have guidelines that they would have seen in their packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and we can say, well, can you maybe talk to us about these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And instead of putting somebody on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| where they have no idea what they're going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| they can look down and look at what's in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| and maybe have something constructive to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Donna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| So we have two different documents here that we're considering a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| One's a series of questions and one's a set of guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| Are we saying that these would move forward and work in tandem together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| or are we talking about adopting one of them as part of the application packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| So the one with questions came from the Metropolitan Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| As some of their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| There's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Roberto sent in his, and then they sent in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| So it's kind of two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| So it's required now that they submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| We've gotten them all over the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| The conflict is that it puts the office, it puts Mark Byrd in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| It's not detailed enough, and they can't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| You don't want to read...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| It's subjectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| We are interested in checking a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| So the subjectivity is up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| So for the board to decide, is this an adequate plan or not an adequate plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| our purview would really be to say, is this plan submitted or is the plan not submitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| So that's all we would supply to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| So the adequacy would be decided by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| So when would they get this, the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| If we adopt something, when would they get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| It would be posted on the city's website where you go to apply for beer permits or Ms. Dyer's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| We could include it as part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I mean, now they get information about their background check and whatever in the beer permit packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| We could include it as a separate, you know, addendum to the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| It's certainly how we would react, however you would like us to do as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| I mean, there's an option to blend the two things together and come up with one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| but it ultimately gets adopted by the beer board to become part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| So is there anything in there, if you read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| is there anything in there that you think ought to be included that is not, or do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| Is there something in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Oh, I'm just listening to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| I mean, it certainly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I'm sorry, I'm leaning on my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| I mean, if you wanted to include it as a separate documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| on your checklist it says you have to serve a compliance plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and a note there that says guidelines are available if requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| and we would have those guidelines available to hand out for those that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| I'd just make it part of the plan and give it to them whether they ask it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah, certainly we can do however you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Mr. Chairman, that was really my thought too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| have it both on the website but then included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| It's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| They're looking to check it off that they've submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| We're looking for it to have some data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I mean, so I guess the question is, is there enough here when you read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| You all have read more of them than most of us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I found it rather complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Which version, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| So which one did you find complete or do you think they need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| It depends on what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Are you looking for them to answer those questions or any set of questions to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| or are you looking to say to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| these are the things we want you to think about and now come up with your own plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| So kind of one is a fill in the blank or one is a do it on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| I don't know, I'll speak for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| but I think I was trying to give them suggestions of which to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| and let them write their own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| They need to own their own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Sergeant Coward, do you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Well, and Mr. Frost touched on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| With the different kind of permits and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| the folks who have the off-premise permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| their plan could be something as simple as we will card everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| because by state law that's the requirement they have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| and their compliance complaint would be just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1453)|
| 0:24:22| They wouldn't necessarily have to answer all the other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| They may not have a policy for catching fake IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| They may just card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And we're aware of that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| So I do have a question now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| So as it relates to the questionnaire, I do like this as a guideline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and I think that it would be good to say that we would like for them to fill this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| as a guideline to think about as they move forward with their billboard application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| as it relates to what is their server compliance going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And I think a lot, because we've seen people show up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| who seem to be not very sure what that's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| And my thing is this, even if it is just as simple as, oh, we're going to card everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| well, do you have some documentation where every employee has signed off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| saying that you've reviewed that level of information with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Because I do think that this is, as it relates to the underage, that it is very loose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| and I think we need to have a little bit tighter accountability on people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| that are serving and selling alcohol and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| So you like the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| You may even like some of the questions that have been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I like the questions, but I think that we would need to add some verbiage here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| to maybe say please fill out this questionnaire to serve as a guideline, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| So do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| The one on the back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Twenty-nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| So you've got them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Well, we're not going to vote on it tonight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| We're just here to talk about it and if there are any other comments about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| If you think of anything that you think ought to be in there that's not in there, you know, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| then we'll probably come back with a next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| You have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| No, Mr. Chairman, I was just going to say that I guess the basic idea was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| that we weren't giving them something to check off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| It was more a thought process because I think you had mentioned earlier having some ownership in their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| and I would worry a little bit that if it's just questions and they check a box and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| yes, I'm going to do this, no, I'm not going to do that, there's not a lot of thought that went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| We're trying to get them to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| That's kind of the, but anyway, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Any other comments or questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| Am I blending the two things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| No, you don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| This is the informal hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| So we're going to discuss this again at our next beer board meeting in a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293180619?start=1623)|
