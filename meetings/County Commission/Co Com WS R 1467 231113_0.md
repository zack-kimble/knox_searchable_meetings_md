| 0:08:24| One thing that we are promising the kids is because this is an opportunity for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| talk to your policy makers, talk to our policy makers, talk to their leaders, their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=510)|

| 0:08:41| and to voice solutions that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| What we're going to do as our volunteers are collecting data or as they're judging, scoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| those essays, we're going to collect data and then turn that into a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| What type of violence are they talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| Are they talking about any solutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Are there any trends that we should take note of as a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| The national organization shares a story from another city where their city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| is reading the essays and they notice a trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| A lot of the students said, if there was more lighting in this area of town on my street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| I would feel safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| And so the city council pretty much immediately approved for funding to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| And so those kids got to see the impact that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| And so I'd really like for us to see that here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| And so I wanted to, one, let you know about the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=569)|

| 0:09:41| But I wanted to let you guys know about it to ask for your support to help spread the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=581)|

| 0:11:00| We have two people signed up to speak directly to agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| The first one is Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| If you would introduce yourself, please, and give your county of residence, and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Put simply, AMR and this administration have put you in a no-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| You have no other option but to approve this contract, as is, with no changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| The level of service laid out in this contract is inadequate, but the possibility of us going with no contract at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| those consequences would be severely worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| You should consider the approval of this contract as a failure of this county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| When people have heart attacks, they should be able to rely on ambulance services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| When parents have one of their children hurt, they should have confidence dialing 911 that they're going to receive an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=711)|
| 0:12:01| I had a stroke on October 8th due to a blood clot at the base of my brain stem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| I spent the entire night so dizzy I couldn't walk the 10 feet from my bed to my bathroom to vomit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| I slept fully dressed in case I had to call one of my neighbors to drive me to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Not once in that evening did I consider calling 911 because I was not confident at all that an ambulance would show up in time to make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=740)|
| 0:12:32| Despite my health care costs being covered 100% by the VA, I was in fear that my family would incur a crippling debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=752)|
| 0:12:44| This is the perception of ambulance services in Knox County right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| A basic life-saving service is no longer a reliable option for even me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=768)|
| 0:12:55| a politically connected, relatively wealthy man that lives three miles from the building we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| While I encourage you to approve this contract now, you must consider this a short-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| Over the next two years, you better come up with a long-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Here's a hint. When you're putting the lives of our citizens in a for-profit entity that maximizes their margins by lowering their costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=795)|
| 0:13:27| the people that are going to suffer the most are the people you serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| AMR stated that the problem isn't understaffing, it's overutilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| I am an example that that is plainly not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| That's the language used by people that refuse to accept responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| The problem is absurdly low pay for our EMTs, our paramedics, and our nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| It is a whole system problem, but AMR can be part of the solution by paying a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| However, they've demonstrated over and over again over the last several years that they're not willing to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| and so we need to figure out a different partner or do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| Thank you. Our next speaker is Alyssa Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| If you'd come forward, please state your name and county of residence. You'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| My name is Alyssa Lewis. I am a Knox County resident. I live in the east side of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| I've been a member of this community since birth. I've also worked in EMS for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| I've worked for priority. I've worked for AMR, Union County, and Granger County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| I come to you today to give you my unbiased opinion and facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| In my time at AMR, I've seen their numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| They don't have the employees to staff the trucks that this county needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Instead, they're moving people from other states, other agencies, to help cover it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| Most of their upper management are transplants from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| They don't know the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| They don't have the love for this community that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| AMR does not pay a livable wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| When I was there in April of this year, I was offered $14.48 an hour with years of 9-1-1 experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| The only way to pay bills was to work an obscene amount of overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| generally the excess of 72 to 120 hours a week, running nonstop for 14 to 24 hours, depending on your shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=922)|
| 0:15:32| When you report a safety issue to a supervisor and make a formal written incident report on a long-standing employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| you get silently fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Commissioners, I ask you, what is stopping them from packing up and leaving the county without an ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| just like they did in the 90s to Union County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| But the question ultimately is, who is capable of taking care of our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| We all make mistakes. None of us are perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| But right now, it's about who is responsible and thrived during the most difficult time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| while still providing care for our families, friends, and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Words are just words, but actions speak louder than any words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| I do believe if you take a step back and take a good look, it's obvious who the best choice would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| I hope you have the wisdom to do what is best and take the road less traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=979)|

| 0:17:46| Item number five is consideration of the closure of a portion of Old Dandridge Stage Coach Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1066)|
| 0:17:52| located in District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| The proposed new terminus will be approximately 25 feet northeast of the southernmost intersecting corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| between property now belonging to Pierce, parcel ID 097-168,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1080)|

| 0:18:12| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| A motion to approve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1097)|

| 0:18:22| Motion by Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Commissioner Beeler, would you like to address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| This, of course, is a first reading because it's a road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| I mean, we can certainly make it without recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| but we'll have another month to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| But this is a dead-end road in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| It terminates well into private property and leads to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1127)|
| 0:18:56| And as such, the last, gosh, I don't know the distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| but the last several hundred yards of this road have just drawn people for nefarious purposes for some time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| I would encourage you to go out and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| It is definitely not maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| You would not want to drive a normal vehicle on a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| And having seen the road, I know Commissioner Frazier's been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Commissioner Jay's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1169)|

| 0:21:56| Term expires September 30, 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1316)|

| 0:22:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| I'm sure Commissioner Daly can relate to this since we were the inaugural class of citizens that began service on the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1341)|
| 0:22:31| So I guess the quick question is how long has Mr. Lovingood resided in District 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1351)|
| 0:22:40| I believe he bought his house after college and before he got married in District 4, so probably three, four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| Actually, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| He was living there during college, so probably six or seven years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| And then with his new – well, let me back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| One of the kind of prerequisites for BZA is to basically, unless you're sick, attend all of the monthly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1380)|
| 0:23:09| With his new out-of-state employment, will that jeopardize that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| He's no longer out-of-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| He's in-state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| He just switched jobs last week and took over as – I think his title's like president of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| He works in payment processing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| So he won't be in D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| As Commissioner Schoonmaker said, I think it was 2009 or 2011, I can't remember, when we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| And I think things are getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| I watched the Board of Zoning Appeals, and it got to the point there a couple years ago that they were proving everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| Being the Board of Zoning Appeals is narrowly focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| There's only certain reasons that you can grant a variance, and those reasons are in our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| And it's gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Law Director Moyers, are they still doing the training before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| When we have time, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| So there's training that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Some of the things that come before the Board of Zoning Appeals is I want to build a bigger bedroom just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| That's not a reason for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| A property owner or a developer cannot create their own variances because they want to have a bigger house on a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1478)|
| 0:24:47| and they need a variance to build a three-car garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| This did pass, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| A three-car garage just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| So they granted a variance, and there was no reason, in my opinion, to grant that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| So it's very important that when we appoint someone to Board of Zoning Appeals, they are a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| They've got a black robo, and they've got to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| It's there, and I hope we never get sued on one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| well, I want a bigger bedroom, and okay, go ahead and do it, or whatever, garage, or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| because I actually didn't sleep at holiday inn, but I don't think we would win that case in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So just keep in mind that in the future, that when we do appoint, that they are judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| They have strict rules that they have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| I cannot talk to my BZA person, and I don't talk to my BZA person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| And I see him at homeowners meetings and other events or whatever, but I don't talk about anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| So they're a judge, and they have to be a judge, and our citizens can call me or call us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| and we can answer questions, but a BZA member cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| So just keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I just want to say that to me it is an important, important position to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| and hopefully that with the leadership of my former chancellor, now law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| that we can keep it focused on what a true variance really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1583)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you. Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1590)|
| 0:26:44| On Riley's resume, it said he was a professional football player. Is he currently playing football?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Okay. So that wasn't correct then. He's not playing in Canada or anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| No, he was playing football. I believe he's done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| So now he's taking this new position, but he hasn't been playing since the summer, I believe, was his last game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| So I asked him, and he said football will not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| His priority is this new company that he's running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| It was Pittsburgh, I believe, outside of Pittsburgh, not in Canada, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1636)|

| 0:28:36| that she would like to speak to this, so I'm going to give her time to address the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| and then we'll go to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Say your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| Janet Testerman, 3201 Division Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you, Madam Chair, and good afternoon, members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you for your consideration of this important agreement for Young-Williams Animal Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| to assume the responsibilities of animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| This transition is designed to consolidate city and county animal control services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| under the operations of Young-Williams Animal Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| who currently holds the municipal sheltering contract of both governmental agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| and has for nearly 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| The opportunity for Young-Williams to bring animal control under its purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| would be a win-win for not only Young-Williams, the city, and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| but also for the pets and the pet owners of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| When it comes to the scope of animal welfare responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| animal control duties are the only pieces of the animal welfare pie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| that Young-Williams does not currently manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| specifically apprehending lost and stray animals, answering complaints regarding animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| pursuing cruelty, neglect, and hoarding cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| But by consolidating the functions of three agencies under one operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| the community would benefit from a shared set of goals and objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| to provide a united, cohesive, and best practice approach to animal and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| that are based on training strategies that have proven to be successful across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| We are not recreating the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Each of you received a recommendation from the National Animal Care and Control Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| advocating for consolidation based on increased efficiency, continuum of comprehensive care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| consistent messaging and community engagement, enhanced collaboration with our shelter team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| and an effective unified advocacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| For the Sheriff's Office, this move would eliminate animal-related complaint calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| create an opportunity to add manpower to other understaffed areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| and reallocate savings to resources specific to protecting our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| It is much easier to bring an animal into the shelter than to keep it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| That's why the goal is to provide city and county residents with a community-minded approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| to animal control services that proactively helps pet owners be responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| helps them come into compliance of local ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and provides needed resources to keep pets in their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| This must include a paradigm shift from the collection of animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| to the prevention of animals coming into the shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| That paradigm shift is accomplished by moving from sight and seize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| to the core values of educate and assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Animal control then becomes one voice in the field with the shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| and we're all solving problems on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| What we do know is compliance goes up with community-based models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| versus a lack of continuity, which results in more complaints and conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| and at the end of the day, one goal will be to decrease citizen complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| Young-Williams has already become a national model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| with our save rate and innovative programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| which is why we want to assume the remaining piece of the animal welfare pie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| so we can be a full-service national model and a humane city that gets it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| It is Young-Williams' goal by consolidating the management of animal control service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| of Knoxville and Knox County that our commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| an innovative, progressive approach to quality, comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| and consistent programs and services would showcase us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| as an even more valuable community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Our desire to promote animal and public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| while also building robust educational outreach, emergency response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| disaster planning, and a healthier, more humane community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| would benefit all citizens and pets, and at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| we are invested in creating Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| as one of our country's pet-friendliest cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| and fulfilling our mission of a home for every pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| I do support our officers not having to go out on these type cases, dog barking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| but I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Any complaints with Young-Williams, is it going to be directed towards you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| or will that go to the sheriff and then where is the accountability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, ideally, being the designated department on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| we would prefer any complaints come to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| so we can run intervention and mitigate any of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Hello, Mr. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I'm doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Walk me through the transfer of responsibilities first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| and then also walk me through the training process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| for those officers who will be the new animal control officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| So the stated transition date would be April 1st, so needed a runway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| That's still a very short period of time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| but I go back to we're not recreating the wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| and have consulted with my peers across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| and those shelters that do oversee animal control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| which several in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So that said, I mean, we would obviously need to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Any officers with both city and county would be welcome to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| for their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| But to that point, we would maintain the same number of personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| which is 17, to run this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| We would staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| We would train both NACA, the National Animal Care and Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| training modules, our individuals who go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| But as far as a training and learning and development budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| I mean, that is built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| We want to set this program up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| As well, Young Williams is fortunate to have relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| with national organizations that also have field training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| that would actually come in, boots on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| help train our officers in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| again, with this community-based model in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Some of these members of the animal welfare agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| are also members of the NACA National Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| So I think we're fortunate to have those relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| who have been part of this process with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Would you also walk me through a call coming in through dispatch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| just kind of the steps that follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| So virtually the transition would be seamless as far as the responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| So 911 would still handle the dispatch of calls at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| And so they would be dispatched virtually city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| but the officers under that would respond just as they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| And so, you know, be it whatever the instance may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| I mean, we're taking in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| animal control brings us about 30% of our animals a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| And so out of our 11,294, we took in 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| So we're taking these animals anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| so once they come in from the transport process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| But we would respond just as animal control now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| and assess the situation, determine what the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| how do we get them in compliance, how do we provide resources if needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| and then holding pet owners accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| So should it be elevated to a criminal offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| then we have an established liaison with either the sheriff's office or KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| who we would then reach out to to help investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and navigate that criminal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Will the officers carry any sort of safety devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| or anything for self-defense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| They will have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I mean, they won't be bonded to carry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| But city officers are not at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| So as part of the training process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| I mean, that would be part of some of the NACA training that is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| There are also some other, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| there are agencies out there that train, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| security personnel with different private sector individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| So they go through certain training as far as how to use pepper spray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| or those types of agents for self-defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| So we certainly want our team to be certainly safe and feel secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| Yes, and I'm so glad to hear that there will be robust training for these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Having been mauled by a dog at the age of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| I understand that it can be a very aggressive and dangerous situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| when you do have an animal that is attacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| So, of course, those officers and their safety are very important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So thank you for paying close attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| I was looking over some old documents from a May 2016 County Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| that I attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| and I noticed that we had approved a defined services contract for young Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| that began on July 1, 2016 and ran through June 30, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| Was that just a one-year test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| or did we extend that further than the 2017 period at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| before it went back to the Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| I'm assuming that was for the defined services contract for our sheltering agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| We did at one time oversee county animal control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| That was under the Health Department, but that was prior to 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| So I'm assuming that's the sheltering contract you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Great. Thank you. I knew you'd know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Hello, Janet. How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| We keep saying to hear the word officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Are we talking about KPD and KCSO officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| or are we just talking about your employees, which will not be officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| Field service personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Okay. That's not officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Not sworn officers, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I just want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| They're not officers from KPD or KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Although I will say that KPD is referred to as officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| However, they are civilian employees and not bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| So I guess universally that's kind of been the term, but field services personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| What is your staff now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Yeah, number. Staff number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| And 17, are you expecting 17 new hires for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| Seeing no more lights, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| We have a proper motion and second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2427)|

| 0:40:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2433)|

| 0:40:39| Item number 50 is Ordinance O-23-11-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| amending the Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Article 2, Animal Control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2446)|

| 0:40:54| to amend the definition of animal control officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2454)|

| 0:41:41| We are on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| There's a motion on the floor by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| second by Commissioner Lee to move forward with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| Is there any more questions or discussions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| Seeing no, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| I guess, does the sheriff, since he's the, have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2530)|
| 0:42:22| Thomas Wagner, Knox County Sheriff, not Nick McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| To be fair to the chair, that last row, it's so dark, you can't tell who it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| We can't even tell that's Chris Caldwell standing back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| I'll remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| So, if the contract with Young-Williams doesn't take effect until April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| should there be a date that this ordinance takes effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Should it take effect like March 1st or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| I'm going to let the gentleman to your left answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| The ordinance just adds language to the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| It does not substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| So, it would provide that any person who's employed by the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| could be an animal control officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| or any person who is employed in that position by a third party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| So, I think it can go into effect immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| without affecting how things are being done at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| Thanks, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2605)|

| 0:43:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2619)|

| 0:44:15| Is there any discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2655)|
| 0:44:25| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Just a couple of clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| I know at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| this commission body had several recommendations, suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| that we were hoping that the review committee would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| because I was told they could negotiate on our behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| if we wanted to see any amendments or tweaks to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| That would be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| I'm not aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| I asked about at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| commission as a body had some recommendations or suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| for consideration by the review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| that could act on behalf of the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| when we were negotiating the actual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| Is that still correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Now that the contract has been bid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and certain requirements were set forth by the purchasing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| I do not believe that amendments would be in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| because if you change the rules that everybody was using to bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| then suddenly it kind of throws all the bids out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| One of the other bidders might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| well, I could have done that for cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| So I think the duty of the body is to approve or disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| If you disapprove, you can make suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| and the mayor can take those on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| if and when he relets the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| But I don't believe that the commission can amend the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| in a fashion that would be fair to all the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| that took part in the bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Well, I knew the commission could not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| but it was explained to me that if we had suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| or recommendations that we would like to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| that the review committee could consider those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| and act on our behalf in negotiating with the service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| If there are further negotiations to take part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| then I suppose that is something that the negotiators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| could take into account, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| What I was getting at is the body itself cannot say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| well, we moved to strike provision A from the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Right, that I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| As long as there's still, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| I wasn't aware there was still negotiation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| If there is, then certainly they can take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| what the commission believes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| And I guess my next question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| is the review committee and the proposed service provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| willing to consider some of those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| and suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Please introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| The negotiating parties at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| are myself, the mayor's office, and AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| So are you willing to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| some of those suggestions and recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| I suppose it would depend upon what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| and how it would change potentially the RFP itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| For instance, I know one of the suggestions that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| was the first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| other first responder organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| also have the ability to fill out a feedback form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| that is inside the contract itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Yes, I did see that amendment, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Yes, so some are very easy and very amendable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| but it depends upon what the others are specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| AMR, I know you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| if one of your representatives would come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Mr. Spencer maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I know you had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| one of my concerns was that my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| is completely in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| and so I wanted to know what was being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| what steps are being taken to bring KFD on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| because they are a first responder within city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| And I know you all had a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| so I'd just like to hear the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Josh Spencer, AMR, Gallows Point Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Yes, so we actually reached out to KFD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| and we have invitations out to some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| first responding agencies as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| to discuss how we can better come together and collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| We did meet with KFD for, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| nearly three hours earlier, late last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| We have a follow-up meeting established already for late November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| As a reminder, the entire kind of focal point of our proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| as we believe, is everyone coming together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| and working together better to solve a solution that's countywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and not just specific to any particular area or any vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| So that was the largest part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| It was a lot of collaboration, sharing ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| things that worked in the past that may work now, may not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| And I thought it was very well received by both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you. That's all I needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Earlier I saw Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Is he still in the building? Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2966)|
| 0:49:39| The usual name and address for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Brad Anders, Knox County 9-1-1, 605 Bernard Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| It's good to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| I'm having flashbacks. Can we get this over with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| I think you were in the audience during our workshop meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and Director Pardon of the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| testified to us that this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| 30% of the calls for service were incorrectly classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3000)|
| 0:50:07| Do you kind of remember that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| I remember the discussion. I remember the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| And so the process currently in the E911 Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| is the calls come in to your employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and then your employees transfer them to who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| To AMR rural metro dispatchers or call processors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| So in other words, the AMR employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| which were causing some of the ambulance confusion times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| were actually misclassified by their own employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| So under the new contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| where it's going to switch over to your employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| what percentage of calls do you expect to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| incorrectly classified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| Well, we hope for zero incorrectly classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| Our goal is to have zero errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| I mean, obviously, we're humans and that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| But some of that is not related just to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Some of that's related to the previous contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| and it's more or less a you-call-we-haul contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| And so not to say that anything was perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| I think blaming the people wholly is not satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| The people that work in there are high-quality people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| that care about the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| It's just it was a bad contract for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| and it was a bad contract for the provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| And so as we transition over for us doing that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| our goal is to have zero misclassifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| But, of course, we're all human and we're going to make mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Mr. Fardon, I've got just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3099)|
| 0:51:45| During our workshop, we had talked about the 2013 contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| and specifically on page 16 when it says that the old arrival time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| the component is they're supposed to be there in 17 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| for the outlying area, like in my district or Carson's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| or Commissioner Beeler's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| And then under the new contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| the time now has been shifted upward to 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Correct? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| So I'm looking back at the FITS report that this body spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| I guess it was over $100,000 to have this made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| and it says on the bottom of page 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| the contractor did not meet the 90th percentile requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| for the years 2021 and 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| even with the seven-minute allowance time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| So was the thought process when you did the RFP was to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| from 17 minutes to 20 minutes for the outlying county portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| of Knox County so that the ambulance provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| could hit the 90th percentile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| So how did the numbers change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Because is not the industry standard 10 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| for an ambulance call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| But now we're doubling that to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| It was 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| Now we're shifting to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| So it's not we're not getting service to our outlying areas like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| South Knoxville and East Knoxville, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| even we're not even duplicating the old time of 17 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| You served on the evaluation committee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| And part four of the evaluation committee for the RFP on page 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| there was a score of 300 points for the cost to the county portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3231)|
| 0:53:58| Do you remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Well, when I looked through at the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| I noticed that all five members of the committee all gave 300 points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| to AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Could you explain to me why you voted for the 300 points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| Is it just you personally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| What was your take on that as opposed to selecting the other ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| which were at a little bit higher number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Actually, the only individual on the committee that covers cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| is the procurement division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| The evaluators do not have that luxury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Well, he's standing behind you, so I guess that would be Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| Matt Myers, Director of Procurement, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| The cost portion of any bid or RFP is an objective number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| and that is computed by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| It looked like it was 300 points from each of the members of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| and that was not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| It was just one person assigning 300 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| They don't figure price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| So how did they get the 300 points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| The points were computed by procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| I know, but how did you get to that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Was it because they were the lowest bidder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| The lowest subsidy got the 300 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| The next lowest, it's a mathematical formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| You divide that into the low one, and then you get your percentage from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| and it tears down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| In this case, you're going higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| It's a mathematical formula we use for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| In a point system, though, it would be beneficial to lowball a financial amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| in hopes to get the maximum number of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| You're taking a risk at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| It could happen, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| In this case, the subsidy is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| Mr. Pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Back again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| This body in your office and the mayor's office started this notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| of a new ambulance contract about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| That's when we started on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| In the past year, AMR, knowing that they are potentially up for a new contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3384)|
| 0:56:35| and maybe not getting it, did their calls of service times decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3395)|
| 0:56:45| Did they have this big push to show Knox County that they've met all the benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| where they would not receive any financial penalties for missing those benchmarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| It was peaks and valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| It wasn't an all hands on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| We're going to do whatever we need to do to show the Knox County community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| that we're the guys that need to be here for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| I would probably ask Mr. Spencer that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| but I don't believe that anybody that's working for AMR currently would not want to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3438)|
| 0:57:30| Well, I'll defer because I see there's another light on for Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| If I could circle back around just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Mr. Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| In your opinion, what is the number one problem that we are occurring now from the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Is it the hospitals and a lack of staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| It's not the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I think it's the lack of staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| It's a blend of both, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Obviously, we know that there's hospital turnaround issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Talking with Mr. Spencer not long ago, those are becoming better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| but staffing is definitely an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| Being in the last year of your contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| I'm sure if you're going to still be the employer of choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| it would make that difficult to retain staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Nonetheless, try to recruit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| As several people stated, and Mr. Britt, a few moments ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| we may be in a situation where we'll probably have to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| I mean, you still can vote no or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| but I trust the committee and everybody involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| procurement, health department, the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| I trust everybody there, and it was on a points rating scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| That being said, I'm not going to look at the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I'm going to look at the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| That being said, since it has been announced that AMR was awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| prior to commission's vote, the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| what has changed as far as your staffing, your employee morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Because, like I said, I'm looking to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I'm not going to look at the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| The past is past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| We've just got to figure out what we can do come February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Actually, not February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Actually, for AMR, it's November the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| As Mr. Parton mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| one of the challenges that we face during this process is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| uncertainty and the anxiety of some of our workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| of will they have a job on February the 1st of 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| I will say we certainly did see some attrition issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| throughout the last six or eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| I'll also say that the day after we were notified with the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| to award, we started to see an influx of applications start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| flowing back in because there seemed to be some security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and that's what, obviously, the workforce wants and needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| I will say over the last two or three weeks, we've hired 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| I think, full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| That's a pretty good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| A lot of the things we're doing, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| we're changing some of our work schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| That makes for a better work-life balance for our workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| and provides more time off away from work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| which is obviously important and needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So I think those two things combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| the intent to award as well as some of the changes that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| made to our deployment and shift types has certainly drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| interest back to the candidate pool and get the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| flowing back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I requested from October 1st till whenever I requested it last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| week the number of ambulances that you had on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| and I want that basically, if you would, update that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| Get that and update it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| How many ambulances do you currently have available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| I mean, not on the road today, but available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| How many vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I think we have 46 ambulances currently in Knox County with AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| And if you had 46 paramedics, they all would be on the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Well, not all on the road, but there would be more than 16 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| Yeah, our goal is as many as we can possibly get on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| We'd love to have staffed and on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| I think yesterday, I think we had somewhere north of 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| 23 or so ambulances staffed yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| If I remember correctly, we're low 20s again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| And again, referring back to kind of the Fitch report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| which has become sort of the litmus test of what we believe we'll need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| I believe the staffing requirement in that report to meet the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| response times in the new contract is around 20 at peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| And so we're kind of hovering around that mark right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| We don't know how the system is going to behave, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| with these new response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| This is new for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| But I think we are in a good position and prepared to upstaff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| and continue the staffing improvements that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| in the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Is there more of an issue of staffing during the week or on the weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| or is it basically the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| I think it does present a few more challenges during the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| That's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| We do have some pretty aggressive shift differentials that we offer to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| workforce for nights and weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Here in the last couple weekends, we've seen a pretty nice improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| over what we've seen in some previous weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| So, again, we're definitely marching the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Do we have work to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Are we making some of the necessary changes to get better results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Mr. Britt made the comment, which is great comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| I'm not picking on Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| They were good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| What about a paramedic that's coming in to be trained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| What will they start out and the potential that they could make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| It's scalable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I'm kind of going from memory right here and guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| I think our current starting rate for paramedics is around probably $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| a year starting salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| Obviously, that's before nights and weekends and all the shift differentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| and overtime and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| It's important to remember we are a union shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| So we do have to kind of play within our different rules when we come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| giving pay raises to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| But I will say that as part of the subsidy, which is in our proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| a large portion of that subsidy is going back to our workforce to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| wages and hopefully improve recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| I've been in one of my many discussions with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| I've had several discussions with you guys and also, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| a couple of discussions with priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| If I'm not mistaken, you say that you're going to change your shift from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| 2448 to a 2472, which will give the paramedics more time off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3866)|
| 1:04:34| which is, if I figure that right, about seven or eight days a month that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| they're working and they're off to all that other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| I know it's a 24-hour shift, and I've never worked a 24-hour shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| I don't think I've ever stayed up 24 hours in my lifetime as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| But do you think going to a 48 to a 72 will increase your paramedics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3891)|
| 1:05:03| I think we've already started to see some of that because of just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| announcement a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Now, we have to go through a full shift bid kind of process as per our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| But, yeah, that is a very desirable shift type in the EMS industry right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| And that's not the only shift type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| There are certainly other that we offer 12-hour shifts consistent with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| same schedule the hospital or maybe the sheriff's department works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| But, yeah, that's a very desirable shift type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| We've deployed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| And I oversee about eight different markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| I think five of my eight have that shift schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| That's very popular, and folks really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And most of those operations are very well, if not fully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| staffed because of the shift type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| One to follow up on Commissioner Schoonmaker's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3947)|

| 1:05:58| Corrington, what's past Corrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Way out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| I mean, way, way, way out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I thought I was there, but I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I had to keep on driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Is it hopefully in the future that it's possible that there's an ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| stationed there at rural metro or at some volunteer fire at Johnson University?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| Hopefully they can stage it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| I know Chapman Highways is, without a doubt, I'm sure Chapman Highways is our major call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| down that corridor there because about everybody lives right around that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| I mean, it only makes common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| But hopefully in the future, when you get your staff together and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| that we can stage these far-reaching areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| And it won't be a 20-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| It will only be a four- or five-minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| And you can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| You understand what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| And that's part of really a dynamic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| And if you kind of think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| the idea is to have as many stations around kind of the perimeter as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| with more of the 12-hour kind of busy trucks or 10-hour trucks running in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| That's essentially a building for them to stay in when they're not busy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| When the system is moving and there's 20 trucks in the system and 18 of them are on a call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| you have to pull those resources in so you can better meet response times across the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| But, yeah, I mean, in a perfect scenario, in a good scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| that's certainly where one of our aim is to be stationed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| because it just makes sense just from a geography perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Yeah, that would be an agreement between the ambulance provider and the fire and rescue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| whoever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| And I think if that was possible, you know, I had mentioned this to Mr. Vanderveet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| but I think that we should be able to help there that if we needed a room or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| an addition or something, that we might be able to look at that ARPA funding, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| Like I say, I'm looking to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| I know the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| Man, if I knew the past, I'd be a multi-billionaire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| I wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| So, Josh, I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| If you get awarded, AMR gets awarded this contract, I'm looking for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| I'm not going to look at the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| It's no use crying over the spilled milk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| We just got to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Mr. Myers, where did he go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| All the way back to these back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| I'm doing well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| I won't be here sitting in this seat only about, what do we got, nine months away now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4121)|
| 1:08:47| Nine and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Nine and a half months away, I won't be sitting in this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| So, my question to you, there's measurements that AMR has to meet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| And is there a clause in there that if they're not performing, do we have an out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| So, we do have an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| We always have an out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| So, the commissioners that are not up for election or that are up for election and get reelected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| they're the ones that are going to have to kind of hold the feet to the fire to AMR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| and to make sure, and Kevin, hold his feet to the fire that all these processes are being upheld or adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4160)|
| 1:09:33| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| It's up to the health department and Mr. Hamby back there for them to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| It's up to all of us, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| It's not just to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| It's a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| I know Commissioner Frazier, she's very, very involved in fire and rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Thank goodness for her husband, Russ, who's a hero as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| The meetings that you have in the future, I really would like to see a commissioner there that does all this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4198)|
| 1:10:08| I don't know if that would be a courtesy, I guess, Mr. Director, as far as a courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| or if we have to do a resolution to add a commissioner to that review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4214)|
| 1:10:22| Obviously, we're happy to come and update you all whenever you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| There was some discussion that we would hold more of that inside of fire technical rescue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| Steve Hamby could report out on a regular basis at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| Obviously, I'm always here, so I'm happy to update accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| That's just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| You did make a great point about what it could look like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| I did want to stress that this is just the beginning, so perhaps something that you really wanted didn't make it in this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| I'm standing here very well aware of what happens when you let a contract sit still for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| I anticipate coming back, amending for better reasons, better response times, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| as opposed to just putting Band-Aids on something that we know is broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4272)|
| 1:11:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Thank you again, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| This, I guess, would be for Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| We're fairly familiar that AMR has been closing down ambulance services in other parts of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4294)|
| 1:11:45| including Nashville, upstate New York, and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| Since January 1st, there's been quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| How many new operations has AMR gone into in counties that had a previous ambulance service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4312)|
| 1:12:03| You're putting me on the spot on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| I just don't know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Brett, would you happen to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| My boss may have a better answer for that than I would because his territory is a little further reaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4328)|
| 1:12:14| Thanks, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Hey, Brett Jovanovich, Gallows Point Drive, AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| For those of you that don't know me, to Josh's point, I'm Josh's boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| I'm the regional VP for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| But, Commissioner Schoonmaker, to your point, we've seen a number of communities across the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| which is the area I'm responsible for, which is Louisiana, up through Arkansas, up through Kentucky and West Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| and everything to the east coast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| We've seen a number of communities moving both from governmental EMS, shifting to private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| and we've seen some communities moving from private to another private provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| There's a number of communities that we've bid on in Georgia, specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| We've seen success in rural Mississippi in growth and expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| I think part of the struggles that we've had, including the Knox County contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| which ultimately drove the subsidy ask under the new model, is really because the legacy fee-for-service system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| that was traditionally how EMS was funded back in 2013, we'll call it pre-COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| was that fee-for-services that were generated from ambulance transports paid for the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4399)|
| 1:13:27| What we've seen is, due to economic and inflationary pressures, the costs have far exceeded that fee-for-service model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| So we've really worked to right-size these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| In some contracts, we find ourselves in a scenario where we have to walk away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| because they're no longer financially feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I think from a Knoxville perspective, we certainly bid what we felt was appropriate and sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| for the long term in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| We're obviously excited we won the procurement, but we could have been on the other end of that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4432)|
| 1:13:58| So it's important to reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| So are you saying that in the Mississippi market you added one new contract this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| It's multiple. I can certainly follow up and give you a list, but there's multiple contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| More than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Mr. Spencer, since you've been the face of AMR for the workshop and for this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4453)|
| 1:14:23| are you confident that your people are telling you exactly what's going on in this market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| My people, as in our workforce, our local EMTs and paramedics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Yes, your management staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Well, because of the public now understanding there was a rebidding process for ambulance service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4476)|
| 1:14:47| and because of the coverage in the media, which has been great, a lot of people have been reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| to us individually and some in some high-profile positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| But do you have any idea how many ambulances were actually fully staffed on this past Saturday, Veterans Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| So two days ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| I just looked it up, but I think we peaked at 15 ambulances on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| We provide that report to Mr. Amby every day at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| Would it surprise you if the number was six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| That's not accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| And how many times on Saturday, because you were dropping patients off, were you at a level zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4524)|
| 1:15:32| I'm not sure of the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Would they be reporting that to Mr. Pardon if you were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| So we don't really know if that's fact or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| Because I guess the thing is, and this wasn't a UT home game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| When we have a UT home game, there's ambulances on every corner in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| I mean, you guys got that fully staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| There's, what, 45 ambulances within a six-block area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| But when I hear that there was only six on last Saturday, that's kind of surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| So if you don't mind checking with your staff to see if that is actually an accurate number that they were staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| I'll be happy to follow up on an accurate number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| Just for clarity, the most we deploy on the UT football games is six ambulances, sometimes seven depending on the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4577)|
| 1:16:24| And some of those ambulances come from other communities that come and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| So it doesn't deplete our resources on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Well, you know, we've heard since the beginning of this contract, one of the problems was that the hospitals weren't cooperating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4591)|
| 1:16:38| and there was extensive wall times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| And so apparently your PR representative reached out to the local hospitals this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| and we were just furnished a letter from Tenova Medical Center just before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4607)|
| 1:16:55| And it said they went back and did an analysis and their wall times at the Turkey Creek Medical Center was 23 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| and at the North Knoxville Center in Commissioner Lee's district was 36 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| So that's not these 50 minutes, hour, hour and a half waits that we're hearing as wall times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| And this is just one of the other three hospital operations in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| So I guess the public is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| You know, it's kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| They're saying, well, they're blaming the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Then they're blaming the EMTs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| Next they'll be blaming the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| So I guess our point is, you know, we haven't seen a dramatic increase since a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4652)|
| 1:17:42| that you guys are serious about wanting to maintain this contract because everybody sitting at this table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4662)|
| 1:17:51| we are tasked with protecting the health, the safety, and the welfare of all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| We take this very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| And so I did have just one final question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4682)|
| 1:18:22| Mr. Caldwell, how are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| I'm good, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| Financially, if a contract was not initiated by February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| does this legislative body have the powers to enact an emergency resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| to fund an alternate source for ambulance protection for the citizens of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4724)|
| 1:18:59| I'm looking at Mr. Moyers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I'm not sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Well, in other words, their contract ends February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| If this body votes not to go forward with their contract, theoretically that ends on February 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| they could just pack their bags and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| This body would have emergency powers to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| if we needed to select a second or an ambulance provider for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4766)|
| 1:19:34| What you're suggesting is going around the procurement process and just picking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| No, I'm just saying if we don't have, it's not gone through the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| because they can't do that between now and February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| I'm just asking that this body, I believe, would have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4788)|
| 1:19:56| I don't know that you would have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| What you're suggesting to me is that if a contract isn't signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| then the county commission could just pick whoever they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| They close operations on February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| We are sitting here with no ambulances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Well, one thing that could be done is to extend the contract month to month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| until a new bidding process was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| If that were the circumstance, it would be up to the mayor and the procurement office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4818)|
| 1:20:25| to find a solution, I suppose, whether it was a quick rebid or trying to get rural metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4825)|
| 1:20:34| I don't know how you could have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| I can't even imagine how that would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| It would be problematic to try to select a company out of thin air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| without some kind of procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| if there are multiple companies that are interested in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| That's just not how we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| Kind of going on that, we can't just blame one entity for the health care issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| The whole health care system is broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| I'm not here to play the blame game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I'm here, like Carson Daly is, to move forward, to look to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| I am here to give, at this point, AMR, a chance to prove that they can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| We do have a new contract that is better than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| It's not so antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| It has better response times, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| But with that, I do have a couple more questions for Mr. Spencer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker brought up something about this past weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| there only being six ambulances staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Do you have a certain number of ambulances that you staff 24 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| seven days a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Is there a minimum that you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| Yeah, I mean, it's fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| I mean, obviously we aim for the 20 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| That's kind of our benchmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And so there's days where it's 26, like a couple days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| There's days where it's 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| I think last Saturday was 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Certainly it's a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| As in any business, people call in for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| They have family emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| And so we're constantly working the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| Is there a minimum, though, that you won't go under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| We never want to go below 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| And that's really more in the 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| when there's not as many calls coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| And we typically stay around that number at night, late at night, early morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| And about 4, 30, or 5 a.m., it starts kind of ramping back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| as the call volume ramps up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| And is it just the response times that's better about the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| Or why are you all here, again, wanting to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| Like, what makes you, especially with this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| want to continue working for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| So I think, first of all, we've been in this community for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| and we certainly don't want to turn our back on this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| through a challenging health care time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| So that's answer number one of why we want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| There's about 200 employees that depend on us for their livelihood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| and their work to work for us, so that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| But some of the changes of the contract that I feel like are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| and sometimes perhaps even often overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| because we always kind of tend to tunnel vision on certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| but a great part of the contract really defines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| and focuses also as much on clinical outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| and clinical ability of our clinicians to perform in the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| as it does about how fast they drive to the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| There are certainly a number of calls, as has been very well mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| that 90% or so number are priority one calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| and only whatever 30 or so percent is actually true priority ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| What really is important is how are we treating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| are those patients being treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| is the end of their experience better for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And so that's one of the major focuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| And the other thing we keep saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| we fundamentally believe that having a unified medical director in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| is really going to do great things for this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| as it ties all of the first responders together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| under the same clinical ability and platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| and I think that's the most beneficial thing of the new agreement, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| And one for Mr. Parton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| I'm great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Glad when this is over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I appreciate all the time and work you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| One of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| or it was brought up that this would be a joint effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| in holding our ambulance provider accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| Is there a specific person, is that unified medical director the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| that will hold AMR accountable if there was a breach in contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| So the medical director will hold the clinical standards for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| In this contract, unlike the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| they do have clinical metrics that they have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| From a compliance time response, Mr. Steve Hamby, way over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| is the individual that has that task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Okay, because I know you said you would update us frequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| but ultimately this decision is resting with this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| and so I wanted to know who to talk to because we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| since this process has started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| been receiving emails from constituents about complaints for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| that, and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| So I would want to know me personally who I would send that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| In the next contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| you could actually send them to AMR as they'll have a complaint portal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| and that gets reported to us monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| But if anything is egregious or you just want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| you can reach out to me or Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| And Commissioner Schoomaker, at 3 o'clock on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| AMR had 15 ALS ambulances and 8 BLS ambulances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| according to the dispatch supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| And there's no zero time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| We don't track level zeros in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Mr. Spencer, I've got kind of a question, comment, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| Speaking to you numerous times, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| and like I said when we had the meeting here with commissioners on AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| there are a lot of good changes that I see forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| and I think that we can always look back and see of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| but I think it's important to step forward and move in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| So I had asked you, and you had agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| so I want to make sure that you're still on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| What I have asked Mr. Spencer to do is to be in front of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5216)|
| 1:27:03| quarterly to give us a report on what good things are happening at AMR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| what challenges you guys are still having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| because I think as commissioners, knowledge is power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| and we're able to share that knowledge with our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| And so that's something that I hope that we'll do at least the first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| and see how it's kind of going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| But I hope you're still agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| I have to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| I just saw this letter since Commissioner Schoonmaker brought this about to NOVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| and I'm appalled by this letter that we got from to NOVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| I was at to NOVA, nor three weeks ago, sat in the waiting room for five hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| and all I got was somebody to take my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| I couldn't even sit in a chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| and the people around me had been there seven, nine hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| For them to say that 26 minutes, 23 minutes is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| So it's appalling that they sent us this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| but hospitals do have to accept their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Just a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I wanted to first thank everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| I know it's a thankless job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| and I know that you all have spent a lot of time and attention and effort on this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| and I know that we have said we have felt very hurried,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| and to clarify that, hurried on our part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| I know that you've heard us, especially me, ask a gazillion questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| You've always answered my phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| You've always answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| You have listened to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| and I do tend to talk a lot and try to think outside of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| I, too, want to be solution-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| This is just an old saying, and I think I've said this to many of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| This is kind of like polishing a turd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| We have a lot of room for improvement, a lot of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| My perspective may be a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| because I not only have a responsibility and an obligation to the safety of my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5365)|
| 1:29:31| but I kind of do life with people like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| My inner circle and my world are people who run into chaos when everybody's running out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| and so I hear from them not just when a contract is up and it's up for negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5384)|
| 1:29:53| And so whomever, this is not a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| Next week is a voting meeting, so if you are awarded this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| you may regret it because I am going to be watching this like nobody's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| It's that important to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| and I have heard from people that I haven't heard from in 20 years about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| including my spouse, who has some pretty strong opinions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| To your point, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| I've had some really great discussions about how we do bring everyone to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| how we have these discussions more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| We have operated in silos when it comes to emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| Anyone who's been on that side of things will tell you for 10, 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| they've all predicted the model is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| The current model is not sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Well, we're here, and we all are tasked with the next step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| I think Brett said NOx 2.0, and he took my dot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| We've had a lot of dotted lines, and now we've got to connect them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| One thing I will be bringing to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| is revamping the Fire and Technical Rescue Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| and hopefully you will support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| that it will be more of an all-inclusive emergency services body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| that will meet regularly, will have these communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| will report back to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| because I think we all just feel like we were only included at the back end of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5490)|
| 1:31:39| which I totally understand, and that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| We're kind of in a new day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I'm so proud to be among my colleagues because I think in the past—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| I shouldn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| I think now we have a really community-minded commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| who are very hands-on, like super hands-on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| and we just want to be a part of making things better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| and there's a lot of room for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| Believe it or not, we have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| We were elected because we have some good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| and I hope that you will continue to listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| One of my suggestions did make it into the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| which was the peer agency surveys and reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| That's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| So saying that, just beware because I'm really going to be watching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5548)|
| 1:32:37| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| Before I ask my question, I did read the letter real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| By the time I go up to 75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I don't want to see Tenova with wait times of eight minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| 10 minutes, 12 minutes on that billboard, Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| Mr. Van de Beek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| you and I have had discussions, and I don't know if you can say yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| about the mission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| what you and maybe the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| some of the things that there's a high, high volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| of the mission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Some of the things that we might be able to do to help ease that burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| I appreciate the question, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| because it's really a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| As I mentioned during the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| when you think about particularly for those of you that have county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| balanced districts, Mr. Beeler, yourself, Mr. Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| Mr. Schoonmaker, Mr. Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| and even those of you that have hybrid districts like Commissioner Oster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| Commissioner Ward, there are few places where you have such a consolidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5629)|
| 1:33:58| of high demand for services that is both patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| and geographic centric the way the mission district is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| And so it does pull a lot of resources out of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| out of the EMS system as a whole, not just the ambulance side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| but the hospital side of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| It pulls a lot out of the system in order to serve those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| The other location, as I mentioned at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| are assisted living facilities and nursing homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| and that just is what it is, candidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| But the mission district is a place where we think we can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| Mr. Parton went out a couple of years ago and found Dr. Megan Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| and I can't continue to thank him enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| She's just an exceptional medical professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| and she's been doing a lot of research into how we can impact the mission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| by treating patients in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| There are things that can be done in the field that currently result in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| often in KFD being dispatched, which puts pressure on their system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and then subsequently in an ambulance being dispatched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| which puts pressure on their system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| and subsequently that patient being transported to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| which puts pressure on their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| If you can treat that patient in the field successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| and keep them from entering the system beyond that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| you can do so much good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| So things like wound treatment, certain illness calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| even certain medical conditions like blood pressure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| if those can be successfully treated in what the contract calls community paramedicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| what we informally call street medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| we can have downstream impacts that we really think are consequential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| So she's hard at work at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| Mr. Parton's hard at work at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| They've got a working group stood up, which does ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| I can't remember, maybe, Commissioner Durich, you had asked about KFD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| Chief Compton is a part of that working group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| We have them extensively engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| and we think this is a place where we can take pressure off the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Will it fix everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| No, but we take our opportunities where we can find them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| and this is one where we think it's just right there in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| So I hope that answers the question, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you for your patience, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| This is just kind of a clarification statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| When I mentioned the letter that commissioners receive from Tenova Healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| and I referenced Tenova North and Commissioner Lee's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| and I mentioned the 36 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| those 36 minutes is when the ambulance backs up to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| and they offload the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| and then that patient is accepted into the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| So I'm a little confused because, Commissioner Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| you didn't spend five hours in an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| You spent time in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| Now, their letter is just addressing the wall time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| because we've heard this extensive amount of times that AMR is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| that they're there for an hour before whoever unloads them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| and this obviously dispels that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| So I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| This is just strictly once the ambulance backs up to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| and offloads that patient and they accept them at Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| not going to the emergency room and waiting in the waiting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| Commissioner Lee, your response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| I would like to say that the person sitting next to me came in by ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| had an IV, and had been sitting on the wall for seven hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| and had not seen a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| But they're not sitting in the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| They've already been unloaded onto the hospital property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| The point is they're meeting, turning around those ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| to help the rest of your community by getting those ambulances back into service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5876)|
| 1:38:01| So the point is they were not sitting in that ambulance for over five hours, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| Not in the ambulance, in the hospital, in a waiting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| Right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Madam Chair, could I just call Commission's attention to something I think is relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| and might help that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| I would, as I always should, discourage over-reliance on individual anecdotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| or stories or experiences and come back to the Fitch Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| because it's the objective analytics or the objective analysis of data that we really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| And I just wanted to remind Commission, page four, early in the report, item three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| that Fitch's analysis, no one else's, but Fitch's analysis of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| independent consultants from outside the market who are under no obligation to anybody but the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| found that wall times were the equivalent of almost seven ambulances added back into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| So that encompasses the Tenova hospitals, that encompasses the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| that encompasses the Covenant hospitals, and that encompasses Park West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| So if at any point in time you could add seven ambulances back into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| the effects of that would be immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| So I haven't seen the letter and I certainly wouldn't take issue with Tenova's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| All I can tell you is that system-wide, Fitch clearly identified wall times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| as a significant obstacle to any vendor's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| And, again, that's item three in the summary in the Fitch Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5967)|
| 1:39:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| This has been a great discussion tonight and I'm certain it probably will be continued again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5975)|
| 1:39:43| I just have one question, if someone can answer this in less than a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| We have been reminded of the rumor that AMR might be going broke because of their parent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=5990)|
| 1:40:04| Who would care to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6004)|
| 1:40:14| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| I don't know if I can address it in 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| Try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Look, I think, and as I said earlier, I think several of you had the opportunity to talk directly to our CFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| We did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| I know our CEO, COO, and CFO also compiled a letter that I think was emailed to Commissioner earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6030)|
| 1:40:39| which should provide some additional comfort and guidance around how our debt structure works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| and how solvent we are as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| I would certainly point Commission back to that letter specifically signed by our CEO, COO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| and CFO as additional reassurances of our solvency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| And I bring that up because many who are listening and are involved in this have not had a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| an opportunity to see that letter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| So I just wanted that on the record that that had, in fact, happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| We have a proper motion and a second on the floor to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Item number 43 is Resolution 901, urging the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and the TDOT Excess Land Office to streamline and accelerate the excess land sale process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6096)|
| 1:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6105)|

| 1:41:51| Second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| If you all have no objection, I'd like to be added as a sponsor to that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| We have a proper motion and second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Do the sponsors of the resolution, is there an issue or a problem that we're trying to fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| And if so, could you enlighten us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Yes, is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| So this, the Right-of-Way Division Excess Land Office, they're responsible for the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| and disposal of TDOT surplus property or land that's no longer needed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| The current process takes up to nine months or even longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| We've seen it last over a year to get through the Excess Land Office and Excess Land Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6166)|
| 1:42:54| For small business owners, this equates to possible lost income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| And so we would like for them to streamline and accelerate that process and increase their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| standards to less than nine months instead of nine months or more, but less than nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| And by chance, did either of the sponsors reach out to Senator Massey, who's the chair of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6192)|
| 1:43:19| Transportation Committee, to get her input to see if there was something they could do on her side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| of the aisle to be able to streamline that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| Actually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| I reached out to Senator Massey, particularly about one of my small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I have three right now in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| The process is stated that it's supposed to be a nine-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| Two of my small businesses have stopped pursuing it after two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| They can't even get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| With the help, of course, of Jim Snowden, we were able to get two of our businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| to the right person at TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| And so this resolution really is to just hopefully get this process back to a nine-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6243)|
| 1:44:12| I mean, I think that we can probably all agree that our small businesses are pretty important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| And if we can help them speed up processes that really shouldn't be a government red tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| of two years or more to be able to expand their parking at their parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| that to me just seems like some red tape that we can probably lower down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| and get some help for our, particularly our small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6284)|

| 1:45:07| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6316)|

| 1:45:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| If I may, if the body agrees, I'd like to address number 46 and number 47 at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6325)|
| 1:45:32| This just came up at our recent Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| and this is really administrative housekeeping action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| just to ensure that both Commission and members of county boards and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| adhere to the Knox County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6343)|

| 1:45:51| we found that there are sometimes just an implied or assumed reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| but there's nothing written into rules or bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| So that's what these two resolutions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| One, they write it into Commission's rules and bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| and then two, the rule, it just furthers the work as we review the county boards and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| to ensure that each of those bylaws and rules are updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| and also reference the Knox County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6380)|

| 1:47:41| this is a resolution as a result of an inquiry regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| commissions, the body's ability to refer an agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6464)|

| 1:47:51| to one of the many county boards and committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Currently, as it's written, only the chair can do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| and we are respectfully asking that we add a majority vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6478)|

| 1:48:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| Motion by Hill, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| This calendar change actually comes at our own convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| In February, we are struggling with our day on the Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| and conflict also with National Association of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| I have requested and we have found out through our commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6549)|
| 1:49:15| that the date of February 21st, which is a Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6555)|
| 1:49:24| proposing moving our regular Monday meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| which was going to have to be Tuesday anyway because it's a holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6570)|
| 1:49:38| to that Wednesday, February 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| and then the following Tuesday, February 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| moving the commission and zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| Is there any discussion or objections to those meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| And the main assembly room is available on both those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| Yeah, I would have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| You said move the commission meeting to the 21st on a Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| I would have a conflict with that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| The 20th is the closing and second day of our day on the Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6618)|
| 1:50:30| and Commissioner Schoonmaker and several of our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| stay that day and go over to the House and Senate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| to sit in on committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| So I think that would eliminate several of us on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6645)|
| 1:50:53| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Just a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| are we saying the work session would be on February 21st, Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| And then the regular meeting on the 28th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| No, on the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| On Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Let me just clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| The 20th, Drew is saying that on the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| there are no meeting rooms available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| So that's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| She said the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| So in addition to several of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| still being in Nashville, there are no rooms available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| So we have to do the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Same time, same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| Can you repeat the actual commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Is it Monday the 26th or Tuesday the 27th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| My date written down is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| ...is the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| So the proposal on the floor is Wednesday, February 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6732)|
| 1:52:22| for our workshop, finance, and beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6742)|
| 1:52:30| And Monday the 26th, February 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| for our zoning and commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Seeing no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6764)|

| 1:52:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| Let the record reflect one nay vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6772)|
| 1:52:57| This moves on to next week for final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6777)|
| 1:53:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| We're looking at zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Before we get into zoning, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| I believe that Commissioner Durrett had asked for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| I wanted to do this before the mayor left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| As you know, it is November, which is Diabetes Awareness Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| and we did do our annual physical challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| I see him trying to sneak away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| Uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6814)|
| 1:53:36| We went to Top Golf and got to play at St. Andrews in Scotland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| Did you know you could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| I sure didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| And, you know, it was touch and go for me there for a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6825)|
| 1:53:51| but it did come down to the last hole, and I was victorious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| So I had to say that, but I also wanted to say it looked a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| presumptuous of who was going to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| But for the mayor being such an awesome sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| I think he gets the t-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| Mr. Mayor, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| Actually, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| No, I just appreciate Commissioner Durrett always doing this every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| I let her win, by the way, because it is her idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Now, she beat me fair and square, but I do appreciate her doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6873)|
| 1:54:39| And, you know, Commissioner Frazier was talking about this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| being very involved with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| So it's fun, but it also raises awareness for a very important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| So I so appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| This was her idea, and I so appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| And we have a tradition now, and apparently the tradition is I lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| But thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Thank you both for being such good sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| So what's next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| We're figuring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| What did we talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Hockey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| Yeah, we can maybe do hockey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| I can't skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Well, Commissioner Frazier, that will be part of the suspense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| We'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| We'll let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| Thank you, everyone, for being such good sports about all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| certainly for a very worthy cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| And if you wouldn't mind wearing a little splash of blue on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| that is the color for diabetes awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| If you would give that to me in an e-mail, I might remember to pass it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6944)|

| 1:55:51| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6952)|
| 1:56:01| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6961)|

| 1:56:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Mine is actually deferred until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| I already spoke to the builder and developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| and I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| I'm happy with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=6998)|

| 1:56:42| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| No comments at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| I have no issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7007)|

| 1:56:52| 59 is a small parcel near Harbison's Crossroads that is surrounded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| In fact, if I had not seen the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| I would have told someone it was commercially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7023)|

| 1:57:31| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| 64 or 65?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| Kind of caught me off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| Is that the Brown Road Loop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| It's actually an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| Brown Mountain Loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| There's a situation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| I'll be making a motion that's kind of unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| So stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| We'll see you next Monday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7080)|

| 1:58:05| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| I would just like to know if Ms. Evans and Ms. Ellis might search the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7089)|

| 1:58:22| Director Moyers is pretty sure yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| Am I going to become a meme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| I deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| I would applaud that searching of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| Just one more thing I wanted to tell you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| We think we might know what true terror is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| True terror, though, is really to wake up in the morning and discover that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7124)|
| 1:58:49| a high school graduation class is running the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7129)|
| 1:59:01| Commissioner Daly, can you top that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| On behalf of Buzz and Wreaths Across America, they're still taking donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| I think we're a little short on wreaths, my last count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| December the 16th, we're laying the wreaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| Shout out to my commissioner right over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231113?start=7161)|
