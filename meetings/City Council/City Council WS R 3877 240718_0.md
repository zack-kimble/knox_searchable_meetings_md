| 0:01:32| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| Welcome everyone who is attending in person, but also watching from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| We are here today at the request of council to review voting options for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=99)|
| 0:01:47| elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| We have had longstanding processes for voting in the city, and due to a recent state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=109)|
| 0:01:57| change, we have a small window, a brief window, excuse me, to consider any alternatives, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| so we will review both the existing approach to voting, we will look at the state law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| was recently passed, we will discuss a process for any changes, and what impact that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| have to city of Knoxville elections, and we will hear about any proposals from council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| members and have a general discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| This is a non-voting meeting, but we will discuss these items at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| We have collected questions from council members and shared those with some of the presenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| We've also asked for input from MTAS, a representative from MTAS was not available to join us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| but I am assured that they will be available on Tuesday as we hear some of the proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| as part of our normally scheduled council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| However, MTAS has contributed a lot of research and input and provided those to members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| the presenters today, particularly Mr. Frost, so MTAS will be present with us even if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| One more item for council members, I would suggest that council members ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| in the sequence of the agenda, this is a pretty dense agenda, so don't save them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| for the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Some of the topics are unique and different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| Feel free to weigh in with questions and we will have discussion at the end as well for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| any questions that were not answered as part of the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| To start, I have asked Mr. Frost to join us in a little bit of a different seat tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=213)|
| 0:03:41| to review our existing manner of holding elections related to our existing city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=221)|
| 0:03:49| So Mr. Frost, I'm not sure if there were specific questions presented by council to you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| this section, but if you would please give us an overview of our existing elections and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| how they function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you, Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| Let's talk about the district specific seats first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| We presently have six districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Districts one through four and district six are elected at one time, and then two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| later district five, currently represented by Council Member Thomas, and the three at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| seats are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| So for the district races, right now what's on the books, but I'll get to why that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| now not allowed, everybody runs within the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| They want to represent for the primary election and then for the general, also known as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| regular election, those six district seats run on a citywide basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| For the three at-large seats, for the district seats, you must live in the district you wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| The at-large seats, the residency requirement is you're a resident of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| it can be anywhere in the city of Knoxville for one year minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| And the people who run for at-large seats A, B, and C, they run on a citywide basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| in the primary, and they run on a citywide basis in the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| What the state law has done, and it's contrary to the city charter, however, if people remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| their civics classes and the pecking order, the state comes above the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| So we don't even need to change our charter to go with what the state has changed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| law to mandate, and that is for the city district races, you only have a district primary, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| then the top two vote-getters have a runoff, but only members, excuse me, only voters in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| that particular district get to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| That's what the state has mandated us to do, the city of Knoxville, we don't even need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| to change our charter, because we'll do what the state law says, we'll comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| So that, you know, a little bit brings us to the discussion here tonight about items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| further on down the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Before we move a little bit more detail into the most recent state law that was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| are there any questions for Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| How long have we voted this way as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| The way you just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| Like since the 50s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| I mean, I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| As 1969 was the first election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| And prior to that, if memory serves, everybody ran city-wide prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=413)|
| 0:07:02| There were no districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| All seats were at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| And in 1969, we created districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| It was 68, technically, but the first election was 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Well, just to piggyback off of that question, I'll ask that in a sec, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=445)|
| 0:07:41| I want to back up a little bit, just to get it on the record, because this workshop was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=461)|
| 0:07:53| introduced as a workshop called a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| But I would object to that, because we have a process in place to set workshops, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| asked for a charter review process workshop, which would include this section of our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| for the last two years, and haven't been able to get a workshop, and that is a process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| the full city council votes on, so I'm not holding either of our vice mayors accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| but we as a body should be held accountable to when we are scheduling this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| And we've had an opportunity over the last two years, but have not taken it, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| had an opportunity over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Since the state law has passed, we've had an opportunity over the last six months, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| the law department has announced that they're not pursuing a legal case, and I'm just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| little frustrated that we've chosen at this late hour to hold the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| So I just wanted to clarify that I don't feel like this is a workshop that the council has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| requested unless the brief conversation at the last council meeting represents a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=539)|
| 0:09:08| for us to override our other processes for scheduling workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| I also don't know what the count was that day on how many people said we needed a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| on this topic, so I just take issue with that description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| I feel like we should have done a workshop much earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| The next thing I wanted to comment on was what Mr. Frost commented on, which was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| whether we do a charter amendment this year or not, we will have to change our elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=579)|
| 0:09:49| We will not be able to move forward with our same system that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| And when I spoke with the law department earlier this year about bringing an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| to change our charter, I was told that an ordinance was not needed because the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=600)|
| 0:10:13| law would take effect and we would not have to rush the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| And so I did not want to rush the process after having that conversation, but I regret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| that we are just now beginning the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| And so I would want us to keep in mind what we were just shared, which is that not including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| the fifth district issue, but just pertaining to what we are having to respond to in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=637)|

| 0:10:55| us to get a new election process in place for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| Have I said that in a way that is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| I think that is a fair representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| The city and the election commission will abide by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Director Swanson, I wanted you to address the rushed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Did you have occasion to review and suggest changes or edits to the fifth district amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| I did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Did you have occasion to review and suggest changes or edits to the regional at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| amendment proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Mr. Frost, did MTAS and yourself have conversations regarding the fifth district amendment proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=700)|
| 0:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Did they have a chance to review that proposal and suggest edits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| I believe they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And did you have occasion as well as MTAS to have discussions about the at large amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| I wish I had more time, but I was able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| And did they make suggestions and edits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| And did those edits and suggestions find themselves in what is in front of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| I think they did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| So, I would disagree with the characterization that this is a rushed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=738)|
| 0:12:28| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| I would like to respond because when I brought charter amendments before this body two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| ago in June of 2022, I was told at that time that there wasn't enough time for us to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=757)|
| 0:12:46| those issues as a body and for us to bring those to the public for a discussion before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| they would go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| So, I'm following what my colleagues have expressed in the past in terms of a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=774)|
| 0:13:04| And if introducing charter amendments in June of a year is too short of a process, I imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| that introducing it at the end of July is also a rushed process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| And those items may have been introduced to MTAS and the law department, but especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| the regional representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| This is the first any of us have had to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| This is the first that the public is hearing about this idea of regional representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| And I believe council and the public needs more time when major amendments like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| are brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Any other questions on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Wilma Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| I don't know if this is the law director or Mr. Frost, but I know that when the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=840)|
| 0:14:11| law changed, the city of Knoxville was impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| And are there other municipalities that vote somewhat like we did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=856)|
| 0:14:25| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| I believe that there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| I believe that there were, yeah, I think there was a handful of other municipalities who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| were similarly impacted because it was a statute of general application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And is the proposal that MTAS has reviewed, is this the way other municipalities vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=883)|
| 0:14:56| so that they are not impacted by the state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| So, this way of voting, while it is different, is used elsewhere in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=903)|
| 0:15:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Councilwoman Helsley, just to keep us focused on the outline of the agenda, if there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| any questions or concerns around how we currently vote or the structure of our current processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| I was just going to piggyback on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| How many municipalities in Tennessee vote the way of our proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Councilmember Roberto might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Do it like what we are proposing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Maybe we will revisit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| And just for the record, we did vote on doing this at the last meeting and the vote was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| 8 to 1 in case anybody was not watching and wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Just a question, I suppose, for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| If we were to pass one of these charter recommendations, when would it be on the ballot for the voters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=958)|
| 0:16:06| November 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Is that right, Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| November 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| So, the public would have until November 5th to review our actions and then decide whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| or not that they wanted to accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| I mean, that is stating the obvious, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| So, I am addressing the issue about whether or not there has been enough discussion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| whether or not the public would have time to review our actions, but the final word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| would be in November for the public to give us an okay or a not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| So, there would be until November for the public to review whatever action that we took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| For those 16 other municipalities, I think it is important to understand more about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| before we compare them to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| What is the population size of these cities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Do they have a similar government structure than we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Are we talking about an alderman structure of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| Are we talking about a councilman structure of government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| These are important conversations to have as we are considering changing our election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| For me, I feel a bit taken back and a bit nervous with this process because I see before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1054)|
| 0:17:48| me an electoral system being presented that is a fully at-large system, essentially, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1068)|
| 0:17:59| a city where I'm the only person of any color to ever win an at-large seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1079)|
| 0:18:10| And when we see people of color come onto the city council, it is when we form districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1090)|
| 0:18:19| I can't even get past that part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| What is being proposed is going to a system that no other black person has been able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1104)|
| 0:18:34| get elected within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| People are telling me it has been 114 years we have been working for this or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| it has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Now we want to move our entire system to that and ignore the fact that we did not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| person of color on this council until we formed districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| I'm struggling with that, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Just to keep us going, Councilmember Roberto, any questions or discussion around our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| elections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Just for clarity, Mr. Frost, going back since we are talking about our existing manner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| holding elections, has every district representative since this change was enacted run in an at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Having been through the process, I can tell you that you run in a district primary and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| then you run at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| So all district representatives have run in an and-one at-large races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1167)|
| 0:19:35| Every single one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| So there are lots of examples of Knoxville having a diverse council that has run on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| at-large basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| Any other questions on this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| If not, we will pivot to the next part of the agenda, which is passage of the Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| Charter 391, Act of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| There are a number of items in this section, but I guess, Mr. Swanson, if you could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| us an overview of the state law that was passed last year and its impact on our elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| compared to what we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Frankly, I thought Mr. Frost did an admirable job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Essentially, the bottom line is what happened was the state legislature adopted a statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| that took away city council's option to do what they did, which was have district races| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| run in the primary, but then those who advanced from the primary races then went to an at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| vote for the regular election, for the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| And the state legislature said, we don't want that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| We want district-only races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| And so that's the Public Chapter 391 accomplished that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| It said, if you're going to have district council members, those district council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| must be elected both primary and in the general election in the district only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| So that's really the impact of Chapter 399.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Did the Public Chapter address being able to win at the primary level if someone got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| more than 50% since it would just be district and then district again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1286)|
| 0:21:34| No, it did not address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Technically, what it did was take away the exemption that allowed us an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| We had an exception and a few other municipalities had an exception that allowed us to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| the way that we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| And what they really did in the statute was remove that exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| I may just ask a question there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Because it was an exception that we operated under, because that exception has been removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| we are essentially left with options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| We aren't dictated specifically for one type of approach because there are multiple cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| in the state that have different approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Is that the right way to think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Well, the change in the state law took away our exception and it said going forward, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| going to do this new system, but you can also take into account other processes to do your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1340)|
| 0:22:30| elections and that's what we're discussing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| So as long as we're in compliance with the state law, there are options for us to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| The statute only addresses district only representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Just piggybacking on what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| So the election process that Knoxville has been used to for 55 years changed, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| through action of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| That changed because of the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And what we're discussing is what types of ways the people of Knoxville, the voters of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| Knoxville can make a choice on what they might want to do for, you know, what those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| elections might look like going forward, because what we're trying to do is get into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| with state law, which right now we're a violation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| Are you asking the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Maybe it's not a very artfully crafted one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I would assume that is your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| Are there any other questions about the state law that passed in 2023?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I assume not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| This council is very familiar because we had a workshop dedicated to that and had multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| rounds of public input at council meetings and all the community meetings that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| So we're very familiar with it, but I wanted to make sure that the public was aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| the ramifications of that state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| If not, we'll move on to the next stage of our agenda, which is the Home Rule Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Amendment Referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| And so if we were to propose changes to our voting, someone alluded to this earlier, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1463)|
| 0:24:31| we've asked Chris Davis, the Knox County Election Commission administrator, to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you, Mr. Davis, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Whatever, if we made any change to the way we vote and put it on the ballot, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| walk us through what the process would be, what the cost would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| What should we expect in terms of a timeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| Let the voters and, excuse me, the residents and potential voters on this matter understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| what's ahead if that were to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| I appreciate being invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| I will tell you that Tennessee Code Annotated Title II, Chapter 3, Part 204 talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| a general law which frequently controls the timing of an election, of a question or referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| and provides for the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| If a county resolution or municipal ordinance directs the county election commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| hold a referendum on the same day as the August general election, a regular November election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| such as one we have coming up, any regularly scheduled municipal election or presidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| preference primary, then the resolution or ordinance shall be filed with the county election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| commission not less than 75 days prior to such an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I'm going to assume that the reason that we're here today is to place a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I'm just going to cut to the chase that we're here to potentially place a question or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| on the November 5th, 2024 ballot, and if so, the question worded in proper form, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| believe the way the question should be outlined, I believe, at least is touched on briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| in Title II, Chapter 5, Part 208 of Tennessee Code, referring to how you would craft a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| in a yes-no fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| I'm sure you're familiar with that, having, I believe, the last time we had the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| put questions on the ballot, or the city put questions on the ballot was in November of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| 2016, I believe that was, that's eight years ago, so that would govern that, but nonetheless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| the question in proper form, and my assumption is it would have to be approved by two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| I guess, of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| I'm getting into y'all's business a little bit now, but it would have to be to our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| and completed no later than Thursday, August the 22nd, which is, yeah, it's about, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| five weeks from now, something like that, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| At that point, then also, if in reading Article 11, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| the legislative body of the municipality would have to publish the proposal so made and submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| the same to its qualified voters at least 60 days after the publication, so meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| basically you would have to, you being the city, would have to publish the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| It doesn't say in a newspaper general circulation, I'm going to let you, you know, craft your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| We're probably going to do it in a newspaper of general circulation anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| I assumed you would, but I'm not going to, shouldn't be assuming things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Nonetheless, it would have to be published no later than 60 days prior to the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| and of course, we would have to follow, we being the Election Commission, would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| to follow all applicable guidelines with regard to our normal notices, meaning that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| have to publish it sometime between 20 and 30 days prior to the election, which we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| do with our early voting ad, which would be published on or about, let's see here, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| or about October the 11th, and then we would also publish that again, not that we're required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| to do so under charter or anything, but just under general state law on October the 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1658)|

| 0:27:45| This question would be put to the voters both in early voting, nursing homes, absentee voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| as well as property qualified voting, which is something we don't normally have to worry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| about during a November presidential election, and so I can't even begin to tell you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| I've had a couple of sleepless nights over the whole prospect of putting questions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1683)|

| 0:28:12| but nonetheless, if that's what we're directed to do, we will proceed forth, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| a whole laundry list of challenges that I'd be glad to opine on, but I'm also glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1696)|

| 0:28:22| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Are there questions for Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1707)|
| 0:28:39| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Oh, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| Election Administrator Davis, I don't think I've been in a public meeting with you since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| my time on the Election Commission, but great to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| My question is, can you talk to us a little bit about, you know, the challenges or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| ease at which you can administer an at-large election versus a district race?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Are there challenges that you have to deal with with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Specifically, I'm thinking about the 5th District and the other at-large races going on at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| But if you could expand on that, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Yeah, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| I assume you're referring to the challenges maybe we faced last year, for instance, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| we had the 5th District and then we had, I guess, the three at-larges, as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| mayor and the municipal judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Certainly, it is a little bit of a logistical problem for us just because we have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| sure that the 5th District precincts, you know, get the specific ballot, but the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| precincts in the City 1, 2, 3, 4, excuse me, Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 get a separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| ballot from District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| So essentially, we're not letting any District 5 voters pollute that ballot or, more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| vice versa in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| So there's a little bit of, you know, some different ballots we have to print for different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| There are a couple of City Council precincts, excuse me, there are a couple of Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| Commission precincts that have voters both with the 5th District and with another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| I'm thinking specifically of Precinct 19 is Thrive Lonsdale, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| There's where you've got District 3 and District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Obviously, we don't want to let a District 3 voter vote in a District 5 race, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| I will tell you from a practical perspective, and I'm just going to editorialize here a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| little bit, the idea of moving the 5th District into the same cycle as the 1, 2, 3, 4, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| 6 is very appealing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| I will tell you, it is, I'm not going to get into the, I'm not going to editorialize much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| beyond that, but I think it would make it much easier to administer said election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Solomon Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| In terms of cost, when I brought an amendment forward a couple of years ago, I was told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1848)|
| 0:30:58| at the time that each question would cost us $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Is that an accurate estimate of what that cost should be this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| I will tell you, looking at a number of different costs, and I won't go into them in detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| unless you want me to go into them in as much detail as I can, it's hard to estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| but I would estimate on the low end, for the sake of argument, I don't know that the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| of questions necessarily matters so much as the length of how long the questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| I'm looking at what I assume are the individuals who might write the questions or at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| have some good input into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| But it's going to depend, it's going to lengthen the ballot, essentially, meaning we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| go from an 8.5 by 11 ballot to an 8.5 by 14 ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| That seems like a little thing, but when you're in the polling place and you're printing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| that ballot out, every little bit of time is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| If you're going from this upcoming ballot, as an example, and I don't want to get too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| far in the weeds and bore anybody, but to give you an example, this upcoming November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| ballot, at the moment, will have your race for president, it'll have your race for United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| States Senate, United States House, everybody will get a state house seat, and then about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| 40% of the county will get a state senate seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| So right now, the immediate moment, we're looking at four to five races on a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| What that means for us is, it's a very short ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| It's an 8.5 by 11 piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| We have been voting since August of 2020 on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| The last time we had the questions was in 2016, when we didn't have paper, we had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| old rotor, you know, machines, which made it much easier to administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| But nonetheless, it could take adding even one question, let alone potentially three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| or even four, because my understanding, we're not doing this in a vacuum, is that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| may be looking at adding a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| It could increase it from an 8.5 by 11 to 8.5 by 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| It could increase it potentially from one page to two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| And with the fact that I'm planning on well over 200,000 voters coming into our polling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| place, if I have to go from one page to two pages, primarily because of questions, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| going to be a significant cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| And I would say it could be, I'm low ending it here, could be 30,000, it could be upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| of 70 or 80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| And I've just been doing, I apologize, I've been doing some back of the math, back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| the napkin math this week because I'm conducting an election right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| But there are going to be, you know, not only the cost for ink and the cost for paper, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| potentially the cost for extra workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| And one of the reasons I say that is, and most of you probably know this, but many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| your voters do not, is there are a number of precincts that we call county precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| You can think of those as Powell Halls, Farragut, South Doyle, those types of places where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| are city voters that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| And so normally it'd be very simple to just take them a general election ballot for election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| day if you live in Farragut or if you live in South Knox County down in the new Hopewell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| area or if you live up in, you know, you live up in the Powell area or maybe in the Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| area or somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Well, now I'm going to have to, there's about 5,800 voters that are city voters that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| not in city precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| You may know well those as city annexed voters or I would call them finger annexed voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| For instance, some of the ones that jump out at me are over in North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| down in the southwest portion of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I'm not good with what, eight, nine miles from downtown, but yet they are in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| So we'd have to provide them with the city ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| What that does is when you go into the polling place on election day at say, let's say Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| say 69 North, which is a precinct out in southwest Knox County, normally on election day, while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| it'll be extremely busy, I'm giving them one ballot, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| Now with this contributing to it, I'd have to give them two ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| And so that's going to be increased costs that I normally wouldn't have to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Number two, something I didn't think about until yesterday, I'm glad somebody brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| that up for me, was property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| And we have literally, I don't know who's been talking to who here, but we've had probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| 15 to 20 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| We won't get 15 to 20 calls during a city election asking about property qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| We've had them now in the last week, people calling about property qualified and wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| to vote and getting registered as property qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| And I can't really imagine they're worried about, no offense to y'all, city council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| elections next August, I'm assuming that they're getting fired up because of something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| may or may not be on the ballot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| So there will be increased costs for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| And granted, that's only about 300 people, but we do have to take the time to process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| all of the applications for ballot, turn around and make sure they get the proper ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| and then make sure that it gets out to them because they're going to be able to vote in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| their county precincts for those that live in Knox County, but then they're also going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| to have to be mailed the questions if they live in basically city, excuse me, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| qualified voters, voters who live somewhere in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| They may be voting, they could be in Blount County and get their Blount County ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2136)|

| 0:35:45| Those really are the, you know, and then there's going to be additional staff costs because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| if I have to put what's, once again, I feel like I'm getting too far into the weeds here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| but please tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| This is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| I will tell you that we have two methods of administering elections on election day in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| our 78 polling places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| In some precincts, I'll use precinct 17, for instance, Christenbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Generally speaking, we are using pre-printed ballots on election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| You go in, you present yourself to vote, you get your ballot, you vote it, you go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| In some precincts, I could think of John, excuse me, Larry Cox is a good one, North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Larry Cox, anybody who votes at Larry Cox, there are two precincts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| I need to ensure that the voters get the proper ballot, so I have to have what's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| a ballot on demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Just literally, if you go right next door, you can see the ballot on demand where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| print your ballot off when you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| We have to have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Right now, at the immediate moment, I'm planning on deploying about 23 of those for election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| day based on just a variety of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| If we have to go to something where we put city questions on the ballot, that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| going to increase somewhere around 30 to 38, going from 23 to 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| That's an additional 15 locations that will have a ballot on demand, which means we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| a couple of additional workers to make sure that we're pushing the right buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| There's some increased cost there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Unfortunately, counselor, I'm not sure I can give you an exact amount, but I'm spitballing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| here and saying it's not going to be insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| It's going to be low end 30, maybe high end 70 to 75, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I have a follow-up question, but I don't know if others have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Let Councilmember Thomas go, and then we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Thank you for appearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Just in regard to the fifth district and aligning it with the other districts, is there a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| cost difference that you can predict at this moment about whether or not it would be cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| for the election commission to make this change, or would it be negligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2261)|
| 0:37:49| This may be an indictment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| But I think given the relatively low turnout of city elections currently, I think the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| would be negligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| I think it would be a little bit, certainly, one way or the other, but I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| anything jumps out at me with regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| I think from a process perspective, it makes it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Councilwoman Parker, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| I don't know if there's anyone here who can speak to the budget, but the budget was also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| something I looked to, to see if we were going to have a charter amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| I believe I remember $200,000 for election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2304)|
| 0:38:36| Can anyone speak to whether we have budgeted for these charter amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| No, I can't really speak specifically to what's in the budget with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2322)|
| 0:38:50| I know there are sufficient funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| If council elects to have a charter amendment on the ballot, there are funds available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2332)|
| 0:39:00| that, and they can be appropriated for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I have a question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| If the regional at-large positions move forward, would there not be a need to amend other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2349)|
| 0:39:17| of the charter, for instance, section 404, that sets up our districts in order to redefine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2357)|
| 0:39:28| our government composition, essentially, to redefine our city council as not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| comprised of district representatives, but comprised of regional representatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| I looked at that, and I conferred with Stephanie O'Hara at MTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Districts are established by ordinance, which, as all of council knows, is much easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2388)|
| 0:39:55| change and would not have to be placed on the ballot with a charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| Every ten years, as everybody knows, there is a census process to go through, and within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| 120 days, your districts, 120 days from the publication of the census, your districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| must be established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| This is a process you go through once every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| The proposal by Councilmember Roberto, I think it would be easy to adopt, assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| the council passes it, puts it on the ballot, and the voters pass it, because it is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| nomenclature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| You are not, for example, moving Ward 11 from District 4 to District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Your changing District 1 would be south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| District 4 would become north, and so on and so forth, to correspond with the geographical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2458)|
| 0:41:07| If we were to propose that we went to an all-district election system, would those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2467)|
| 0:41:17| sections need to be amended then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Yes, because we currently have six districts, and if you went to a nine-district system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| you are taking the same piece of pie, but you are making smaller slices, so you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| have to get into probably a similar process that, for example, now-retired Rick Emmett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| was involved in, where an MTAS was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| You would have to look at the creation of new districts that would have the same population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| within a certain plus or minus percentage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| The process we go through every ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| You would have to do that again if you went from a six-district system to a nine-district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| And those nine districts would need to be defined in the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| No, I think they would need to be defined in an ordinance, like the current six districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| But we would at least need to name that we are creating nine districts and no at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| positions in that section, and then by ordinance we can define the nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| The way Councilmember Roberto's proposal, somewhere in there, I don't remember off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| top of my head, there was anticipatory language in there that if this passed the voters, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| within, maybe it was 90 days or 120 days, council would enact an ordinance that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| basically rename the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| Getting to the geographical, you know, like the sixth district would become the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| the first district would become the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| There wouldn't be a change, wards would not be moved around between different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| So the folks who live currently off of Sutherland Avenue in the sixth district would be east?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2594)|
| 0:43:24| That would be the change of the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| That's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Just for clarity, because you got them swapped a second ago, the first district would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2615)|
| 0:43:42| south, the second district would be west, the third district would be northwest, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| fourth district would be northeast, the fifth district would be north, and the sixth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2629)|
| 0:43:55| would be east, and the reason for those designations is that I think my district colleagues will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| probably recognize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| When you're talking to city voters about your district, when you say, I'm from district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| two, they say, I don't know what you're talking about, and we have to name it something, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2652)|
| 0:44:19| so I think that the best way I could come up with was to make them, you know, directional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| names, and maybe there's a better way to do it than that, but that's what I came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2666)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| There are three proposals before us that we will talk about in just a second, so as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| long as we can postpone that just for a minute, are there any other questions around existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| manner of elections, the state law that was passed, or any process, cost, or timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| changes associated with a referendum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I'm waiting for the next section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Well, on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| So, my apologies if I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| So, we talked, you kind of outlined the six districts, so the additional three at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2714)|
| 0:45:22| what territory would be their responsibility as far as, or what they wouldn't have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| They would just cover all of the districts, so that would not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| We're going to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| I'm jumping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| I like where your head's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2737)|
| 0:45:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| On to that section, though, I think in order of the agenda, we will, I thought that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| are three proposals before us, so I think we go in the order of the agenda and let the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2744)|
| 0:45:53| whoever proposed those, talk us through their perspective on the matter, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| discuss each of the items at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| So, first, I have a proposal that was originally submitted by Councilmember Thomas, item D1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2761)|
| 0:46:09| on our, excuse me, yeah, D1 on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| Councilman Thomas, is there anything you want to give an overview about this, or your perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| on the matter before we discuss it as a body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| I'll be brief, because I think my fellow councilmembers have been aware of the situation in the 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| District for quite a while, and basically, the proposal is to bring the 5th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| into sync with the other district races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| There's been unfortunate circumstances even before the legislature acted, where in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| 5th District, people in the 5th District actually only had the opportunity to run for city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| In the other districts, you had an option of running in your district, and then two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| years later, you could run at-large, but because the 5th District was in all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| at-large seats, we were at a disadvantage to run for office, because that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| came around every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| So it was a disadvantage enough the way it was, the action of the legislature makes it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| just basically totally unfair, because not only would that situation remain, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| voters in the 5th District would only have an opportunity to vote every four years, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| opposed to the city elections coming around in every two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| So I think that's almost obvious, that it's unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| So the proposal is simply to put the 5th District in the same cycle as the other district races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| and then you wouldn't have a question about fairness or unfairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And I will add only one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| There's been kind of over the years, I've observed probably less political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| in the 5th District than in the other districts, and my thinking is that this has probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| contributed to that a bit, the situation, and with the new situation, with the passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| of the legislature, it's just completely unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| And to get on that cycle, there's a bridge period of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| Can you explain that, just where we've all read the packet and are familiar with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| dynamics, but the public may not be as aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| Yeah, in the next election, which would be for the 5th District, which would be in 2027,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2911)|
| 0:48:41| in order to get things into sync, that, as proposed, that term would only be two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2921)|
| 0:48:49| And then in 2029, there would be another election, and that would get us completely in sync with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2929)|
| 0:48:57| all the other elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Now there was an option, and we talked about this, and I gave it a lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| The other way is to make that election in 2027 be six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| There's arguments on both sides, but my thinking is if we had that election six years, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| be 2033 before everything fell into sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| And I'm also thinking a two-year election gives the people in the 5th District an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| to get more engaged, more candidates come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| So I feel quite comfortable that the best option is to make that election two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2967)|
| 0:49:35| to get everything into sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Are there questions on this proposal or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Councilman Thomas, we've had side conversations because we're running at the same time about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2985)|
| 0:49:53| This is an assumption on my part, as I assume that it was, the 5th District was put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| way so it would be five council members being elected one time and four being elected the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| next time, and this would go to six and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Either way, there is a majority that comes on every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| The majority would go from five to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| Any thoughts about that or concerns about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| A couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| I thought that that, originally, I thought that was the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I'm not sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Will, Mr. Johnson, do you have your knowledge of history, know a little bit about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| I think we did look into that issue a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| As best we can tell, there was an elected official, a council member who was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| in 68, around that time period that this change went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| And as best we can tell, a favor was done so that she would not have to run immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| again in an election, and they allowed her to serve a full four-year term before she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| had to run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I mean, I can just see that would be things that citizens would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| It's like, it was five-four, now it's going to go to six-three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Is that going to too heavily sway things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Was there a deliberative thought process about why to do five-four, and it was more to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| someone's first term not so short?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| That's at least what was reported in the newspaper at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Well, that's all the record we have then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| And so, I actually had that same question as well, because that actually leaves you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| with only three sitting council members with what we would consider institutional knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| and six that would be coming on brand new when they're first, if everyone is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| if all the seats are going to now be aligned, there would be new council members coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| on, and possibly re-elected, maybe not all, but some may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| And so, that was one of my questions, and somewhat of a concern as well, so just an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Yeah, I understand that concern completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| One thing, though, is that new members have been coming on in mass because incumbents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| have almost always won, and eventually, that is going to get out of sync.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Like, people might drop off early, they may not run again, so you actually have veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| that will be coming on at the same time as the newbies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| So, like in a six-year cycle, it won't necessarily be newbies as things kind of get a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3152)|
| 0:52:42| bit out of the incumbent arena, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| If I may, you're suggesting that just because there's six at a time doesn't mean they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| all going to be six new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| So, incumbents have virtually always won, but eventually, that's not going to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| So, there will be incumbents and then new people coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| And then, the other thing I would add to that, too, is with the three at-large people, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| have the mayor and you have the city judge, so you have five significant seats in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| All at-large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| All at-large and then six the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| So, in a way, there's more of a balance there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| There's different ways of looking at this, I understand, but that's the kind of way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| looks to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I support this proposal and I had a friendly amendment that I sent in to Rob on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| at three, but not able to process it in time, so I don't even know if it made it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| but when I read it, to me it read, the terms of the office of the six geographically distributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3233)|
| 0:54:04| council members shall expire on the 20th day of December 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| And when I read that, I read point blank period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Charlie Thomas is leaving city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| What is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| So, I reached back out, but we weren't able to have that conversation in time, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| I think it should be written a little differently to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| You're exactly right, and we looked at that and I've had a conversation with Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| and Mr. Swanson and at the meeting on Tuesday, we will tweak that language because it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| I believe that in substance, it probably wouldn't make a difference because of the addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| in the language that says or until another candidate is authorized to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| So in substance, it probably was okay to begin with, but you're exactly right about it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| equivocal, and we already have language drafted, thanks to Mr. Swanson, and I'll present that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| on Tuesday, but good eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| Yeah, as competitive as your most recent race was, we wouldn't want you to have to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| battle again so soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| All right, are there any other questions for item D1 of our proposal submitted by Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3317)|
| 0:55:28| Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| Okay, all those, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| On to the next item, D2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| This item was submitted by Council Member Roberto, so I guess to get us started in discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| for this item, Council Member Roberto, would you give us an overview of why you submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| this proposal and any kind of preliminary points you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and I'll incorporate my answer to Council Member McKenzie's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| as I go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| Simply put, what this proposal does, the regional at-large amendment that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| this proposal, it simply brings Knoxville's charter into compliance with state law by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| adopting a process that's already used and in compliance with state law in 16 other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| It does so in a way that is the least change from what the voters in Knoxville are used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| to because all of our district races run at-large races, too, and so simply put, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Now, to answer the specific question from Council Member McKenzie, all of the at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| races, A, B, and C, there's no change to those at all, except that there is language in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3404)|
| 0:56:53| that if you get more than 50% of the vote, then you can win in the primary and you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| have to go to the regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| That same language is in the regional district representatives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| And so, just like Mr. Frost and Director Swanson had said, we have a framework and an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| that already defines the boundaries of the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| We don't have to make any change to those boundaries, but you know how when you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| I would run, we had a residency requirement or residency qualification to run for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| 2nd and the 6th district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| That's basically what will remain, is that you'll have to live within the boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| of what used to be the 6th district, I'll have to live within those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| And that's the way the 16 other cities deal with it, it's a qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| So that's also easier for our administrator of elections to administer as well, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| instead of checking who lives in what district when they're voting, like he was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| all they have to do is check you and me and make sure we're in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| And so, as of today, with the way that these boundaries would be set, what changes would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| be made to the 6th district or do we know we have that information at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| I wouldn't recommend making any changes to any of the boundaries for the regional at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| We just went through that process, we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| The reason it's in an ordinance, right, is because you have to make changes to it every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| 10 years and you're going to have to make changes to it, if it was in the charter, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| would be much harder to make those changes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| So it would be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| I would not support making any changes at all to the footprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| In 10 years, we'll get another, or not quite 10 years, but when we get another census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| a different council will have to review those and make changes to it, but that's the appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| time to look at those footprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| It's not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| This is designed to be the simplest possible, least jarring, most similar to what voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| are used to that brings us into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3544)|
| 0:59:14| Are there any questions for Councilmember Roberto or discussion of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| So, you know, Councilwoman Parker mentioned it, and it's a question out there about will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3561)|
| 0:59:29| this voting, I mean, we can have pros and cons no matter how we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| I mean, some people like it, some people don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Is there a concern, clearly you don't have one or you wouldn't have brought it, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| but that this could overwhelm the district by everybody running citywide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3585)|
| 0:59:58| Can you say what you mean by overwhelm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| So the point is, you know, I'm at large, so I'm not as worried about this because I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3601)|
| 1:00:09| run at large, everybody all over the city had to like me or at least not hate me and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| you know, get elected, but we have had instances the way it's set up now where whoever finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3615)|
| 1:00:24| first in the district didn't win citywide, and so that rarely happens, but there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3624)|
| 1:00:34| people who had an indication of what the district preferred as their representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3634)|
| 1:00:43| I'm sure you've thought about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| I would like to hear some concern, you know, I think that's going to be something we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| going to have to discuss and we'll have to talk about if the charter amendment, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| goes forward and is on the ballot, those questions will be questions that citizens will ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3656)|
| 1:01:03| because we used to vote at large and then districts were created in the 60s, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| as part of some civil rights movement and some concern about making sure that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| was not only people from certain parts of the community who could elect everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3673)|
| 1:01:21| If you have larger turnout in certain districts, you could have a disparate impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| I understand what you're trying to do, and I really like having served on a body where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| people only worried about their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I really love the fact that everybody who runs for city council has to meet every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| in the city and learn about every district in the city so that you are thinking and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| a familiarity with your entire city, not just the district you represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| So if it sounds like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth, I'm speaking to the pros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| and cons, and I just think we have to be prepared to explain this and be comfortable talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| about it if this goes forward and is put on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| I'm sure you have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| I think that's a great series of questions, which I'll try to address all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| I think your experience on a district-only body is very helpful, and I would love to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| hear from you about how that impacts accountability and other issues that you've seen with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| so I'll turn it around and ask you a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Lawyers are good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| If you think about what's happened already, we have seen a change that has already occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3760)|
| 1:02:52| to our election process, so it's up to us to talk about what system might be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3772)|
| 1:03:02| system for us that gets us into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| So I think the simplest way to explain it to somebody would be to say, the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| you went in to vote for city council, you got to vote for nine city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| It doesn't matter where you lived, it didn't matter what district you lived in, you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| to vote for nine council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Not all at once, because they were in two separate cycles, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| If we do nothing, then you're going to vote for four, so you're only going to have a connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| to four of your representatives, and I do think there are benefits to having accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3816)|
| 1:03:45| for all council members, and so I think that's, if you're asking, like, how do you put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3825)|

| 1:03:56| There may be a better way, and I'm happy to talk about it, but does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| Yeah, I mean, I think that's the million-dollar question, is why are we even having this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3841)|
| 1:04:12| And the discussion is because you used to get to vote for everybody that sat on city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| council, and as of the passage of the new law, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| I think all changes to elections have unintended consequences, and so I understand when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| going this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| To answer your question about pros and cons, I mean, I did see that county commission was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| looking about adding at-large representatives to the Board of Education, and I used to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| we should have them, because sometimes when you are only representing your district, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| all you think about, and the pie is very much looked at, what do I get for my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| not always what's best for the city or the county, so there are pros and cons to both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| but I just wanted to have that out there about why you thought this was important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3907)|
| 1:05:14| What were we losing with the state law change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| And I think just to really put a fine point on it, the purpose of the proposal is to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| us into compliance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| What is before us tonight is actually new language, so I have not read this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| yet, and I just pulled up the agenda to see if I could find it, but I haven't been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| to scroll down to it yet, I should have went a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| But I do see that there are amendments proposed to sections 401 and 402, other sections beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3959)|
| 1:06:10| just the one section amendment that we were provided as council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3970)|
| 1:06:24| So I'll have to read that and come with questions on Tuesday about those changes, but what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| wanted to bring into the conversation is the research that I found from M-TAS and invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=3991)|
| 1:06:41| others to share what their understanding is in terms of at-large voting systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4001)|
| 1:06:59| You can Google M-TAS at-large voting and you'll get to the article that I'm looking into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4019)|
| 1:07:09| and they go through the various Supreme Court decisions to identify what would be a valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| claim that someone might bring to challenge an electoral system arguing discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4037)|
| 1:07:29| And it is something that is not super easy to prove, however, the article from M-TAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4049)|
| 1:07:40| says one ironclad rule can be observed in the at-large electoral system cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4060)|
| 1:07:48| If under the old election system, no blacks or few were ever elected to office, that system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| will not stand constitutional muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| The corollary is that if under a proposed election system, it is likely that no blacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| or few blacks will be elected to office, the system will not stand constitutional muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| Beyond that simple rule, a municipality must also defend against nine objective factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4092)|

| 1:08:34| Among that, you have to look at the extent to which members of the minority group in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4114)|
| 1:08:41| the state or the political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4121)|

| 1:09:08| You also have to look at the extent to which voting in elections of the state or political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4148)|
| 1:09:19| subdivision is racially polarized, the extent to which minority representation has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4159)|

| 1:09:33| Again, when we look at at-large races in the history of the city of Knoxville, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4173)|
| 1:09:43| been able to elect one, so I don't understand how anyone can feel certain that this newly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4183)|
| 1:09:50| adopted system that is being proposed would not help hurt our minority participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| As has been lifted up, the regional proposal may have residency requirements, but we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4198)|

| 1:10:18| If we look at just recent history and all of the effort that many leaders in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4218)|
| 1:10:27| put into supporting Councilmember Gwen McKenzie's election, who came very close to losing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4227)|
| 1:10:36| election against Jennifer Montgomery, who had a well-known name, a realtor, and I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| imagine could have won an at-large race in the primary election, having that background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4243)|
| 1:10:54| as a realtor, having the name recognition, that was absolutely possible, because we usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| do not see candidates in the 6th District who got votes as close to the person who went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4260)|
| 1:11:08| on to win who wasn't from the African-American community, so that was surprising to see someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4268)|
| 1:11:20| get so many votes, and it took leaders throughout the city to come out and say, we have to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4280)|

| 1:11:43| I don't know whether a challenge to the system would be successful in court, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4303)|
| 1:11:51| it would definitely make it more possible that we might be challenged, considering our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4311)|
| 1:12:01| history and considering what the courts have said about at-large voting systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4321)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4329)|

| 1:12:13| I don't disagree that there was concern, and I think that to some degree, and I have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| hearing that there is still some concern, yes, the race that I want for Jennifer Montgomery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| was less than 2,000 votes citywide, but my biggest concern, in a sense, is especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4345)|
| 1:12:36| with the political climate that we see nationally that has really unfolded a lot here in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| last couple of weeks, is removing the right of the districts to signal to the city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4364)|
| 1:12:53| present to them two candidates that they would prefer to see leading their district, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| so I am kind of struggling with that a little bit, and I just wanted to put that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4381)|
| 1:13:11| because what could happen with a citywide on both races, potentially, is the city pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4391)|
| 1:13:22| out two candidates that may not be the popular choice for the people who live in a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| and that is a potential and a reality that I think we have to consider, even though we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| are partisan, we know how that goes in our elections, and so that is one thing that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4413)|
| 1:13:40| really kind of bubbled up to the top here in the last two weeks, and I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| share that open and honestly with my colleagues as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4425)|

| 1:13:54| I will also say, to that point, I mean, I only won my at-large race by 80 votes with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4434)|
| 1:14:03| an African-American man who very easily could have beaten me, so I do not disagree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4443)|
| 1:14:11| everything that is said, and as for partisanship, I mean, as we are a community that is becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4451)|
| 1:14:20| much more partisan, and a partisan divide between city limits and county limits, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4460)|
| 1:14:31| could also be a change in diversity of thought in terms of who gets elected and have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| one-party rules, so all I am saying is no system is perfect, but I hear all these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4478)|

| 1:15:04| eliminate citywide voting at all for district representatives, so I agree with you, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4504)|

| 1:15:16| I like the way we were doing it a whole lot better than any choice we have got at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| point, and so I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| It is a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| I liked districts telling us the top two they wanted and then everybody voting citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| because I thought it was the best of both worlds, but that option has been taken from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| us, and so now we have to decide do we leave it as it is, where it is just district races| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4538)|
| 1:15:48| for six races and three at large, or do we let citizens tell us if they still want a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4548)|
| 1:16:00| say in everybody that serves on city council, and it is a struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I mean, it is a lot to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| I will take a turn, just if it is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| I can't have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4577)|

| 1:16:20| You know, I think these are real risks and concerns to bring up, and so I have thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| about this for a long time, and so I have kind of moved into a bit of clarity on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| I feel about the matter, and I think that this proposal is sound for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| One is I do think it brings us, it does the least amount of, I think you mentioned least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4600)|

| 1:17:14| city council is a product of this approach more than it is other bodies in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4634)|
| 1:17:24| so if you look at county commission or school board that are only district only, those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| least diverse bodies, and I would say some of those members have confidently told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4651)|
| 1:17:40| that there is a very big downside to only answering to your district members, constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4660)|

| 1:18:27| that way, I do know that there, I have had a lot of feedback where we are accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4707)|
| 1:18:35| to other districts because we are accountable, and I think the concern about districts signaling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| their top two preferences to the broader community is real, but I think a primary would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4723)|

| 1:18:57| because it's clear now, but we would have that evidence as well going forward by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| results and the precincts that Mr. Davis outlined, so I guess the clarity I have is that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4742)|
| 1:19:12| I have to choose between being accountable to every person in the community versus only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4752)|

| 1:19:51| line with the great tradeoff that I think is before us, and I think this is a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| approach than what the default is, and so I think there are other cities in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4796)|

| 1:20:26| So I guess to kind of put a pin in it, I totally understand what Gwen's saying, and what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| saying, so we have to weigh, okay, but for whatever it's worth, Councilwoman McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4832)|

| 1:20:55| work really well together, I don't see that on other bodies that are district-centric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4855)|

| 1:21:02| I mean, if you ever watch a county commission meeting, I mean, it's pretty evident, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| seems like a, you know, it's a decision to make, but that's kind of it, so wherever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4869)|

| 1:21:37| most diverse and demographically different than probably in the Old City, and it's, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| know, we've got African Americans, we've got whites, we've got Hispanics, I've got people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4905)|

| 1:21:54| the 5th District, so this concern about diversity and demographics is something that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| I've been involved for, I guess, in this struggle pretty much a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4921)|

| 1:22:11| What I do know is that the system we've had in place has brought us the most diverse city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| council that we've ever had, and the proposal that's on the table is closer to that than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| anything else that we might imagine, and we're much more diverse than the Tennessee legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| that made these proposals to change our election, so again, I don't know how these dynamics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4953)|
| 1:22:42| will play out, but I think I feel comfortable that as far as protecting diversity, the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| we've had and the proposal that's more like the system that we have now would probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| probably ensure that diversity more than any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| If it doesn't, I would hope that the electorate and the body in the future after we're gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4979)|

| 1:23:16| diverse council we've ever had, and this is more similar to that than anything else on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=4996)|

| 1:23:28| I would just say that maintaining a diverse council is, I think, absolutely critical to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5008)|
| 1:23:36| the success of our city, and just like my colleagues had said, the change has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| This is an opportunity to bring us into compliance with state law and provide an option for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| voters to make a decision, and I think what we've outlined is a lot of, you know, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| of the discussion that will be had by the voters, but I think it's, I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| we all talked about this at the time, but I like them telling us what that looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| not the other way around, and just like Councilmember Thomas said, that system, which this as closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5048)|
| 1:24:19| mirrors as you can and stay in compliance with state law, has produced the most diverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5059)|
| 1:24:27| council that we've ever had in our city, and so if I thought that would be threatened by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| bringing something, then I wouldn't bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5073)|

| 1:24:42| has been such that we've had a diverse council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| You know, we've always had an African American in the 6th District representing that seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| since the time that we talked about this happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| As we talked about earlier, we've had to run in citywide races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| There are examples of when there's been, you know, a white person, an African American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5102)|

| 1:25:16| There are a lot of examples of people that have been on council who, you know, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5116)|
| 1:25:28| have tried to make sure that we have as diverse a council as we can, and I think we've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| it to a point now where that's happened, and I think that's wonderful, and we need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| sure we preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5138)|

| 1:26:37| So I'm definitely not opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| I'm just talking out loud and voicing concerns and opinions that I have heard to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| because, you know, we have what we have at this time, unless the people in our city decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| that they'd like to go in a different direction, which gives them another option to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5210)|

| 1:27:08| you know, I was fortunate enough to serve on a lot of boards across the city and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5228)|

| 1:27:24| who is in the sixth district that hasn't served on a lot of boards, that doesn't have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5244)|

| 1:27:37| So what I would say to that, like, like all of us, the people coming after us, if this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| you know, if the voters decide they want to do two at large, is that candidates are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| to have to work really, really hard, really, really hard, because we all know, other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| the at large folks, that even running citywide one, one cycle was a huge, it was a huge undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5276)|
| 1:28:05| So at large, you know, council members, you know, my hat's off to you all, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| is absolutely a lot of work, it is a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| And so again, when we think about this political climate, which we can't control, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| coming from a national perspective, I have a lot of concerns about what the future of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| the council here in the city of Knoxville could look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| And so I would just encourage us all, especially those of us who are going off council, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| I hear from a lot of people that I don't know how you all do it, you know, it's so ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| and all these things, but, and yet there are some challenging days, but there are a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5319)|
| 1:28:44| of days where, you know, people get along, people want to look for common ground and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| common good and come together on a consensus for the betterment of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| And so, you know, I think the voters do need to have that opportunity to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| So just to put a fine point on this, and if this goes forward, if council approves this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5348)|
| 1:29:16| on two readings and it goes on the ballot, if it doesn't pass, what we get is district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5356)|
| 1:29:26| races for six and at large for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| So the voters really do have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| It's do you go with what state law now says we have to do, or do you try this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5376)|
| 1:29:44| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| Any other questions on item D2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| We have one more item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| Item D3 was submitted by Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| Councilwoman Parker, would you give us an overview of your perspective on this and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| you submitted it and things we should consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| I submitted this on Monday after having a chance to review the other proposals submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5412)|
| 1:30:21| and when I first read Roberto's proposal, I did not understand that both elections would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5421)|
| 1:30:35| be at large to a citywide vote, and so I had to read that a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5435)|
| 1:30:41| And once I realized that, I was very concerned about that going to an at-large vote, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| I felt like it was not a small change to our charter, but a major change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| And so I went into our charter and made actually minor changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5456)|
| 1:31:05| The section that is presented before you references Section 707 of the charter, and the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5465)|
| 1:31:18| text that is in the charter that would be amended includes A, B, and C that outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5478)|
| 1:31:27| mayor, members of council by district, and members of council at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5487)|
| 1:31:36| And I included all three sections because last time I brought a charter amendment forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5496)|
| 1:31:47| I was presenting a solution to ties in elections and how we could resolve a tie in the primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5507)|
| 1:32:01| because state law mandates that city council must determine, must resolve a tie in a municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5521)|
| 1:32:09| election either by selecting the winner or by calling for a runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5529)|
| 1:32:16| If a tie is to happen during the primary, there's not time for a runoff, and so just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5536)|
| 1:32:24| by changing the language from two candidates with the highest number of votes to the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5544)|
| 1:32:32| with the two highest number of votes, we remove that possibility of a tie happening in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| And so that's why all three sections are in there, because that language was updated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| all three sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| And of course, the judge follows the rules of a mayor's election, so it's for mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| council, and judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| With the district-only voting, that's achieved in the members of the council by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5578)|
| 1:33:11| section, and that was changed by changing five words, that the candidates receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5591)|
| 1:33:21| the two highest number of votes move on to the regular election, and then voters within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| each district vote in the November election rather than voters citywide would vote in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| So that's the only change to that text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| And then in the at-large section, I put the 50-plus-1 rule, language for the 50-plus-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5617)|
| 1:33:47| rule in the at-large section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| So the ordinance serves three purposes, addressing the tie vote in the primary, addressing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5629)|
| 1:33:57| 50-plus-1 for at-large positions, and making district elections district-only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5637)|
| 1:34:06| And in my opinion, what voters have been used to in this city is that you do not go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5646)|
| 1:34:15| up for a citywide vote if you can't make it out of your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| So that to some form, to some degree, district voters are determining who their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| This new system would take that completely away from district voters in determining who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| their representatives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| I think that this is a smaller change and more in line with what folks have been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5676)|
| 1:34:43| to in our elections of the district having a voice in determining who their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5691)|
| 1:34:52| I think it aligns with the Voting Rights Act and runs less of a risk of violating any parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5692)|
| 1:35:02| of that act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| We don't have to worry about whether people identify with a certain geographical region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5706)|
| 1:35:15| of the city to determine their voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| The other regional proposals that have been proposed, I don't think, line up with how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| people view where they live in the city necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| And so to me, this was a better option to present to the voters to address a new election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5731)|
| 1:35:40| system where voters were empowered to select their district representatives and still vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| in the at-large races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| There's more clarity between the roles of a district representative and an at-large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I would also support nine district representatives, but I feel like we need more time to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5755)|
| 1:36:04| in a process like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5764)|
| 1:36:11| I've brought up the fact that we have lacked diversity on council until very recent elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5771)|
| 1:36:21| And we actually came together as a community and formed a movement of people to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| the lack of diversity on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| And we have been successful, and I imagine we have helped influence other elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| I imagine, I mean, one in particular is Lomax, who I was out knocking doors for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| And that was a different strategy than what was pursued previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| People weren't running as teams on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| That's how we get minorities elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| So I don't believe asking your minority community members to form a movement should they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5814)|
| 1:37:02| to get elected to council means that we have accessible elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| I don't think that we can say that the structure that we have in place currently has led to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| the diversity that we have on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| The diversity we have on council is because people have worked hard to overcome the lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| of diversity that we have on this council under our current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| So that's my introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5851)|
| 1:37:37| I have a question related to the tie aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| Can you talk about the pros and cons of having one election where there's three names on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5862)|
| 1:37:50| the ballot versus two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| Or talk a little bit about the tradeoffs that you considered for that aspect of your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| Yes, having been through a process and experienced a tie, it was my experience that voters felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5880)|
| 1:38:11| very disenfranchised once they learned what our process was for a tiebreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5891)|
| 1:38:18| And any time you have a system like that in place, they're going to be very-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| Which is, can you just remind folks that weren't, I mean, don't go into the whole story, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| what is our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| You know, state law requires that city council determines the outcome of a tie or selects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| the winner to go on to the regular election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| City council has the option to vote themselves, flip a coin, or they can call for a runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5918)|
| 1:38:50| And at the time of my tie in 2017, you know, there was a conversation about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5930)|
| 1:38:58| of a runoff, but there's absolutely, we heard the timeline today of when that ballot needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Of course, that's for a referendum, but I imagine a similar timeline to determine what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5945)|
| 1:39:11| goes on that ballot, and there's just not enough time for a primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| And so, I believe, based on my experience of how voters responded to how the tie was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5957)|
| 1:39:26| resolved in 2017, that the preference would be that candidates who tie would move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| to the next ballot for the voters to be able to decide, rather than city council to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| which two people, or which one person goes on the ballot with that one other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| So, I just want to make sure that I have that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| So, would that be a special election with a runoff with those two candidates, or would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| they stay on the ballot with, would those two stay on the ballot with the third person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| The two people who have tied would stay on the ballot with the third person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| Or the four people who have tied would stay on the ballot with the fifth person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| However many people get those two highest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| So, if we get multiple people who all get the same vote, they would all go on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| I have a brief question for, sorry, Councilwoman McKenzie, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Just our two attorneys, is there any conflict of state law with this approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| The fear that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| TCA section 2-8-111 sub 2 provides for how ties are resolved in case of municipal elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6046)|
| 1:40:56| and it provides for the city council, or the municipal legislative body to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6056)|
| 1:41:07| So, that is a law of general application that generally preempts whatever the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6067)|
| 1:41:14| comes up with on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| I meant to mention this a minute ago, but Mr. Davis, is there anything you would add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| to this item or the previous one in terms of how the elections are held or processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Well, let me clarify, because when I brought this issue forward two years ago, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| no conflict with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| And we checked with the state election commission, and there was nothing within state law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| prevented multiple candidates from going on to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| So, would this not be in alignment with state law, because this is city council determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| how we will deal with multiple candidates receiving the same vote in the primary election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6114)|
| 1:42:04| I could see you making that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| I could see the opposite argument being made as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| I mean, the other argument is that we're removing the possibility of a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| By definition, the candidates with the top two votes are eligible to move on to the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6139)|
| 1:42:32| election by definition as we've defined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6152)|
| 1:42:38| That argument might win the day, but as you announced it to us, you said there was a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| you break a tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| And I think that may be what the court decides it is as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| Yeah, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| I would love an opinion from the state election commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Council Member Thomas, speaking totally hypothetically, I wondered what would happen if there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| a tie in the next election, the election you proposed where all three would go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| The city council then has the ability to either select the winner or call for a runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6198)|
| 1:43:26| So at some point, the city council might have to step in if there was an infinite number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| of ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| We're talking hypothetically, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I mean, if it's the regular general election, there's no ballot to move on to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6217)|
| 1:43:44| So at that point, the city council has to make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| But when there's a ballot to move on to, then this would be able to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| So based on that point, Mr. Davis, if the decision falls with city council, if city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| council were to say even if there was not an election that was scheduled, could city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| council say we want a runoff and then set into motion a special election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| Is that a yes, yes or no on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| No, not, well, certainly not in a primary election, which we ran into this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| as Councilwoman Parker mentioned back in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| We have a number of statutory deadlines, we being the Election Commission, that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| to meet everything from absentee ballots to, you know, writing deadline, anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| that has to be done that would, given the current setup of city elections, meaning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| last Tuesday in August for your primary and your first Monday following, excuse me, first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6282)|
| 1:44:48| Tuesday following your first Monday in November, there's simply not enough time in a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6288)|
| 1:44:53| election to have a runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| So, Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson, based on the research information that Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| presented, could you all do some research just to validate further what she stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| when she had reached out that, Council Member Parker, would you repeat that, that you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| that they told you that there was nothing prohibiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Sorry, if you could just turn your mic back on, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| Yeah, that was an inquiry jointly made with Mr. Frost two years ago to the State Election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| Commission and there were no issues with multiple candidates going on to the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6330)|
| 1:45:39| So, there were no conflicts with this Charter Amendment when we shared it with the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6339)|
| 1:45:47| Election Commission two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| Well, I'm just curious, again, speaking somewhat hypothetically, but if three people moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| on to the general election, is there a requirement that the winner gets a majority or would the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| person be able to win with a plurality out of three candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6367)|
| 1:46:12| If it's a general election, state law would just say winner takes all unless there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6372)|
| 1:46:20| in the city charter that other, contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| I'm not aware of anything in the charter that would be contrary to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| Plurality would rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Well, I would imagine so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| However, I'm just going to opine if I can and take the floor for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| A lot of this might be solved and maybe I'm speaking out of turn here, if people would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| I know we have a camera here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| One of the things that frustrated me about the time, 2017, 489 votes, I believe, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| both Councilman Parker and Mr. Tindall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| We had over 15,000 people in that district that did not vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| One of them, one of them could have decided this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| Just throwing that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I don't think you'll get any argument from this body in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6424)|
| 1:47:09| By the way, PSA, early voting has started for many races, so if you haven't voted, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| be hearing from those campaigns until you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| Any other questions for Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| If not, that's the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| Are there any questions left unasked for discussions to close us off with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6448)|
| 1:47:36| Councilwoman Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| Just one final point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Since being elected at-large, we've had a couple of conversations that tend to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| up about, what's the difference between my seat at-large and the district seat, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| all district reps have to run at-large anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| That has been an ongoing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| I think we need district reps and we need at-large reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6484)|
| 1:48:09| I don't understand why we would want to have a purely at-large system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6489)|
| 1:48:18| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| I believe districts deserve to have their own reps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| And that's all I wanted to close with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Councilwoman Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| As a fellow at-large representative, I answer that question with the fact that the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| rep lives in the district and is more in tune with the actual day-in, day-out activity within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6518)|
| 1:48:53| their district, and that as an at-large council person, I feel it's my responsibility to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6533)|
| 1:49:01| to keep up with everything going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| And I think for citizens, whether we like this way of voting, somebody will represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6545)|
| 1:49:11| a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| There will still be people that represent an area who will be expected to take most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6554)|
| 1:49:19| of the phone calls about street lights, potholes, zoning issues, and that's the first point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6559)|
| 1:49:29| of contact for most people in a district is that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| I get less of those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Charlie gets the ones for his area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| You get the ones in yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240718?start=6584)|
