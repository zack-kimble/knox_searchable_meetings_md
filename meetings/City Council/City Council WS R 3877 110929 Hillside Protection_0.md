| 0:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| I know we have a few commissioners and council members that are planning to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| So I'm sure they'll trickle in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| I guess the welcome to the public forum and next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| And I think our first matter of business is to address the issue of how many minutes we allot speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=149)|
| 0:02:37| And also we have a request from the chamber on a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So I think we have a couple of different opinions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| We currently have nine speakers signed up, two of which are chamber speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| And I'd just like to throw it open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| Any comments on allowing the chamber an allotted amount of time for a presentation of Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| versus going along the lines of just allotting signed up speakers an amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=182)|
| 0:03:09| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Mr. Chairman, I think that it would be wise for us to stick with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| which was essentially a public forum with designated time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| If representatives of the chamber want to speak, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| But I would object to an allotted expanded amount of time for a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=205)|
| 0:03:34| We didn't plan on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| This is a public forum, and I think that would be contrary to the intent of the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| Well, I respect my colleague's comments, but we've been sent over the last week or so Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| and some comparisons that we just got today, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| But it seems to me like a number like 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| or something that's modest in size would be appropriate to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| and understand what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| But I'll defer to my colleagues if they want to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| How much time do they need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I think it's 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Fifteen minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Maybe everybody will have 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Maybe everybody will have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| If they have two people signed up and they combine their time, that might fill in the allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| But I would not support having a special presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| We've had a facilitator, and everyone had an opportunity to meet with the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| And we did have agreed rules when we began this investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I would agree with Councilman Della Vopi as far as having a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| if that's part of their time allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I think anyone who is signed up to speak can get up and speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| and say whatever they would like to about any particular plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| But I object to a presentation of this entire plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| For one thing, we don't even know who was involved in putting this plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| We've been here all this time discussing a plan that we knew where it came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| and who worked on it and what was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| And that's a big part of it, at least for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| So everybody's got their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| They can get up and say what they want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| But I am opposed to a specific presentation of Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Yes, I would be in favor of sticking with the original format where people just signed up for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| If particular people want to join their time together, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| But otherwise, I would just stick with the original format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Commissioner Norman, is that a new light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Yes, that's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| I think that also a complication here is that we haven't had time to look at this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| This was not part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| I mean, we just went through the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| And we agreed as bodies to go through this public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| This is a variation of what the bodies decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| And so it would give, I mean, I haven't looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| I mean, I haven't studied it thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| But what I've seen is there are significant things that significant parts of this vary from our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=399)|
| 0:06:50| It will, I consider this a topic that we should probably talk about after the forum is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=410)|
| 0:07:00| how we're going to address this Plan B, what the bodies want to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| rather than allow its presentation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| It's somewhat giving some consent in some form to allow the presentation to even take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=428)|
| 0:07:18| So I think the bodies need to talk about the status of the presentation and whether it's when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| and how we're to do that if we're to include that in our processing now even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| So we've, otherwise, I think we've, I don't know what we've done in the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| So I would, you know, I would say, fine, let them have their five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| or however many representatives from the chamber want to speak for five minutes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Let me ask you, two people in the chamber have signed up, that's ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| Can you make your present, not presentation, can you make your remarks in ten minutes as opposed to 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| That way we're fair to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| We would prefer to, in addition to those two, to sign up Michael Edwards and Garrett Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| who are also here and who are involved in putting together this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| I would note that we have attended every meeting, every joint workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| and have had the opportunity to speak one time for five minutes or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| We would have welcomed the opportunity to have input into this process as you went forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| But this is the first time we've had the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| We're fine with that, but it's not like we've been here and not been commenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| So if we could sign up two additional people, I think that solves the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| We'll try to finish it in less time than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| Okay, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| As a councilman, I think that, obviously, they're going to have 20 minutes now to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| So we're talking about this and wasting time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| So why don't we, if you want to, we can go ahead and have a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| or we can just go ahead and allot the chamber 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| and let one speaker try to be more concise and present it in an orderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| and in a fashion that might be beneficial to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| But I'll remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| So would you like to take a vote, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| I mean, to me, if they're going to have 20 minutes, four speakers, we might as well give them 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| Want to have a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Okay, I'll just go ahead and have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| All those in favor in allotting the chamber 15 minutes to make a presentation, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=576)|
| 0:09:36| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| I believe the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Ms. Wilson, what order do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Who's the first speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=583)|
| 0:10:00| Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| If you could please come to the microphone and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| My name is Casey Self.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I live at 5416 Cedar Heights Road, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| I'm speaking today on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| I serve on the League's Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Our President, Jamie Jobs, is in Nashville and asked me to speak on her behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| The League of Women Voters has watched closely over the years it has taken to create the Hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| and Ridgetop Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| And we commend the task force for conducting an open and inclusive dialogue while formulating the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| We also commend Council and Commission for the care and attention given to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| both separately and in these historic joint sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| You have done due diligence in consideration of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| And it is time to approve it and move on to the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| The League has conducted its own study of local land use issues and has adopted a position statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| We feel the Hillside Plan is consistent with our policy, so we support the plan as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| At the previous joint session, Commissioner Norman offered revisions to clearing and density limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| These revisions are a reasonable compromise in light of concerns raised during your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| And the League supports the amended version of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| In contrast to this reasonable compromise, the Chamber has offered a radically rewritten plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| that weakens protections, eliminates incentives, and fundamentally alters the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=691)|
| 0:11:38| By proposing drastic changes this late in the process, the Chamber insults the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| the governing bodies, and all citizens who have participated up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| That is sufficient reason for you to dismiss their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Examining the proposal's contents raises additional concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| Not only do they propose significant weakening of clearing and density limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| they give the City and County Engineering Departments authority to disregard the limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| It is the Metropolitan Planning Commission, not the Engineering Departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| that has the staff and expertise needed to make such decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| As has been noted by all sides, the Engineering Departments are already overworked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| and understaffed in their enforcement responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| so giving them new planning duties makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Engineering Departments are headed by political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| so implementation and interpretation of these powers would change when administrations change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| bringing uncertainty and inconsistency into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| When power to grant exceptions to the law is given to political appointees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| it opens the door for favoritism and corruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Note also that City Council and County Commission are currently the final arbiters on planning decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| so a shift in the power to the Engineering Departments is an erosion of your own powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| The League of Women Voters requests that you reject the Chamber's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| and instead support the existing plan with the amendments suggested by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=791)|

| 0:13:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Is there a Robin Hill who signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| We'll move to the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| Give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| It's 4-50 and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| My name is Dan Jerrigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| I live at 2101 Johns River Highway, PO Box 20084, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| I've been following this issue since late last year when the Metropolitan Planning Commission rolled this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Basically, it was the first time that I had heard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| It's been going on for two years, and I don't believe that the property owners have been notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| I guess it was noted in this plan that this plan would not prevent water towers, electricity transmission towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=854)|
| 0:14:24| tree harvesting, or protected farming practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| What this plan does is to create more government rules and regulation that will only apply to a fraction of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| and county property owners who were never notified of this change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| What strikes me is the things that the plan does not address at all, and I would like to know the following information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| If I were sitting where you are right now, it's my opinion that these bodies should have requested this in the form of a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| and not a plan because that is what you got was just a plan, but there are no supporting documents or evidence to support that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=900)|

| 0:15:29| A legal analysis prepared by the Chamber of Commerce identified four defects which may open the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=929)|

| 0:15:49| The terms of the MPC plan are not sufficiently certain and definite to satisfy constitutional requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| and the process used for adoption of the MPC plan did not provide the constitutionally required due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| noted to the affected property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=961)|

| 0:18:07| Beyond that, what I haven't heard discussed is the extreme slope of 50 percent is basically unusable land in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1087)|

| 0:20:38| This is not about private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| This is about a vision for the city and the county and about protecting the land and about protecting the people that live on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| The plan B that was presented to you by the Chamber of Commerce that was presented at the end of last week at the 11th hour or I should say at the 11th hour and 59th minute cuts the protected area in half right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1248)|
| 0:21:19| I have not had time or the opportunity to actually read through that plan and look at it, but the short glance that I had at it this afternoon which was the first time I had a chance to look at it indicates to me that its primary purpose is to preserve the profits of the business and developer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1279)|
| 0:21:47| It does not serve to protect the interests of the people and the land in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1307)|
| 0:22:00| A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to drive through a portion of western North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| As you know that's a fairly mountainous area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| It struck me as I was driving down Route 74 and I was going up an 8% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1329)|
| 0:22:18| Now keep in mind that the hillside and ridgetop protection plan only kicks in at 15% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| At that 8% grade my car had to gear down to try to maintain speed going up it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1345)|
| 0:22:34| That was one hell of a steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| That's steeper than the Federal Highway Administration allows for federal highways and yet the chamber and the developer community wants to let anything up to 30% be unregulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:55| I submit to you that on behalf of the 423,000 and some odd people that you support and vote for and achieve a consensus for the hillside and ridgetop protection plan as modified by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1375)|

| 0:23:48| Reading the chamber's plan B makes me sad actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| It feels like a mean-spirited attempt to overturn a process that the chamber actually participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| There were well over 100 meetings to create the original plan along with several public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| Why is it that we're hearing these concerns from the chamber now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| They had plenty of opportunity to introduce these ideas during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| I ask the County Commission and City Council to dismiss this plan because it's ill-conceived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| TCWN opposes the 100% clearing of slopes up to a 30% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| In our experience, developers can hardly keep their sites contained on far less steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| We know that a 30% slope will not be adequately protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Furthermore, according to the maps the chamber provided in plan B, there will be 100% clearing of all of our steepest slopes except for their very tippy tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| TCWN opposes office and commercial development above a 15% grade and is on the record stating that position from the last round of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1484)|
| 0:24:54| The new plan appears to allow office and commercial development up to 50% and above 50% if the proper paperwork is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| In our experience, what is on paper and what gets built may be two entirely different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| Often the built project is the worst project and once it's built, it will never be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1508)|

| 0:25:18| Office and commercial development are required to meet the development standards set forth in plan B but with no density definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| Is the chamber suggesting that office and commercial development have no limits on steep slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| This plan will open a Pandora's box for poor development on steep slopes visible to all and far less charming than a water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| It will open the door for more private property damage of downstream downslope property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| While TCWN respects private property rights, landowners do not have the right to harm their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| Developing on steep slopes has the potential for downstream property damage due to slope slides as we have seen in recent months during severe storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1552)|

| 0:26:58| And that value has just been quantified for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| in a recently completed urban forestry management plan using I-Tree Streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| I-Tree Streets is a program that's developed by the U.S. Forest Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| It's used across the country to quantify ecological benefits of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| Plan B allows for 100% clearing and removal of these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| So to put this in terms of real terms from real neighborhoods throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| the annual benefit per tree ranges from $123 down to $44 at the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| Of that total benefit per tree, stormwater benefits account for a range of $44 down to $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| The ecological benefits come from large trees, not from small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| So if you remove all the large trees and simply plant some small trees, these ecological benefits aren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| This is real dollar value to the city of Knoxville and to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| That would be lost whenever you clear 100% of the site to allow for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| So I hope that you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1700)|

| 0:29:52| we have discussed the hillside and ridgetop plan to some degree or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And three more neighborhoods have voted to support the plan as it was actually written before even amendments were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1797)|

| 0:30:16| The position of the Council of West Knox County homeowners is that the people who own property adjacent to steep hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1816)|

| 0:30:31| that they have a right to not have their property flooded by runoff and to not have their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1831)|
| 0:30:40| particularly those that are downslope, devalued when steep slopes behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1840)|

| 0:30:52| I don't have that much to say today except to ask that you approve this plan with the amendments that were added by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| We are not land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| We are current homeowners, taxpayers, and voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| We would like to maintain our property rights today, and we want to see our tax dollars used for more parks and greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1868)|
| 0:31:17| and better schools instead of used to clean up floodwaters and to dredge creeks that are choked with muddy runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| Trouble spots like this exist all over the county, and they were caused by either poor land management or made worse because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| There's been a lot said recently about how Knox County needs to attract new industry and jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| and the Council of West Knox County Homeowners completely agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| But we think that to become serious about bringing in new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1906)|

| 0:32:16| Three years ago, council and commission put together a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| and asked MPC to assist that task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| And what they asked them to do was to prepare a study of ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| and top hillside protection measures outlining the alternatives for new codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and programs for conservation of these important natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| The chamber 100 percent supports that concept and that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| That's not what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| What you got was an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| You got one document, one legal item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| You did not get alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| You did not get codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| You did not get programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| You did not get a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| We're prepared to support a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| While it's not what you asked for and we don't think it was the right place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| the chamber is prepared to support a chamber amendment as long as it is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and understandable and enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and it balances the right of the community's interest with the rights of property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Very straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| We think that a plan must include protection of hillsides and lower line property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| and sheds from slope failure and erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| It should protect the scenic views, which is what you asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| And what Mr. Donaldson told you at the last meeting, this plan does not address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| So we would add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| We want there to be protection of scenic hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| There should be a reasonable basis for defining the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| It should be clear, concise, and understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| And there should be an objective process for reviewing proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| not let's rezone everything to a plan zone and let MPC decide what they can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| The MPC preface, the preface to the plan says that's what they propose to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2040)|

| 0:34:09| These are technical issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Erosion requires engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| It should require detailed submissions of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| and technical review by professionals in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| And we support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| We're in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2060)|

| 0:34:27| But we're in favor of doing it in accordance with a clear, concise, legal plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| The plan that MPC prepared has a wealth of information in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| and many good concepts, some of which have been adopted in plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| We don't disagree with a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| What we do disagree with is jumbling it together with background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2082)|

| 0:35:25| That's fine, but it's not like this was ignored for the past several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| We've also continued to follow the progress of the plan, hoping it would evolve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| hoping it would be amended to more clearly address some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| And as far as I know, the revisions proposed by Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| and Mr. Donaldson at the last meeting were the first time we've heard any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| And those revisions are not in a legal posture that you can vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| For you to be able to vote on those, they have to go back to MPC and then come back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| So that's the position that we find ourselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| So since there did not appear to be any progress in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| the chamber has had an advisory committee for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| and it asked the advisory committee to draft a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| The advisory committee consisted of Gary Norvell of Betzenheim, Norvell & Poe Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Gary has over 40 years or about 40 years of experience as a professional engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| involved in hundreds of developments, and was a member of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| It includes Chris Ooten and the Shod Companies, a major property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| a major developer in this county involved in many, many, many projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| and a strong supporter of conservation and protection of hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| It includes me and our firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| It includes Robin Askew, and it includes multiple members of the chamber staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| including Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley, Laddie Fields, and Doug Lawyer, who have degrees in the members of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| have degrees in forestry, in land planning, as well as lots of experience in regulatory matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| So that's who wrote Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| There's no secret about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| We think Plan B is superior to the MPC plan in many regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| It includes specific standards for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| It includes a process for engineering review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| It includes the same protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| It adds scenic ridgetop protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| It is tighter than the MPC plan in many regards and actually strengthens the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| We recommend that the county consider requiring permits for any land disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| and get rid of the one acre exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| We think slopes should be based on three acres, not five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| So we think it should apply to even smaller sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| And there are other areas where it actually tightens up the requirements that were in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| So these were not casually thought of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| What we think MPC did was overreach when it started defining the protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2272)|
| 0:38:00| When you look at how things have evolved historically, Knoxville has not been destroyed by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| In fact, Knoxville was founded by developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I was interested in the reference to land speculators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| When you read the history of Knox County, it says land speculators bought this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and the first ones laid out the city of Knoxville 225 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| And where did they lay it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| They laid it out on a ridgetop and the Primo Riverfront lots are on the steepest hillside in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| That's the history of development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| It's hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| That's what developed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Black Oak Ridge, Holston Hills, Lion's View, the ridges, the hilltops are what developed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| That's where people wanted to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Downtown is built on a ridgetop over a steep hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| And these areas have not destroyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| When you look at the cover of Plan B, you look at the beautiful hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| and ridgetops that everyone agrees we should protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| They haven't been massively damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| There are no proposals in 225 years to clear these hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| No one is after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| This isn't an effort to destroy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| It's an effort to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| I'd like to very quickly go through a few slides to show you how much MPC proposes to expand the already existing protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2349)|
| 0:39:18| The first slide shows this is what's in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| The general plan for many, many years has identified this as the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| and ridgetops, if you'll back up to that first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| These are going a little fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Can we get some of the lights cut off on this section up here where that will show up a little better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| This is what has been included in the general plan for many years as the hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| and slopes in Knox County that needed protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| If you look at that map and you look at this map on the wall that's been here since this building was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| you'll find the areas are amazingly similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| These are the areas that are generally considered the steepest hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| the most prominent hillsides in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| The next slide shows you these are the highest ridges in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| and including ridges over 1,200 feet north of the Tennessee and French Broad Rivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| and south over 1,100 feet south of the rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| When you're looking at protecting ridges and protecting scenic vistas, a lot of them you can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| You can only see them if they have topographic prominence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| And the next slide shows you how topographic prominence works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| that if you're beside a hill and there are other hills that are lower that are behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and higher ones behind that, not all of that is visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| and not all of that needs to be in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| So the next slide shows you what Plan B proposes, which is you take the highest ridgetops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| and you take the major arterial roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| And if you can see one of these major or can see one of these ridges over these elevations from a major arterial road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| then that ought to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| And the chamber proposes to protect those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| The MPC plan includes no scenic protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| It includes erosion control and grading and so on, but no other protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| The chamber plan does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| The next slide shows you the comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| This is the current general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| And the next slide is the MPC proposed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| So this is the area that MPC now proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| You see how much larger the green area was than it was on the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| The next slide superimposes the old protection area over the new protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So the new protection area has grown by the amount of the green that you see on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| It has grown to over 39% of Knox County suddenly needs special protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| So this is what we say when we say it has become unreasonable in scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| The next slide shows the chamber's proposed hillside protection area under Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| And the next slide shows that compared to the existing general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| it is very similar to what's been recognized for many years as the critical hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| and ridgetop plans, Plan B actually stronger and including a larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Then the next slide compares Plan B and what the MPC plan proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| As you can see, Plan B is less than 10% of the county, about 9% of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and the MPC plan is almost 40% of the county put in a special protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| This just shows you all three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| So what we would urge you to do is to not get caught up in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| but instead to adopt the best plan that provides the best protection that's understandable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| and legally enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I'd ask Gary Norvell, who's an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| to quickly review with you the difference in a 15% slope and a 20% slope and so on so you have a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| example of how development has gone on here for the last 225 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| I'm Gary Norvell with Batson, Hines, Norvell & Poe Engineers in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2604)|

| 0:43:32| As Tom said, I've had right at 40 years of experience now working in the development community in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| and also the last 12, 13 years in Sevier County dealing with a different kind of terrain up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| And looking at the chamber plan as we went through this, we did, as Tom said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| we tried to break out into two phases, the ridge top part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| and the hillside part because we feel like those are two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| They're not one issue and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| They're two separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The chamber plan is, in the way it is written, is something that can be implemented from an engineering standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| and that's because it's more of an objective plan than a subjective plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| As far as the slopes, 15% to 30% is not a slope that's unworkable, and we recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2659)|
| 0:44:28| I've seen that in the 40 years almost that I've been doing this and dealing with different slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2668)|
| 0:44:37| We've dealt with 30% slopes, 20, 30% slopes the entire time, and those are workable slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| Once you get over 30%, and a lot of it depends on the situation that you're in, too, how much of it it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| and how it's located on a particular site as to how you work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| But certainly there are conditions where maybe something 25 is you've got a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| but you have to look at everything on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| But certainly a 30% number makes more sense than a 15% because 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| and if you all can see this thing here that the chamber has that gives you an idea about what those slopes actually look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2714)|
| 0:45:23| I'll let them set that up and go ahead and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| Tom's talked about the areas that we had on the plan, and we, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| we feel like that a 30% slope is a more important slope at that point than you're getting to position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| into a situation where you have to be more concerned about erosion set of control and stormwater measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2744)|
| 0:45:53| This was the first one being 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2753)|
| 0:46:00| The middle one is a 30% slope, and then this is a 50% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| In regard to the ridge top, as Tom said, we've got in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| we actually do have a defined area that would be designated as, through an overlay process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| as a ridge top for ridge top protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| And it has been decided based on the prominence as far as visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2784)|
| 0:46:31| Go ahead and wrap it up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| I've just got a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| Ms. Wilson, how much time does he have left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thirty-six seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| The first one is Geddes View, which is an existing ñ all these are existing developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| In that particular subdivision, the average slope of the subdivision is 21%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| but there are slopes in it that are up to 39%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| North Shore Town Center, the average slope there is 19%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| but there's areas of it that are at 29%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Whittington Creek has areas of a maximum slope of up to 31% with a 15% average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| Ayers Hall is on a 30% slope average with some maximum slopes of 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2845)|
| 0:47:33| Nolwood, which is on Bearden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| I need you to ñ unless somebody wants to give him some additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| I'm sorry, sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| I'd like to see him finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| If you could go ahead and wrap it up and continue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Yeah, just a few more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| As I said, Nolwood has an average of 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Nobody can argue with the appearance of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| It has a 39% ñ a 29% maximum slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| The Hope 4 or Hope 6 development on Knoxville College, it has an average slope of 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| and that's at a three-and-a-half D dwellings per acre density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| It has maximum slopes of up to 80% and one short area up to 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| And, of course, the city county building where we are now, the maximum slope of it is 22%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So I think these are examples that are very good to show that this ñ that working up to 30% is a very workable slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2905)|
| 0:48:34| But once you get over that, then you have to start looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| Next speaker is Lisa Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| If you could come to the podium, please, and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| It's 525.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| My name is Lisa Starbuck, and my address is 6229 Babeley Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| I'm here before you today in three different roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2941)|
| 0:49:07| First, as a property owner of about a dozen acres of undeveloped land in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| which would fall inside the hillside and protection area, I support the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| and I do not believe that the hillside plan will devalue my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| But instead, I believe it will enhance the value as well as protect my neighbor's property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2966)|
| 0:49:35| In my role as a member of the task force that developed this plan, I'd like you to know that in my professional life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| I am a computer consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| And every hour that I spend on civic activities is actual money out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| As a citizen who has been asked to serve on several different task forces, including the hillside task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| I have spent hundreds of hours of uncompensated time over the last three years working on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| The task force was very careful to consider all the angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| We had engineers, developers, and many experts, both governmental and non-governmental, to help us work on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| I do not believe that anyone was not heard, and I attended all of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| We also visited other cities and looked at their plans for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| In none of the other cities who implemented this type of plan was there any evidence that the plan devalued any property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| or reduced the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| In fact, it was the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Instead of re-admitting the wheel, we looked at what was working elsewhere and how it could be adapted to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| I am somewhat resentful that a powerful entity such as the chamber did not participate in the many months of public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:05| and dozens of opportunities to make their voices heard until the very last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3065)|
| 0:51:12| They chose instead to derail this process at the very end by throwing rocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| misrepresenting a lot of the things in the plan, and presenting an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3078)|
| 0:51:28| I'm not going to address the specifics of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| I have read it, except to say that it didn't have any input, obviously, from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| other than a small group of people in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| I think one of the most troubling aspects of it is that it proposes to take away MPC's job of evaluating proposed developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3106)|
| 0:52:00| and put that on the hands of the already overworked engineering departments of both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3120)|
| 0:52:08| And lastly, I'd like to speak as a neighborhood representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| I am the president of NEPA Neighborhood Organization and the vice president of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| and am on the board of several other organizations, all of which are supporting this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:30| The neighborhoods, as you well know, and a lot of your most contentious issues that come before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| and commission are zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| And a lot of times the zoning issues that cause these contentious meetings are oftentimes to do with density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3162)|
| 0:52:53| And so the neighborhoods agreed to offer the developers a carrot in that one of the things that the plan proposed was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3173)|
| 0:53:09| density bonus so that if the developer did the right thing that they would be able to make more money by increasing the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3189)|
| 0:53:19| And so that's a pretty big concession for neighborhoods to make to agree to allow higher density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3199)|
| 0:53:26| if the developer can show that they're developing the property in such a way that it won't negatively impact everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| And, you know, I really, in that same spirit, I don't see anybody on the other side doing that same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| Anyway, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Do we have anyone else signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Commissioner Bruels, is that your light or your daughter's light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| Actually, it was my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| I had a question for the gentleman from the chamber who were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:05| And I had turned my light on and didn't get recognized and left it on in the hope that somebody would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| So is it okay for me to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| And now is the time for questions, comments by the commissioners and the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| As for the chamber's plan, I still, you know, I've read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3261)|
| 0:54:33| but it's going to be impossible for me to give it any serious consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| until I know exactly who worked on it and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| You gave me a few names and then said, and, you know, a group of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| So I can't tell by that how diverse the group was, who they represented, or what their interests are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| So I would really prefer to have you all send us a list of exactly who worked on this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| and exactly what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| As to how Knoxville and Knox County developed a couple of hundred years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| of course it developed on the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| You know, but today we don't have to be quite as concerned about an indigenous tribe coming to take our scalps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3322)|
| 0:55:33| I don't think that, you know, anyone, these towns were frontier towns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| And anybody who knows anything about military tactics knows you get there first with the most men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| and you get the highest grant you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| And that was how a lot of these frontier towns were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| But that's not what's going on now a couple hundred years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| We have different priorities than they did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| And I understand that you all have had a little fun poked at you this week because of the name of your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3357)|
| 0:56:04| I'm guessing that you all didn't realize that Plan B was the name of an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| But I know that that has also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| We weren't fully aware that we considered this an emergency contraceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3372)|
| 0:56:22| Suggest that you might want to do a little research because I know you got poked, got some fun poked at you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| So I am delighted to know that you all realized what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| But honestly, I don't see how any of us can give this any serious consideration unless we do know exactly who worked on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| exactly where it came from, and what their affiliations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| And if you don't have time right now to go down the whole list, then you can certainly just e-mail that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| But I can't give this any serious consideration without answers to those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| We will be happy to e-mail that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I did list everyone who was directly involved in the drafting of the plan in my earlier remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| which was Chris Uten of the Schott Company, Gary Norvell of Batson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Himes Norvell and Poe, me, Tom McAdams of Bernstein, Stair, McAdams, who are attorneys at law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| Robin Askew, who is an attorney at law, and then from the chamber staff, Mike Edwards, Garrett Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| Laddie Fields, and Doug Lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| And what concerns me about that is that I'm not seeing a lot of diversity in that group in terms of different outlooks on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3455)|
| 0:57:44| we should be treating our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| So that's another major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3466)|
| 0:57:54| I think what one point about that legally is that Plan B is before you in a manner that you can revise it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| you can add to it, you can subtract from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| If there are provisions you think should be in there, you legally can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| include it in the plan and adopt it and send it to MPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| You cannot do that with the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| It can only be voted up or down in its current posture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| You can certainly send it back to MPC with requests for revisions or you can adopt your own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| But with Plan B, you're free to revise it in accordance with comments that you've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| and in accordance with any comments MPC might make or anything else of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| When we get into a debate on a subject, to me it doesn't matter where the information comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| I look at the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| I look at the explanation of it and I can say, okay, this person evidently knows what they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| or they don't know what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| We have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| We've got really four different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| We've got the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| We've got Councilman Della Volpe's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| We've got Tony's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Now we've got Plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| So we're going to have to sometimes sit down and put four of them side by side and pick one of those four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| It doesn't matter who made that suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| but it's picking the one out of that four that's going to be the best for everybody concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I have a question, Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| On the project-by-project review, the MPC plan calls for MPC to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3575)|
| 0:59:44| Your plan asks that codes administration and engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| are you saying that MPC should be taken totally out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| or are you saying MPC along with codes and engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I just need clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| MPC would continue to play the role that it currently plays in reviewing projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| and that is for projects within plan zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| They would continue to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| For projects requiring development plan approval, they would continue to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| And the engineering and codes departments would continue to review what they currently are reviewing in addition to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| other requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Today, when you go for a grading permit, you go to the engineering department, not to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| And these are primarily grading and clearing issues that are being reviewed today by the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| So no change in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| It's not sending something that MPC was reviewing over to engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| Everybody continues to review what they were reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| And engineering would get the additional scrutiny on Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| It also is subject to the state permitting process, which has erosion control measures that have to be applied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| But MPC would continue to play its traditional role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| It proposed a new role for itself, which was that let's put everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| when something comes up for rezoning or land use review that's over 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| let's put it in a plan zone and we'll review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And instead, it stays where it always has been in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| A question for Mr. McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| One of the things that does concern me in reviewing the plan is that you talk especially talking about the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| What's the rationale for zero to 30 percent, 100 percent clearing as opposed to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3688)|
| 1:01:36| Let me get the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And while you're looking that up, it seems to me, Commissioner Brown, that you're right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| that we've got Tony's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| We've got Nick's amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| We have this Plan B in front of us as well as the regular or the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| And it seems to me that it's not a matter of picking one over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| To me, what it is is to pick the best points out of each plan and try to put them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| And so that because I believe that whether it's Tony's comments or Nick's or the chamber's or MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3723)|
| 1:02:10| that what we're all looking for is the best possible plan to protect not only our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| but the ridges and the hilltops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| I'm concerned about one of the things that I would like to see explored further is, of course, the views that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| that the chamber does talk about and the MPC plan I didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| I may have missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| But it seems to me that really from what you're saying that we really do have pieces and parts out of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| And it seems to me that possibly the group that ought to relook at that is probably MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| because it's my understanding, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| and I'll ask the chairman that if there are any amendments made that it does have to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| As I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| But if we take these four and pick the parts, as you said, Dwayne, that fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3775)|
| 1:03:03| then we're going to have number five, which we could send back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| But it's the best plan that incorporates all of the best things out of all four of them and puts it into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| The 100% clearing actually came out of the MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| MPC proposes 100% clearing in the zero to 15% slope range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| And what Plan B did was to take that same concept but to increase it from zero to 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3808)|
| 1:03:36| That was consistent with the engineering review that indicated that at 30% is where you really begin to have a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3816)|
| 1:03:44| The development in rolling hill communities like this is fairly standard development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| subject to existing regulations that have worked in the zero to 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| But where is the point that special scrutiny is needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| And so that's where the extra requirements kicked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| The chamber fully supports the adoption of a tree plan by the county, the tightening up of the city tree plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3842)|
| 1:04:11| additional planning requirements on slopes, totally in favor of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| We just think it's appropriate to include that in your tree ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| and in your codes and regulations rather than in a vague general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| I guess what I was asking, you said that engineering, how did you folks come up to, say, zero to 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| I didn't quite understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| I mean, was this something that where did you come up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| The 30% slope mark was what the engineers determined was the point at which a project really needed special scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| Who were the engineers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| That's what I want to be clear on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| And that was based on their experience in many steeply sloped projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| As far as the plan B aspect, again, I haven't thoroughly looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| And we do have some people that have and have some comments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| We didn't really intend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| I think there should be adequate time for us to do an analysis of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| and its effect and variation from our original plan and our amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| I think Mr. Donaldson could probably speak to some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I don't know whether he wishes to do that today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| I know he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| I think that to me, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| it's reasonable to assume that there are some good things in possibly within this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| But certainly if there are and we adopt the plan or some version of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| say we adopt the plan with our amendments in it, there is also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| there's opportunity for us always to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| This is a process that we do all the time whenever we have a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| And that process will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| I consider this particular effort by the chamber as a, it's a tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| It's a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| It's a diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| And it's an effective diversion if we go down the trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| which we've already started down by allowing the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| And then the questioning of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| So we're starting that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| And in doing that, we are negating the work of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| We're negating the work of the facilitated sessions that we've already participated in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| Now we have another version that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| We're supposed to adjudicate that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| I don't think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| And I object again to that as being part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| We're not negating any of them in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| What we're saying now is we're going to try to pick the best from each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| and put it together in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Anybody have any council members, commissioners have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| If you do wish to speak, turn your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| The choosing of the 30% standard that Mr. McAdams just spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| and you said that you had used your engineers or people within the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| and that it was about 30% where above that is when you started having significant problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4066)|
| 1:07:53| That's not what I've heard in these workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| We've had people who have come up several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| and I specifically have asked them pointedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| is there a problem between the slope between 50% up to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| And we've had people from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| from different schools of ecology who have many years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| and they've said from that podium, from direct questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| there is significant problems between above 15% with runoff, flooding, clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4098)|
| 1:08:26| And so I just don't want the people here to get the impression from what you said, from your engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| that the problems only start above 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| Because that is not what I've been hearing from this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Well, if you remember what Gary Norvell said a while ago, too, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| and each of you have said in cases where that one month it goes one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4127)|
| 1:08:53| six months later it goes another way because of the topography of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| Each piece of ground in this area is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| And to have a rigid, hard, fast document that says A equals such and no more and B and so forth, you cannot do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4141)|
| 1:09:11| You have to look at each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| It might be that a 15% is not, you know, totally clearable because of the problems, the way it lays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| the way it would affect, you know, downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| But the same token, we might even have a 30% or 40% that the way it lays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4166)|
| 1:09:33| and everything maybe it runs straight into the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| You know, you have to take each piece and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| So you can't have one blanket rigid rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| It has to be a rule of thumb or this is a plan to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4185)|
| 1:09:53| The plans, as Tony mentioned a while ago, all of these things are adjustable and amendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| Councilman Del Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Well, you know, I agree with quite a bit of what my colleagues have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| What I have argued for here is that if we are creating a vision statement with some general areas that have to be regulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4209)|
| 1:10:20| like percent of clearing or just the idea of clearing and how much slope to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| we've got to do it in a way that gives us enough flexibility both to prepare ordinances downstream that might be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4226)|
| 1:10:35| than the general approach in a vision-type document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| And secondarily, that we have that safety valve that always should exist in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4240)|
| 1:10:47| which is when you get to the specific facts that Mr. Brown was talking about, it might be that a particular tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| because of the type of the soil, because of the way it lays, because of where the water courses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| because of the quality of the engineering on solving problems that needs to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4258)|
| 1:11:04| And we should have that flexibility as legislators to take that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| I mean, that's why our whole legal system has general statutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| and then courts when people disagree on how it applies in a particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| So as long as we adopt a plan that gives us the flexibility to make carefully fine-tuned decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:25| I think we're in good shape and I would support, you know, going forward with that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Vice Mayor, now that we have had our public forum and the facilitators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| and so that the public will know what will be our next steps in this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| That's exactly where we need to go is next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4304)|

| 1:11:51| I was going to suggest Mr. Hill has asked to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| and I think he deserves the opportunity to do so if that's okay with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| to give him the opportunity to have his five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4316)|

| 1:12:16| And, unfortunately, I got here a little too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4336)|

| 1:12:50| And you and Mr. Ring have said that we represent around 1,000 people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| We also represent the same people that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| All of you are put here to represent a number of people, as you notice when you go through your redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4382)|
| 1:13:11| You will represent all the people and not just some special groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| A lot of those 400,000 people are without a part of being they're not part of the power structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4397)|

| 1:13:27| And I get five minutes and the power structure gets 15 or 20 for its half-time diversion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| But, nevertheless, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Our club likes the plan as it was originally written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| We want to commend you all for having the facilitated discussion between the two bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4421)|
| 1:13:50| And that discussion, I think, was focused on the things that bothered you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| about the plan that we were discussing and have been discussing for the last almost three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4437)|
| 1:14:04| So we've gone through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Some changes, I'm sure, will come out of that discussion, as they should, because laws are made by compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| And you have to have give and take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| That was the give and take part of the exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| So I'm pleased that you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| I think you had a good facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| And I think it was beneficial to both bodies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| I will say that I'm sorry that Commissioner Boyle has left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| but Commissioner Boyle has had with her two of her children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| who are really the people that you're looking at in terms of the vote that you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| We want to leave Knoxville and Knox County as a great place to live, work, and play for future generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:56| and not just us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| It's not about profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| It's not about land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| It's not about intensive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| It's about whether it's a nice place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| This plan, I believe, goes a long ways to solving some problems that we've all seen in spades in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| namely drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| It will also serve to protect the environmental beauty and just the natural beauty of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4518)|
| 1:15:26| It's the area that attracted me because of its beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| And I grew up in Alabama where it's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| I don't like flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| I like hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| We've got them, and they're pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| So when you think about the changes that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| and the plan that's been before you and has been before you for years, remember that it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| It's your vote for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| And the future of this kind of exercise and planning is always subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4554)|
| 1:16:02| You never know exactly how it's going to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| But if you do it right and if you do the best you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| and I think this committee that developed this plan did the best they could in developing a plan that works for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4568)|
| 1:16:16| then you can expect some good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| You don't have to worry about the outcome as being a special purpose outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4579)|
| 1:16:26| It is an outcome that fits the land, and that's what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| So when you vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| and when you get your ideas together, remember that this is for all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| and it's not for next week or next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| It's for generations from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| And I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| It's always an honor to speak to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Having been a member of this group myself for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| I'm always pleased to be here whenever I have an opportunity to be a relevant speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4618)|

| 1:17:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| In terms of next steps, Mr. Donaldson, I'd like to ask you this question and throw this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| And I'd like to preface it by saying that I've been through probably about nine of these meetings, public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4636)|
| 1:17:25| council meetings, discussions, workshops, joint workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| And I think it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| I appreciate all the people's interest and input in coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| And I like to see the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| And I think from the city council standpoint that that's been our trademark for the last number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| that we've had dialogue and discussion and public input, and that's integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| And we've done this all out in the open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| And so we're now to the point where we have to figure out what's the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| And, you know, in terms from my standpoint, you know, further consideration of what's been proposed by Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4677)|
| 1:18:07| you and Commissioner Norman mentioned last meeting we had that the plan, the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4687)|
| 1:18:16| needed work was what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| We have Councilman Della Vopi has come together with a plan, with some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| Commissioner Norman has some amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| We have the plan B now that's come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| And I wanted to ask you from a time standpoint, if we ask you to go match up all the things that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4714)|
| 1:18:48| and to incorporate the city staff and the plans that have been submitted out there that are public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| how long would it take the NPC to go back and put together a, call it a modified plan, call it a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4736)|
| 1:19:07| a plan that incorporates in areas of agreement and, you know, from the facilitator and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| I mean, could we do this by the latter part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Or could you do this, like, in the next three weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| Three weeks may be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| Certainly a month would be much more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| Because we, you know, this has gone on a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| And some of us don't have much more time on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| And we'd certainly like to see, you know, this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| And, you know, we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| We'd like to see it finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| But I guess having heard that, I'd like to hear comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| I know some are strictly opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| But would that be something that we would like to see as a consideration of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| creating some type of new plan incorporating what's been presented to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| And if you'd like to comment, turn your light on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| Councilman Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| My only question is, do they need a little more guidance from what we like and what we don't like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| There's obviously a catch bag of stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| What do they do in the back room when they try to moderate all these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I mean, it seems like they need some guidance from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| These are the three or four points we think you should hit or not hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| But I don't know how we do that, whether we just do that by discussion and a vote or what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Well, I mean, think, you know, you presented yours in a fashion that's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| Commissioner Norman and Mr. Donaldson, who worked on the original plan, know what changes they might make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4848)|
| 1:20:55| And the plan B is it's lined up side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| So I don't think that's that difficult to comprehend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| Well, I guess what I was suggesting is that there might be parts of it that in each or every one of them that this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| likes or doesn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| And I'm not sure that if I were MPC, I would come back with anything other than I've given you my best shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| What do I do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Well, I think it's all a good faith effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| And, you know, it's, you know, to me, as a councilman, I'm trying to chair the meeting and move this along to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4880)|
| 1:21:32| But as a council member, you know, I'd like to see a more concise, precise, cut and dry plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4892)|
| 1:21:42| I'd like to see, you know, a property owner to know what they can or cannot do with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| This is a 78-page version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I think it's too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| I mean, I've got my position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| But I just felt like that, you know, we've gone through this long city-county workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| and we have alternative plans that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| And if we ask the MPC who are professional planners to modify the plan to incorporate what's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| that they could come back to us with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| Then it's up to us as separate bodies or collectively to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| I just want to make two observations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Number one, you know, at the last council meeting we postponed, you know, the south sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| And I fully intend to, you know, to vote that up or down, you know, as planned, as I said in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| So I know the chamber was opposed or not opposed but had, well, I guess they were opposed because they had a lot in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| there that was in the original plan and wanted that, you know, postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| So I did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| But I do not plan, I will not, you know, we're going to vote that up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| I'll assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| And I don't think you're going to have that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| I just think somebody on council is going to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| So, I mean, I just throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| I just don't think there's that much time left, I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| What was wrong with putting them in the format that the chamber did with this one when you got all four of them side by side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4991)|
| 1:23:19| Then you can have, I like A, I like B, I like A here, I like C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| I like C here, I like D here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Put them together in one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| I'd like to ask a question of Joe Jarrett, our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| Mr. Jarrett, I'm not going to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| I want to make sure I understand on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| Knox County Commission has already voted on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| The city has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| And so the vote from the county was to deny the plan as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| But we were told at that time that in order to amend the plan, we had to vote it up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| that we could not make amendments at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| So, I think our position or some of the people on commission's position was let's vote it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| let's take another look at it, let's see if there are amendments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| So, from the county standpoint, procedurally, we would need to meet, vote on any amendments that we wanted to send to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5050)|
| 1:24:23| The MPC would consider that and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| I want to make sure I understand the procedure before I talk further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| I mean, that's a procedure you consistently follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| So, from the county standpoint then, we would need to sit down and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| it may be that we take them item by item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| We look at scope, implementation, project by project review, one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| and determine do we like that or do we want to make changes or modifications and send to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5085)|
| 1:24:53| That may be what we need to do on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| And I'm looking for guidance from Mr. Donaldson whether he could give us some suggestions on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| or whether that would be pretty much up to us to sit down in a workshop setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| and see if we could try to hammer some of these things out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| So, Mr. Donaldson, what are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| The county commission has the authority to initiate their own amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| And you can come to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| It has to be initiated by resolution, by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| So, you can get to that position any number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| But we can make as many amendments as needed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| So, if we wanted to amend ten things, we could and send them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| We don't have to amend just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| You're a past commission of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| You're an amendment being an amendment to the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| And that could be pick and choose from a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| It could be start with plan A and make a list of changes to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5151)|
| 1:26:03| That process perhaps should have a bit of a public process that opens it up to the stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| that have been involved in it for three years in formulating the task force plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| that was ultimately adopted by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| See, I see hours and hours and hours again on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| And in my mind, I don't think we really need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| I think we've got documents in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| We know pretty much what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| But I guess I'm looking for how do we get to that point to have that document to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| Can we just kind of do it all individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| Or can we look to you to help us do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| We certainly can provide that analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| We've seen Nick Della Volpe's comments that resulted from the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5205)|
| 1:26:51| And we worked with Mr. Norman to develop the amendments that he presented as a result of the facilitated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| We received a copy of plan B at 438 Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| And this week, our comprehensive planners are at a planning conference in Nashville for most of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| So we spent, you know, the early part of the week preparing for a presentation that we gave yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| And those planners are still in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| So we haven't had a time, had time to analyze it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| And we didn't see the column comparison that you evidently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| But we can do that analysis and lay it out and make recommendations, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| So you're willing to do that without us taking formal action to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Can we just kind of say, Mark, will you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| And you say, yes, and we can move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| Or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| I spent a college football career catching punts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| I can do it again, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Well, that was one of the questions I was going to ask is whether or not NPC has had a chance to review this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| to make recommendations to us, which you've answered on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| So, but that is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| And the other thing, too, is that I just want to make clear that I absolutely appreciate all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| and effort, Tony, that the group has put into the Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| But I also feel that it's extremely important that with not only your amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| but also with what Nick Della Vope had to say and what the chamber has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| that I really fully believe that all of us are out to get the best possible plan that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| And I'm not particularly excited about approving a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| and then spending the next year and a half or two years amending a plan if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| NPC can come to us and tell us what's good and what's bad, you know, with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| and the other ideas that have come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| And I also think that I know myself, I attended a number of those different facilitator plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| and that in the last couple of days in really getting even more involved with both of these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5333)|
| 1:29:01| that there's some questions that I'd like to send to NPC, you know, in terms of being able to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| I think that it's absolutely imperative that we have some type of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| I don't want anyone to go away thinking that I'm not in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| But I do think that we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| and we also have a responsibility to come up with the best possible plan that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| Even though there's been some last-minute shuffling and last-minute ideas that have come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| I think that we ought to take what little bit of time is necessary to review those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| and come up again with the best possible plan if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| NPC will take a look at Plan B and give us guidance on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Sometimes when you get in these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I've been in a couple of processes where they put a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Have you ever seen a timeline where they put a big old piece of paper across the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| and it's maybe five yards long or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| I'd like to put a timeline on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| And it would have about 150 marks on it of what we've done all the way through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5411)|
| 1:30:22| The facilitated process I thought was getting us to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| I think it helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| I'm not against NPC taking some of this new stuff from Plan B and making recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5430)|
| 1:30:39| I can see the side-by-side right now that's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| There are a lot of misconceptions, misstatements, exaggerations, et cetera, in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| And so I welcome NPC's take on this effort by the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| But for us to go into more process, I mean, this is painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5459)|
| 1:31:07| I mean, it's time for us to step up and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| And it's, I think, I just can't see how that we can lengthen this out anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5472)|
| 1:31:21| I'm not going to object too much to NPC making some kind of comment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| But to go further than that, it's just, this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| I've been in some torturous things with county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| And this is getting close to it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| As we've gone through this process from three years ago, facilitative sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| now we are talking about sending something back to NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| I agree with my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I want the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| I want the best things for our city and our county, our hilltops, ridges, and slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| But I also see that we can spend the rest of our terms in office, perspectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| and commission and council going back and going back and going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| I think if we don't have some really specific instructions for NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| if we send this back to NPC for them to put the plans side by side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| they're going to come back with something and somebody's not going to like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| And we will be sitting through another series of hearings, another series of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| another series of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| So while I appreciate the chamber's concerns now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| I also very much appreciate the work of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| And I think the Starbuck pointed out that people gave a lot of time and hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| NPC gave a great deal of time and hours to get us to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| So I agree that it's time for us to take a vote, get this on to our next issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| We have a lot of things facing both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| And I think we can prolong this forever and never have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I want to agree with Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| And I would like to vote sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| But hopefully when this process is over, we will have one plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| and not have two different plans for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| That would not be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| But I hope that we can get to the point where we can vote on this up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| That's the only comment I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Well, it's the job of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to evaluate a situation like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| and give their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| They took three years to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| We went through a facilitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| There was an amendment to their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| There can be alternative plans coming from Mr. Dellavopi or from the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| but the ultimate job is the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| Now, they have taken all the time that humanly, I think, could be taken over three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| went through a facilitation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| They gave their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| And now we're asking them to reconsider again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| I mean, they've already given their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| And this could just go on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| And I don't see why we can't just go ahead and take the MPC's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Let's have an up or down vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| If we vote it in and there's problems with it, that can be amended in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| If we vote it down, then we can consider another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| But to try to take four plans and try to join them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| after MPC has already told us what they think the best plan is, I just don't see an end to it, to be honest about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| Now, maybe there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| We all want the best plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| But I think the process to me is we're getting out of the guidelines that were set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| The Metropolitan Planning Commission is what we were supposed to be listening to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| And I think we should take their opinion and vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| And if we vote it down, then we consider alternative plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| But to continually to ask them to give an opinion, they give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| Then we continually come back with more feedback and ask them to give another opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| I mean, there's no end to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Mark, can you give us an analysis of Plan B by October the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| My only hesitation is that the week of the 10th is a significant week for our regional planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5742)|
| 1:35:54| It's early in the week is a kickoff event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and our planning staff is tied up pretty much the whole week with that effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:05| which essentially leaves us next week to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| The 17th is your work session, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| We can try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| I would appreciate it if you could because that would be a time for us to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| and really take a look at it and start to look at and try to hammer out some of these details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| I agree with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| We've been doing this a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| I think it's time for us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| And if you can help us with that and help expedite that, I think at our work session on the 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| we could start taking some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| Is it still part of our discussion or intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| I know this was going around somewhere that the two bodies were going to meet simultaneously and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| Are we still talking about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Or I was curious as to that status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| We had thought about that, but the sense I get is that the folks over on the city, you're wanting to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| I mean, soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| And, again, I'm just being presumptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| I'm just trying to read the tea leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| When we, the city council, after the county commission voted it down, it was voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| the city council voted and agreed to meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| And we had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5848)|
| 1:37:29| And I'd like for each council member to go back and read the record, if you were there, and see what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| and see what you proposed that we did, that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| And I'd further recommend that you go back and read the original resolution of what the MPC was tasked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| And then if you go and you look at the preface and you see what the MPC talked about in terms of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| and dialogue, we're doing exactly that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| It talks about, in the preface, about further public review, the adoption of new hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| It was willing to work with the MPC city county staff for a second phase of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| including the drafting review and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| Well, you know, it's been rejected over here once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| We decided to go through this joint body, which this member was vehemently opposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| because we're going to have to go and deliberate on this ourselves again one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| And if you want to go ahead and bring it up next council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| or you want to bring it up, you know, on the date we postponed it, you can elect to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| But I'll tell you, we're doing exactly what most of you wanted to do and some of us didn't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| but yet you want to complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| So, what I'm trying to do is ask the MPC to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| and to consider all the things that we've heard during this whole facilitation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5925)|
| 1:38:50| and to take the pros and the cons and to do an analysis and come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| And I think we owe it to ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| And unless somebody wants to object, then that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| If we want to have a vote up or down, then that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| But we're doing exactly what, you know, we talked about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| And I think some people ought to look at where we originally started on this in order to understand where we're trying to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| So, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| I'm sure that you all operate the same way that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| We had two choices, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| We could not amend one jot or tittle on that day that it came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| The only way we can do anything with this is now make recommendations, send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| and then they bring another document with these recommendations and fold it into that for a vote the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| So, I'm sure you all operate the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| And to answer your question, Commissioner Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| I don't know if you have some suggestions, you know, in the near future how we might come back together jointly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| and after this analysis is done and vote on it, you know, that's the spirit in which we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=5994)|
| 1:40:02| Then I'm open for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| I'm sure the council is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| Well, they'd have to be separate votes anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Yeah, we'll have to go back and follow, you know, each other's charters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| I would prefer to see us meet jointly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| That's why we started this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| And if we could vote together, I think that would be the ideal thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| to try to maybe have a special call meeting and to have both bodies meet together and to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6023)|
| 1:40:32| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Just for clarity, I agree with everything you just said about the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I mean, whether I was particularly for the process as a group, we have proceeded as the majority of people did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| So, I just wanted to clarify that you're exactly right, everything you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| Now, I would like to see, of course, that we do have a common vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6051)|
| 1:40:58| And I don't want to go too lengthy, but my main point is, at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| I think we have to defer to the MPC's judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| And we can give them all the feedback or at least have that the basis of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| And so, I'm not opposed for the MPC, of course, taking in all the input that we've had through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| You know, but we can't just let this keep going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| And so, if the MPC can, in a short amount of time, try to bring all this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| and then hopefully have something consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| and something that looks more like a single piece of legislation instead of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6095)|
| 1:41:43| an elephant put together by a committee, you know, kind of how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| So, I guess what I'm concerned about is all the fragmentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| But if the MPC can come back with something that they feel is consistent, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| I'd like to take a look at it, but I would hope that my colleagues would give a tremendous amount of deference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6115)|
| 1:42:02| to the next recommendation that the MPC has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| Because that's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Councilman Delvaux, please add an old light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| No, actually, it was a new one, but perhaps Mr. Thomas has made the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| I do think it would be helpful to have their view at least on Plan B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| to see what they think is in there that might be useful in their perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| It will come back to what Commissioner Hammond said, I think, which is at some point when we have that input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6149)|
| 1:42:36| we need to say, yes, it's great, or no, add this and this and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| and then vote it and send it back, whatever legal process we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| But at the end of the day, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| These bodies represent the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| And our input is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| And even though we are guided by MPC, we have to make the decision that governs the city and this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| So, Mr. Donaldson, you're going to have to try to have something back like October 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| That will allow us to meet some deadlines and hopefully move forward on our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| I just want to make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| I want to thank you, Vice Mayor and Chairman Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| for the leadership that you're showing dealing with this somewhat difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| But we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| And I just want to thank both of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Only that since we've got a date now, October 17th, for the review, what about another end point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6215)|
| 1:43:45| What about a date for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| Let's find a time for the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| Define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Let's define it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| Your meetings on the city are when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Is it the second and fourth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Coming Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| We need to see how much time it's going to take NPC when they get into it before we can set a date for that final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6244)|
| 1:44:11| He just said October 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| But they may run into a snag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| It might be the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Well, then let's set a date contingent on no snags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| I was going to throw out the notion that since you all meet in the evening at 7 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| that might be the best time that perhaps we meet in November at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| Because the 17th, you know, it will take a little while, I guess, to go through some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| But perhaps the commission could meet with the council at your meeting at a 7 o'clock session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6279)|
| 1:44:47| I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Council meets on November 1, November 15, and November 29, the way it's currently scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6288)|
| 1:44:57| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| What about in what you're talking about, Tony, which I agree with that we do need dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| But why don't we don't meet on Tuesday the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| And maybe that would that be enough time to set up a joint meeting between county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| and city council if we did it on one of our off days, whether it's the 8th or if it's two weeks after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| It's election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| Then do it two weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| I'm sure what we do is poll council members, see if that's, you know, acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| I don't know how you do it, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| What we ought to do is what we've been doing is we'll come up with some dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| and we'll chairman and I will discuss them and then we'll poll the commission and the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| and then we'll find the one where we can most of us can meet and set it as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6346)|
| 1:45:53| As soon as the proposals, the analysis is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Would somebody like to recognize the gentleman at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6362)|

| 1:46:10| I'd suggest if you're going to do another revision of this that nobody has really seen Plan B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6370)|
| 1:46:21| except maybe you all and a few other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| Unless you've got another public hearing that's necessary somewhere along the way before you take a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| What we need to do is post that now that we have it on the websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| So that's available to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| Can we do that at least on the city site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110929-hillside-protection?start=6404)|
