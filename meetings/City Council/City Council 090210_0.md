| 0:00:07| We'd like to ask Ms. Pelow to ask the invocation, and Mr. Frost, since he stood first, will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7)|
| 0:00:19| And let us bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=19)|
| 0:00:21| Our Heavenly Father, we come before you tonight after a busy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=21)|

| 0:01:11| and for his voice of advocacy for not only his sixth district, but for the city of Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=71)|
| 0:01:23| We are so grateful for citizens who love their city and will give of themselves that this may become a better city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=83)|
| 0:01:36| Help us all to be mindful of our roles in that way, whether we are members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| or whether we live in a neighborhood, maybe even an obscure neighborhood, and are just a good friend and neighbor to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=101)|
| 0:01:51| We pray that you will bless Knoxville and bless all of its leadership, that we may make good decisions which make us good stewards of your environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=111)|
| 0:02:04| of your world, and of your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=124)|

| 0:02:52| It's about moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=172)|

| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Items to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Items requested to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| People who would like to move an item to another place on the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| You know, now that you're doing it that way, I actually have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| But I guess what I will do right now is say we should like to suspend the rules to consider 11A immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=213)|
| 0:03:47| 11A is the item dealing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| It's with somebody we used to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| I'd actually like to propose that we have a workshop on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| I want to propose that he still has to sit through all EMC discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Now we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| The motion is to move 11A to be dealt with immediately after items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I don't think we have any consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| So, Ms. Mitchell, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| If you're going to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| I want to move 11I, J, and K to be considered with 12 right up immediately after 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| And I'd like to move 11A right after resolutions dealing with EMCs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| You mean 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| The motion is to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Let me make sure I got the numbers right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| 11I, J, and K to be dealt with right after 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| We will now hear the mayor's report or report of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| We will hear 9A, please, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Excuse me, 11A, not 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| 11A is a resolution honoring former Vice Mayor Mark Brown and expressing to him city council's sincere gratitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| for his years of leadership and public service to the city of Knoxville requested by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| I think we should insist that he at least has to stand up during all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| He needs to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Now that he's a representative of the bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Citizen Mark Brown, 2415 Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| We didn't ask you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| We know better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Speak when spoken to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| He finally gets a chance to get the last word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| I guess I'm, as you all know, I'm not really good with words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| I actually think we should almost get a transcript of Ms. Pillow's prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| That was, I think, very well said in honoring somebody who has led us so long and so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| And even though we have a little more space on this side of the table, we miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| And we're going to miss you a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| And whoever has to fill your shoes is going to fail at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| So we appreciate you and we really thank you for what you did, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| And we wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| Councilman Brown, Citizen Brown, I have to get used to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| I have to get used to this empty seat for a few days, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| Changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| There's something I would like to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| We want this resolution to be yours, and it's certainly in your honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| But as council, we would like to have it framed and have it properly mounted so that it's something that you can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| with you in your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| And maybe you'll think of us occasionally, but we would like to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| So it might be that you'll want to let Ms. Mitchell have do you have something you're going to put in his hands, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=418)|
| 0:07:07| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| So when you do that, you need to return it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Once again, I'm still taking orders from Barbara Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Oh, and I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| Vice Mayor, I just want to tell you that it was a real honor to serve with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And you were very gracious to me when I first came on council, and you brought a lot of wisdom, levity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=447)|
| 0:07:38| And I remember there was this one time when you summarized something really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| and I overheard Councilman Becker go, he can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| And you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| You really we have all benefited from the level of decorum and dignity that you brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| I've benefited from my interactions with each and every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| And I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| I have a slight cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| And it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| I've been the actually I got the better end of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| I got the better end of the deal for serving the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| I got the better end of the deal for getting to know each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| and appreciating your positions, your intellect, your passions, because they help to mold mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| They help to mold my positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| And also, I was noticing in the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| I was looking at the paper online that you have a good slate of individuals from which to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| You know, and I don't envy your task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| And I'm sure you'll do a good job on picking a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| They're all excellent people, and I'm sure that they will carry forward in tradition of other six districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| super six district city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| And thank you all for having me down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| It was not an easy decision, as I guess Susan and Melissa and Cindy can really attest to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=531)|
| 0:08:58| because I actually was in the council office when I kind of got the news I had to make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And it was rather emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| And I particularly will miss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| I miss all of you all, but council staff, Mr. Swanson, I particularly appreciate you guys for your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| and what you all do for city council, not for Mark Brown or for Rob Pelow or, I mean, Rob Frost or Marilyn or Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| or Joe or Chris or, you know, just any of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| But what you do for city council, you do it for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| And you do it for the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And that's what impresses me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| You serve the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| And I want to applaud the staff for that and what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| And thank you, because I don't want to sit up here and let everybody realize that I am warm, soft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| and fuzzy inside, so I don't want to cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| So my wife's here, and my rock is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| My wife's here supporting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| And thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| And I know you'll do well, and I'll be watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| And any time you need some advice with regards to what's going on in the 6th District, you call Chris Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=593)|
| 0:10:02| But if you need a friend, you can call Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| Mark, also, and the council will let vote on this amendment, but we also have a proclamation on behalf of the people of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| the city of Knoxville declaring today Mark Brown Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| And it is an honor to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| It is an honor to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I think about 20 minutes after I first became mayor, you became the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| And I know that my job has been incredibly easier because you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| And you gave me great advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| You worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| You came and did whatever the city asked of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| But more than that, you've been a great friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| And I told Chrissy that night after I came home, after you'd made the decision, I said, this is great for Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| But it's not real good news for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| It's not good news for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| And we will miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| You've contributed greatly, not just your district, but the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| And I'm not just saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| I can't imagine anybody doing a better job than what you've done as vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| So, on behalf of all of us and the city, we are incredibly grateful for your great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| And we will miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| I actually have some proclamations for you here that I'll walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| But I think we're going to get them framed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| And so, at the risk of not having to hug you and get Ms. Mitchell to frame these, rather than walk down there and present them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| I'm just going to give them to Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| We will get these properly framed for you and presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| And then we'll present those to you at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| Here I thought you were about to send Cindy to hug me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I can do that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Joe and Bob and Barbara, also, for serving with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I just, you know, it's been a time in my life that I will not forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| And I hope that in some small way I made some sort of difference, just as you guys are doing every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| And I wish you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| And Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| God bless each and every one of you and your families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And God bless Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Thanks, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| We'll miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=712)|
| 0:12:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Moving to Mayor's report real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Is that next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| We need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| We need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| Now we'll go to the Mayor's report real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| The Mardi Gras Parade, our annual dog parade, is set for this Saturday, February 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| Those of you who were there last year, we had about 350, 400 dogs in the inaugural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| And Smokey Six left us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| This year we have another celebrity, Rudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| The cake-eating, snowman-destroying version of Marley in the movie Marley and Me will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| serve as the grand marshal of the Mardi Gras dog parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| February 21st at 11 a.m. starts at Summit Hill and Central Avenue, right where the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| dog park is going to be, and wind its way through downtown before ending at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| It really was a fun event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| PetSafe Village and Invisible Fence are sponsoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| And the proceeds are going to Young-Williams Animal Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| So, I think that is it for Mayor's report, and we'll move on to Council report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I'd like to recognize David Massey, who came this evening to share with Council, but more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| importantly with the viewing public, some important information from the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| And he did distribute a packet to all the Council members so that you can follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| I'm David Massey, 1129 Burton Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| I just want to alert you to two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| First, as everyone remembers, Council in late December passed an ordinance regulating and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| restricting parking in front yards of single-family residences and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| Part of the City's commitment following that was to provide some education on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=829)|
| 0:13:55| before it goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Working with the Law Department and Zoning and Building Inspections, we have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| a leaflet that will be used by both the inspectors who will be enforcing this ordinance as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| as by neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| Same leaflet, both in English and Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| And so, we have now put that on the Office of Neighborhoods' website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| cityofknoxville.org slash neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| And we're encouraging through our newsletter and other means for neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| to go there, download that leaflet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| and use it in their own education efforts in their own communities where this issue is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| The second thing I want to point out is that the Neighborhood Small Grants Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| which was proposed by Mayor Haslam and approved by this Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| is meant to strengthen the low- and moderate-income neighborhoods in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| Grants ranging from $500 to $3,000 are available to eligible small neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| for projects beginning on or after June 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Projects may include such things as neighborhood improvement, crime-fighting and public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| organizational development, and various educational and cultural activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| We are partnering with the East Tennessee Foundation, which will evaluate the proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| make the awards, and administer the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Applications are due March 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Any neighborhood group wishing to apply needs to send a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| to a mandatory pre-application workshop, 530 p.m. next Tuesday, February 17, at Kansler YMCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=927)|
| 0:15:35| This is a competitive grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| To get a copy of the application form, anyone can call the Office of Neighborhoods at 215-3232| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| or go to the city website, cityofknoxville.org slash neighborhoods to download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| This year, we have expanded the program to include crime watch groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| That's never been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| And to expand the definition of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| And also, for the first time, we are adding a technical assistance component to this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=960)|
| 0:16:08| so that if an organization needs help thinking through their application before they submit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| we will help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Some groups may receive a grant but need technical assistance during the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| We will provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Finally, groups whose applications are not accepted can receive help so that in the following year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| they have increased their capacity to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| and are more competitive in the following grant cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| So, in conclusion, I would just say that neighborhoods are the foundation of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We are no stronger than our weakest neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| And that's why it's important for us as a community to do what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1005)|
| 0:16:52| to encourage low- and moderate-income neighborhoods to help themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| And again, the mandatory meeting, if you want to apply, is February 17th at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| 5.30 at Kansler YMCA at the corner of Jessamine and East 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| Great. Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Thanks, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| We're doing council reports, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| I have something that I think is a bit of a celebration for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| It was pointed out to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| This is the front page of the art section in today's New York Times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| And what do we find on the front page of the New York Times art section but an article about Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| a photograph of the Knoxville Museum of Art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| And it is highlighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| It's a terrific article highlighting the success of Ashley Capps and his Big Ears Festival last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1061)|
| 0:17:50| And then if we turn over to page 7C, the entire page is devoted to the festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1070)|
| 0:17:59| And the exciting thing is that some lovely things are said about our historic Tennessee Theater, Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| And the remark that the reviewer has written here is that this is the best-sounding room in the country, in his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1088)|
| 0:18:19| So it's quite exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| And it goes on to talk about the historic tours in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| And it's just wonderful publicity for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| And wonderful publicity for Ashley and his AC Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| And so I think we can expect great things to happen in the future as Ashley continues to expand his efforts here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1115)|
| 0:18:44| And his reputation seems to be a nationwide reputation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| So I just thought we might all celebrate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| That was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| It was Friday and Saturday downtown were packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| And Saturday night they also had a daddy-daughter dance with fathers and daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| It brought about 750 people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| So it was really a fun weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| So, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I've got four things, I think three of which are quirk and I think one of which is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| One, just for the meeting four weeks from tonight, I guess that's March 12th, I will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| It's going to be my fiancee's spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| And we will be in a cabin in the woods together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| And I will miss you all, but not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Second, this is a little weirder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| There's a lot of talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Hey, it's the first meeting I've missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| We will find you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| Just sort of on a slightly stranger communication note with the Sunshine Law, these things sort of get talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| I know a lot of, I assume everybody on Council is running for Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I just wanted to sort of say that I'm willing to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| I'm interested in doing it and just sort of get that out so there's no speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| Third, we had talked at our meeting a week ago about the rules for electing our 6th District representative Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1195)|
| 0:20:05| And we said we'd have a chance here tonight to see if we needed to rethink anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| My sense is we're in good shape, but we should take a second to make sure everybody feels good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| And then the fourth thing is we probably should talk for a few minutes about rules for electing the Vice Mayor two weeks from tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| because this will pretty much be our last chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| So I guess first, are there just anybody feeling like we need to modify any of the rules about electing the 6th District representative on Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1225)|
| 0:20:35| And Ms. Mitchell, we had seven applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Seven applicants just for the group's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Councilman Hoeklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Well, I'm not responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| Let's wait and see if you get any responses first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| I have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| That's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| This is, yeah, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Anybody, anything they want to change about Mr. Becker's asking about the process that we decided on last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| The process for Vice Mayor we talked briefly on, and it feels like we could take the process we're using for the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1258)|
| 0:21:06| and just slightly modify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| It feels like there were two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I was thinking we probably don't need to say we have five minutes to introduce ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| because we're allowed to speak as much as we want anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| But the public comment period, while there ought to be something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I don't know that we need to say ten minutes per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| We probably can modify that to say there's some allotted amount of time for the public to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| and it gets divided up among whoever wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And my sense is those are ways we can operate on this and want to see what folks think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| And, again, it feels like we did a good thing with the 6th District of saying up front what the rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and it's probably good we do that about the Vice Mayor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| So my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| When the chair would like to make one slight suggestion, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| there are rules on how long a council member can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| And that would be two and a half days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| It's five minutes, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| It's eight minutes for the proponent of a measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| and then five minutes per council member after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| until all council members have been heard from who wish to be heard from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| You just have a gracious chair who's allowed you to filibuster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Anybody want to comment on that in terms of suggestions on the Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| If not, I'm going to assume that you'll be figuring it out when you go if I don't see lights coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I just have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| You're sure we're done with that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| On Tuesday, February 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| TDOT is holding an alternatives meeting on the James White Parkway project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| I believe it's related to the environmental impact statement, the NEPA process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| But it is a public meeting being held by TDOT at South Doyle Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| Again, that's Tuesday, February 17th from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| So that's my announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Any other reports from council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Since Councilman Becker brought it up, maybe we ought to just kind of clarify in our minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| or what I'm thinking is for the vice mayor's election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| is that someone would nominate a vice mayoral candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| and then there would be a second, and then there would be a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Now, if there were a number of them, then we would have a contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| Correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| I mean, this is what I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| And then when it comes time to vote, what we had sort of discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| is that we would have a first round of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and each council member would vote for their preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| And then the one who receives the least number of votes would be dropped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| and we would continue that until we have a winner, a six-vote winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| Is that kind of what we would do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| You've got a combination of two methods there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| One method that's provided for in Robert's Rules would include the nomination from the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| and following that nomination immediately comes a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| There doesn't actually have to be a second under Robert's Rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| just a nomination followed by a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| and keep doing that until you get the requisite number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| which in the case of a vice mayor is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| But that's one method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Another possible method to utilize is to get all nominations on the floor to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Let every nomination come in, which is kind of how we're doing it with the six-district election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| Let all nominations come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Then after everyone is talked out and ready to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| then you take a roll call vote in which each member of council responds with the name of the preferred candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| And then if you don't have five votes for a single candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| at the end of that you drop the lowest number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| whether that's one person or two persons or however many it may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| and then continue to do that until you have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Those are alternative methods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| and it's really up to council to choose your pleasure as to how you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| I mean, I think my suggestion would be we would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| the method we're doing for the sixth district, as I think Councilman Bailey suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| I think actually we might need to modify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| The lowest vote getter is dropped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| because it's entirely possible we have a nine-way tie on the first vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| and that would kind of make things a little more confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| But potentially we can go through a round or two without automatically dropping people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| and see how things shake out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| That would be my only suggestion, but my sense is that's a good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| I don't think there will be a nine-way tie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| because I'm not interested in being vice mayor, for everybody's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| I guess, Mr. Swanson, how do we go about actually deciding what our rules are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| Do we need a motion to do the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| or is this something that the parliamentarian can say, this is how we're doing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| It's really up to you all to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| And so when we arrive at that point, I think somebody needs to be prepared to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| I propose that we do it this way, and then you all express your opinion with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| And if you have a consensus, then we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| Hopefully we won't have a tie at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Hopefully ties will not be possible at that point with regard to two different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Mr. Becker, clarify for me some more about the public input process that you suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| because that feels new and feels different from the other three vice mayoral elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| that I believe that you and I have sat through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| So explore that with me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| It was interesting a week ago, we were talking about electing the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| and I think Councilman Holquist said, what about public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| And it feels like on any given item that council considers there is a public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| or an opportunity for people to sign up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| My understanding is this is going to be at some level an item on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| so people are allowed to sign up and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| And the interesting part gets to be if the motion is to elect a vice mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| who are the three people you speak for and who are the three people you speak against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| I mean, it just seems a little weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| So we need to say somewhat level of, you know, here's how we're going to do the public input piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| It doesn't appear – I actually don't think it's going to be very critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| but people might want to speak to us about the election of the vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| This is only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I mean, in the end, it's council's decision, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| My thought is, unlike most items, you all know each other incredibly well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| and I'm not certain that public forum is going to – other than having people come up and lobby for a candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| I just feel like, you know, most of the information you need on each other, you should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| So that's one person's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| I mean, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I don't want to – I don't know if we could say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| we're not interested in hearing what the public has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| That doesn't feel like a good way to start anybody's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| so I think you just set up a rule on what is the input, and you're clear about what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| And if it's ten minutes to address us, and whoever wants will divide the time up a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| But at some level, to do that seems to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| So anybody else on council want to pursue –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| I mean, to pursue kind of codifying what the procedures are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I would just suggest that, you know, like we're doing for the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| and how all previous vice mayor elections that I've been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| and also aware of, including a contested one where it's 100 percent of the names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| or, you know, everybody's nominated, and then like Mr. Swanson's discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| it's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| The person or persons with the lowest number of votes drops out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| until we get to six in the case of the 5th District and five in the case of vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| Six in the case of 6th District, five in the case of vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| I guess in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| I mean, my sense is that right now people can sign up for five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| and I don't know that, you know, we need six people to sign up and speak five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| Actually, is it – I mean, how will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Mr. Swanson, I guess, help us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| The public forum aspect of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Well, not the – he's saying is this an agenda item that would allow people to sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| to speak in favor or against of an agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| Unless you all choose to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Typically, it would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Not an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| Well, it's on the agenda as elections and confirmations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| but it's not something that typically you have public input into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| I mean, I would –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I'm not saying you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I'm just saying that typically you wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| and you can specifically design a process that includes it if that's what you choose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Would folks on council like to talk about this again maybe Thursday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| after we've done the sixth district and see –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| or do we just want to say now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| As it feels like knowing what the rules are is going to be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| Right now – let me just – can I – right now, just maybe by a show of hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| how many other folks feel like we should have some public comment period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| as part of the nomination and election process for vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| I see one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| I know it's hard to vote against public, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| As you said, I mean, it feels unusual because I've never seen this –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| I just haven't seen this process very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| I haven't seen this happen in our past elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| but on the other hand, I can't imagine this council ever saying to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| that we didn't want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| And I – you know, Mr. Swanson said this would be under elections and confirmations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| and I mean, I think the public is free to speak to any agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| I mean, certainly if the mayor put up someone for a board assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| and the public felt that that person was not qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| then they could sign up to speak during that election confirmation agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| I think what makes it confusing is the agenda item is kind of neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| and then the nominations are more partisan, I guess, for the lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| And so if a public – if a member of the public signs up to speak to the agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| it doesn't really address the characteristics of an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| So that's my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I have real mixed feelings about it because I agree with the mayor that what's most likely to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| is someone's going to just step up and lobby for a particular council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| which I think would be of virtually no value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| and would probably be of negative impact, if anything, under the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| On the other hand, if someone wanted to talk about what they would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| in terms of leadership characteristics, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| I think that's a very valid place for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| What are the chances of that happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| But I hate to just shut off the opportunity for that to happen altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| I'm not interested in the lobbying part at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| I think that's counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| But if someone wants to speak – and we can't tell people what they can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| That's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| I mean, if they get up there and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I want to support so-and-so, how do you stop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| There is e-mail and other ways for folks to let their thoughts be known, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Mostly lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I actually agree that lobbying is not effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| But, again, I think Council Member Holcrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| if somebody does want to speak to the qualifications, the issues, the whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| we're not going to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| It feels like what we ought to say is that there is a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| like any agenda item, people can sign up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| We're not going to say no to speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Clearly, we said we don't want to be lobbied during that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| And I assume we're not going to have an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| but the rules would apply that you could have three people of five minutes each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| who could speak, and that should work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Anybody else want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Mr. –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| Well, just in response to that, I guess we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I think I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I think we could say the rules are if you want to speak to the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| if you want to speak to the kinds of leadership characteristics you'd like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| we'd like to hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| please do not mention the name of any particular council member or candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| That's how you stop lobbying altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| I don't know if we want to do that, but I'm saying we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Any other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| We're moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| We're still right now on reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| 9A, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Article V, Section 10, signed billboards and other advertising structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| and related sections regarding the operating regulations of electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| We do have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| We have three folks in the half for and half against column and two in the against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| I'm going to take the ones in the middle first just in the order that they're signed up in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| You think that one's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| We're trying to get clarification on one of the names real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Well, it's kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| I'll just take all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| First is Dwayne Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2135)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| This is becoming a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| My name is Dwayne Grieve, number 8 Emory Place here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| I'm here as president representing Scenic Knoxville and also tonight as a board member of the Bearden District Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| I'm speaking on behalf of Scenic Knoxville's membership, which over 90 percent live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| Again, rather than repeating the background information that we have already presented to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| that is Scenic Knoxville, in regard to EMCs and the history of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| I would like once again to emphasize to council what our mission is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| And that mission is to preserve and enhance the scenic resources of Knoxville and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| At this time, we're concerned about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| We're most proud of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| We want people to come here to live, to work, and to visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| and are working toward a goal of helping Knoxville avoid what has happened in so many other communities across our nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| and that is visual pollution and clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Our scenic environment is too precious to be destroyed by unsafe, distracting, and unsightly signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2214)|
| 0:37:03| I want to state our position on the proposed ordinance on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| We're in favor of the ordinance before you and would like to see it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| We do understand, though, that there is the importance of the 6th District representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| and would like to see that district included in the final enactment of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| However, let me state Scenic Knoxville's position on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| First, we support the ban on any new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| Second, as to existing EMCs, we support the proposed regulation with a couple of exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| It's our understanding that it doesn't address city-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| We do think that the government and city-owned signs should be included in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| As to the development directory sign, our preference is no EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| but as a compromise we would support the code as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| Our disagreement is that the proposed EMC or a potential proposed EMC of either 375 square feet or 400 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| on both sides of a sign is like two large digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Now, Mr. Mayor, as an architect, most of the times when we do presentations we like to have props.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| And so what I'd like to do is to show you what a sign is that's 14 feet high and 30 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2302)|
| 0:38:30| If you can avoid covering the camera, it would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| You need to move that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| I won't tell you whose sheets these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| But this will give you some idea of a 14 foot high, 30 foot long sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2322)|
| 0:39:03| As you can see, we're not sign makers for sure, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| Okay, you need to pull this part up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| Joyce, you need to move on down further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2361)|
| 0:39:34| You get the point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| 14 by 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| How many square feet is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| That's 420 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I'm sorry, 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| And then, okay, now, who's going to drop the 100 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2398)|
| 0:40:06| Well, anyway, you get the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| If that's 400 square feet, a fourth of that would be 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| So, again, as I said, as a prop, we'd like you to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| So what we're saying, though, is that a sign this large is more, does take on the life of a digital billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2415)|
| 0:40:24| when you look at something that large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| So a standard billboard, by the way, is 14 by 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| And, of course, they vary in sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| But an EMC this large, allowing more than 100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| undermines what is being done with a ban on digital billboards in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| and hits the basic principles of saving our natural resources, adding visual clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| and our concern for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Wayfinding is important, and we need to look at all the areas of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| develop signage design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| and begin to look at what has happened with the proliferation of clutter of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| As I've mentioned before, we have areas of our city that are difficult to find businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| due to the massive amount of signs along the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Scenic Knoxville is not anti-business or anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| We want people to find the businesses in an orderly, non-confusing, safe way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| that are compatible with our scenic environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Banning EMCs and regulating existing EMCs is a beginning in the right step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| As later on, you're going to pass the contract for the downtown Knoxville wayfinding signage project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| which you're going to approve, is, again, a step in the right direction towards signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| Let's continue to work together in the spirit of cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| and remove any potential visual clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| remove the proliferation of any illegal signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| ban any additional digital signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| and continue to work towards a green community by enhancing our natural scenic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| And I also want to add that we have been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and are on continual communication with the Turkey Creek folks and with Arthur Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| and hope to continue that line of communications, which has been open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Mr. Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Council, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| One of the loose ends we're dealing with tonight is the changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| Does scenic Knoxville have strong feelings about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| We've discussed this to some extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and part of our feelings is that the changeable price signs are important for certain types of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| such as gasoline and, you know, in some cases the other areas that you see in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| And so as long as there is definite regulations on those signs in terms of size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2572)|
| 0:43:00| and whether or not, you know, how they change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| as long as they follow with the regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| what we'd like to do is continue to be involved in that decision on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| I am here on behalf of Turkey Creek, I will confess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I am not going to reiterate what I have said the past two weeks to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| I'm sure you all remembered everything I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| but I would like to bring up two or three points here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| First, the goals just espoused by Mr. Greve, we would second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| As I mentioned the first time I spoke to you on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| Turkey Creek has been a leader in this community in business signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| in developing a master sign plan and limiting signage for its tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| and trying to develop a uniform signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| Now, the 375-foot, 400-square-foot sign we are talking about at Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2651)|
| 0:44:20| would fit on the existing development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| which is present on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| That would not be enlarged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| We would have to meet the existing square footage we are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| Turkey Creek fronts on I-40 over 5,100 feet in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| That's nearly a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| If you add the Farragut frontage, it is probably a mile and a half through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| We have one sign, a development directory sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| on which we are allowed to direct people to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| and identify the tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| and there are over 150 tenants in Turkey Creek at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| I would invite each of you sometime when you're out on I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| to drive from Campbell Station Road into Knoxville to Paper Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2717)|
| 0:45:26| I would invite you to consider while you're making that drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| the signage along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| I would submit to you that Turkey Creek is the best along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| It is what we should be striving for here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2738)|
| 0:45:44| There are no pylons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| There's no visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Yet it is the largest commercial shopping area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| not only in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| but in Knox County and in Middle East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| and I would venture to say in all of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| And we have, Turkey Creek has one sign out on the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| for that whole development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So sometime when you're out driving on I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| go east, go west, and look and see what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and consider if Turkey Creek does not have the best signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| To encourage that, we are asking for one EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| and it is one that will be tastefully done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| as is everything else out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| And that would go on our development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| and not result in any expansion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| We're asking for 375 square feet on our development directory sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| so tenants, other than the three already identified out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| can receive recognition from the 50,000 plus cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| that drive that interstate day in and day out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| and so we can capture their business for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| And Robert Bedwell may have just a few remarks if he is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Any questions for Mr. Seymour first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Let me just, when you talk about, go ahead, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| When you talk about the existing development directory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| just let us make sure we all understand what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| That is the sign that is right out there on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| It's got the Turkey Creek logo on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| It's got panels identifying the development, Wal-Mart, Target, and CarMax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| No other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| We're asking that that top part be replaced with an EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| so we can identify other tenants in a state-of-the-art manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| that we think is aesthetically pleasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| and will also allow all the tenants in there at some time to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| be identified to the 50,000 plus automobiles that drive through this interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2877)|
| 0:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Is it an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Where you had a scaled down version, you know, graduated, scaled down version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Because I guess when the concept of 100 plus acres would receive an EMC sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| well, there's only one development that would be eligible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| And, you know, when we talk about, say, the Bearden community or Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| or Magnolia or Broadway or some of these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| where this concept might be considered, there's just not that large of an area where you can get enough people in a 100, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2919)|
| 0:48:48| acre development or site area to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| So you had 100 acres development would be eligible for 400 foot sign and 75 acres for 300 foot and on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2932)|
| 0:49:02| And I don't know if my colleagues still have that, but at some point I wanted to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| And so if you could give us a copy of that or give those that don't have one, I would like to discuss that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| I have one or two with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| What our proposal was is a five to ten acre development that is subject to a master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| And these are just figures we are throwing out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| We get 100 square feet, 10 to 25 acres would get 150 square feet, 25 to 50, 200 square feet, 50 to 100, 300 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2976)|
| 0:49:52| and 100 plus and Turkey Creek is about 350 acres would get 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| That was for purpose of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| I think the master signage plan is a way that perhaps we could all get on board as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| I think in my discussions with Mr. Green, we have discussed that at length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| encouraging those to limit signage but make it tastefully done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| and accomplish the task of identifying the tenants in a development where there is not adequate opportunity to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3027)|
| 0:50:38| on a development directory sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| At Turkey Creek, it would be a couple hundred feet high if we were going to identify every tenant in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| Well, just in conclusion, I pretty much support this just about as we have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| with the exception of the master signage plan, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| considering what you have on the table there and having a good discussion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| and possibly even sending it back to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Having it deleted from here and sent back to the MPC to be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| and to come back to us with some consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| And then I think in the meantime we could talk to some of these areas where you have a lot of clutter and signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3073)|
| 0:51:20| and eye pollution and see if that would be something that we could work with some of the communities on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| I think the future is in a signage program like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| Obviously, you will not get rid of all the clutter, but as businesses go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3092)|
| 0:51:42| and see the benefits of it, I think we can encourage that in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Now, Mr. Seymour, there's nothing right now stopping anybody from going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| and trying to get a master signage plan, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| Well, you can file one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| You have to have all your tenants' approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| You go to MPC and submit it for public review, and they make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3123)|
| 0:52:14| And then it goes to a public hearing at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| I don't think this has happened yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| but anybody who's dissatisfied with the decision of MPC can bring it to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| But, I mean, there's nothing anybody can do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| They meet the minimum guidelines for a master signage plan in terms of the number of tenants and the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| I think you have to have 25,000 square feet of floor space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| And clarify something you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| You're here advocating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| You said for one EMC, 375 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| That's you're not saying it's only going to be visible on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| No, no, it would be both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| I mean, why should we favor westbound traffic over eastbound traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| It would not serve its purpose if it was only on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3188)|
| 0:53:09| I was just wanting to make sure folks knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| And that's how you calculate signage under the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| You get a two-faced sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I think Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| A couple of other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Name and address real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Regarding what Turkey Creek has and what Turkey Creek is asking for and the master signage plan incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3216)|
| 0:53:46| we currently are allowed two of these directory signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| We have chosen just to put one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| And that's what we have consistently done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| That's our agreement we have with Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| And we're going to adhere to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| Also, as part of our offer on the to put an EMC up on and remodel the existing sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3246)|
| 0:54:16| we are going to take down two of the tenant panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| We are currently permitted for six tenant panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| There will be four tenant panels on the remodeled sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3263)|
| 0:54:32| Another point of consideration is the possibility of the scale that we have suggested be applied along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3272)|
| 0:54:42| where you do have the highest possible speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| You have the highest possible minimum ladder size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| And then if you're on a Kingston Pike or you're on a Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| that you have a reduced size maximum because the speed is much slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3294)|
| 0:55:02| and it will be much easier for people to read a smaller sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| I will tell you at 55 miles an hour or 65,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| which is actually the speed limit at the point of this sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| large letters are a must to be able to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Next is Jan Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3326)|
| 0:55:35| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Jan Watson, 8532 Richland Colony Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| I'm here representing just one little business in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| I'm the manager of Strike and Spare Family Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| We've kind of been lost in the shuffle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| We had a sign made the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| You all put a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| My sign couldn't go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| The permit could not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| And truthfully, I've been to several meetings and didn't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| I was under the impression that this was all settled until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| So I'm kind of at a don't have all the maybe all the information that I should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3369)|
| 0:56:18| We are in an industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| There are no homes around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| We're across the street from Beatty Chevrolet on the corner of Parkside and Hayfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| We have a 30-year-old sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| What are we going to do when the sign goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| We have no way of advertising, no way of letting anybody know where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3395)|
| 0:56:47| We do have a sign out on our Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| Bowling Center out on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| I understand that the sign people have been in to see her, and she has gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3415)|
| 0:57:00| The other manager has gone, made sure all the corrections were made, that everything, which also I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3420)|
| 0:57:09| I'm just not sure where the city's going for the small companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| We're not a Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| We're not a Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| We're just a little single business out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| How do we get you want to grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| You want to bring people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| How do we get people to our business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| How do we let them know where they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| I just think I've been lost in the shuffle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And my sign's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| It's ready to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| You know, we're not going to and I continue to see signs going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| I don't know if they're in the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I know that you have fingered a bunch of areas in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| I know that Parkside Drive's been fingered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| I know that we are in the city and that we can't go ahead and put up a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| But I see them coming up everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| I guess I'm just kind of pleading for the little people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| We're not large enough to, you know, we have no way of advertising if I can't put up a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3484)|
| 0:58:14| And my sign is very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| That's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Mayor, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| I really implored Ms. Watson to come and make her comments tonight because that is in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| I do represent her in the area that her business is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And she's in a very disadvantageous location in that there are not other public facilities such as the Bolle Alley there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| She has been in this situation during this whole time of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| You know, I really run out of ways to try to console her and help her personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| But I felt it was very important for all of us to consider this because there are two situations that I know of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| that have just actually fallen within minutes or hours of our moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| And Ms. Watson, as she called this afternoon, she really did not want to speak because she's not a public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| I think she did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| And thank you for that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| But I wanted you all to be aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| I don't know how we fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| I don't know if there is any way to assist her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| But I do feel that it's important that we consider, as she says, small businesses that simply are falling outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3572)|
| 0:59:41| the other considerations that we are making here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| So I appreciate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| And I appreciate you coming because I know it was very painful for you to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| The other thing, where we're located, there aren't any businesses that are like open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3591)|
| 0:59:59| We're not really near the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| We are three or four miles from Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| But it's not like we're centered next to a mall where there is a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| It's a very heavy commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| So it's a very safe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| It's a very well-designed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| It just happens that they seem to be on a little island in this unusual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I guess, Ms. Watson, just to apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| I think I introduced the first moratorium back in the Eisenhower administration when this all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| It's been a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| It's been a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| And it was interesting because we had MPC looking at the digital billboard, which is technically a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| And they said, well, we should clean up some of the language on EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| And we thought while we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3645)|
| 1:00:46| And we thought it would be some minor, you know, partly even just rearranging where things were in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| And we thought we should just make sure nobody falls in in the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| And every time they make one little change, we thought of six more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| I do think we are very close to being finished now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| I don't think we're going to finish it completely tonight because we don't want to do it while the sixth district is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| unrepresented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| But I do think two weeks from tonight we can finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| And the moratorium that's been in since the Eisenhower administration might be finally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| I'll ask her a question for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I think her question to me this afternoon when she phoned me about 515 was what happens to me if you institute a ban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3681)|
| 1:01:32| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| That was your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| I mean, I'm out there where there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| There's, you know, I don't, how does somebody know where to get to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3703)|
| 1:01:44| Ma'am, have you been here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| If it wasn't for city council, it was a city council workshop, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| I have been twice before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| And spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| You've spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Because somebody from Strike and Spare Bull, I thought, spoke at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| No, someone spoke for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Our sign company that's holding our sign, he did speak one night, but I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I've not ever wanted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| And he's called me this week also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I don't think EMCs will be over tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| I figured out EMCs really stand for every meeting considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| He's still holding that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| So he also has been in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Two folks signed up to speak again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Ben, D-O-E-D-E-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| I'm not sure how to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| Doden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Yes, my name is Benjamin Doden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I live at 106 Dawn Court in White House, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| I work for Watch Fire Signs by Time-O-Matic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| We are an industry-leading manufacturer of LED message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| We're an 80-year-old company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| We've been manufacturing electronic displays for over 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| and we have over 20,000-plus installations operational in the United States today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| I do have one question for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Do any of you still use a typewriter on a daily basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| Computers, technology, has replaced older technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| EMCs are the replacements for manual reader boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| They allow a user to quickly and easily change their content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| Ninety-nine percent of our business is manufacturing EMCs for churches, schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| financial institutions, small businesses, and municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| All of our customers have one thing in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| They need to effectively be able to communicate to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| For churches, they would use it to advertise service hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| You know, small business advertise what they have as far as product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| and that they have a sale going on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Municipalities use them for announcing city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| The SBA and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce both have supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| and endorsed electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| A message center is a commercial right to free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| It allows a small business to be able to compete with the big box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| A local hardware store trying to compete with a Lowe's or Menards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| in the same community doesn't have the same economic resources that the big box chains have as far as advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3856)|
| 1:04:24| on television, radio, newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| And the electronic message center gives them a cost-effective advertising medium to be able to communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| to large masses of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| When a small business exceeds, then it allows for more employees, fewer empty buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| and more tax revenue for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| Typical concerns in regards to message centers are the aesthetics, brightness, and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| On the aesthetics, message centers can eliminate banners and temporary signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| They also, a small business doesn't inquire and want to purchase a message center because they're cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| They are a relatively large expense for a small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| but that allows them to get the advertising dollars and bang for their buck that they want to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| It also helps increase the appearance of their property and increases property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| A sign owner's interest isn't served by aggravating or annoying the general public with unattractive signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| It's a way to get attention and draw business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| EMCs weather better and continue to look brand new when traditional signage tends to look run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| They offer a longer lifetime of clean, crisp content, which is an important improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| Zoning allows for you to decide where a message center should be and shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| Do I feel that a message center should be in the middle of a residential area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| But in commercial districts, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| It is a business community, and businesses have the right to communicate to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| The second is on brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| All the signs that we manufacture do have dimming controls, which allow for automatic dimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| whether it's by a light detector or scheduled dimming by date and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| We do encourage, if we can, come to an agreement that that is included in the code so that we don't have signs that are bright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3982)|
| 1:06:31| and obtrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Safety is the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| There's no statistical study or data that exists to support the theory that an electronic message center is unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| I actually have a couple safety studies that have been conducted that actually say the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| Some cases they have actually reduced accidents by effectively communicating the message clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| with the appropriate size copy versus a manual reader board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| which oftentimes uses too small letters and trying to cram too much content on one screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| The manual reader boards also are hard to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| They aren't instantaneous, and oftentimes individuals can get hurt by the letters falling when they're trying to replace it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| The effective use of a sign, you know, oftentimes can be by the hold times, you know, the type of content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4042)|
| 1:07:30| That can all be regulated, just like a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| I can buy a car today that, you know, is more than likely capable of doing over 100 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| but, you know, it's not safe to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| The same goes for electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| I did have a handout that I passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| I'm not sure if everyone received one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| I do have more copies that if anyone needs one, I'd be happy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| give those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| In there is ten facts for a better foundation of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| It's a great readout that has facts about signs, not just opinions by individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4079)|
| 1:08:07| There are a couple case studies, one by a local small business that improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| About 30 more seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Then I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| You have the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| The two studies, the summaries of those studies are both in the packet as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| For those of you who voted yes on the first reading, I strongly encourage you to reconsider your vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| I urge you to allow myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| and other sign professionals the opportunity to work together to write a sign code that will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| for both the business community and the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Ms. Peel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| You know, you just made a comment about did we all have the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| We certainly received it over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| But it occurs to me, Ms. Mitchell, that we are, if we do make a decision to postpone a decision tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4127)|
| 1:08:57| until the sixth district council member is seated, that individual needs to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| we have quite a good bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| And I don't know if you plan to be back with us again if we, if this moves to a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| It occurs to me that some of this material needs to be accumulated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| and everyone needs to get this material to Ms. Mitchell, I guess, in the council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| so that it will be available to the sixth district member because otherwise that person is going to be at a terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| disadvantage and not have the same opportunity that we have had to get this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| So I'm just thinking if you had indicated you had other packets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| it would be helpful to leave that with the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| And then I guess I'm just saying to everybody else out there that if you have something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| in the way of a packet or material that you have provided us in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| if you could reproduce that for this individual, that would be, I think, very helpful to our later discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4193)|
| 1:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| You said you're from Whitehouse, Tennessee, so your business is based in the Nashville area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| I'm a territory representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Our corporate headquarters is in Danville, Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| So you just live in the Nashville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| Does your business have a lot of clients in East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Do you have a significant number of client businesses in Pigeon Forge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| I have a few, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| A good example of the products that you represent could be found or seen readily by Drive-Thru Pigeon Forge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| Yes, there's product there as well as, you know, here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| You do know we've been talking about this for about a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| and that folks involved with your industry have been before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| This hasn't been a one-sided issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Are you aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I was just brought to this just the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| As I said, I cover a large area, and no one had approached me in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| I just got a call last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| Mr. Rick Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4272)|
| 1:11:25| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| Rick Burnett, 9010 Candlewood, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| Actually, I was Ms. Watson's representative in Fill Union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| I think I've had some e-mails back and forth with you and Anita Cash regarding their specific case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| where Mr. Larry Smita purchased the Family Bowl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| and he closed on that property on November the 30th and signed a contract for that sign on December the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| I went down to, well, actually a representative with my company, Janna Sheckles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| went down to the city to Scott Brenneman with a sign permit application as well as a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4322)|
| 1:12:11| told, informed Scott that we had the site plan was incorrect because it was going to be resurveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| because of some right-of-way issues that were related to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4339)|
| 1:12:26| We left the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| He did not, he said to just, he refused to accept it and said to come back when we had the proper survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4348)|
| 1:12:37| We went back up, as you know, the moratorium went into effect on December the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| We went back, I believe it was December the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| and we were informed that there was a moratorium and a permit could not be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| And I just wanted to fill you in on that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4373)|
| 1:13:01| As it stands right now, there are no more than 120, 150 EMCs inside Knoxville city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| and these signs have been allowable for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| I mean, it's the number of new installs won't exceed six to eight units a year in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| You know, even if the amendment, as it was originally submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| to increase the road furniture from 200 feet to 250 feet to qualify for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| if that changed in itself would drastically reduce the number of businesses that would qualify to have one anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| In addition to that, most small businesses can't afford one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| But those that do, telling a qualified business owner that he can't operate, qualify for an EMC is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4424)|
| 1:13:54| like telling somebody that if you've got a touch-tone phone, you've got to go back to a rotary dial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Or if you've got a dishwasher, you've got to go back to washing them in the sink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| You know, telling a car owner that, you know, you've got to ride a horse now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| You can't use the latest technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| You know, for those of you that are Kaz Walker fans, you know, maybe even take fluoride out of a water supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4451)|
| 1:14:21| You know, there are currently hundreds, if not thousands, of marquee signs in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| I'd say less than five percent of them are EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| And for those that argue that EMCs are traffic hazards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I'd like to see some imperative data that verifies that there are more accidents in areas where EMCs are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| compared to those where they don't have EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| As you well know, there's been a moratorium on these for more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| A few more months wouldn't hurt in order to get some data compiled and the facts right about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4495)|
| 1:15:04| And with regard to visual blight or pollution, I love the beauty of East Tennessee, and more specifically, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| as much as anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| But to be realistic and reasonable, you know, we have our dogwood trails, historic areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| nice well-kept neighborhoods, beautiful rivers, lakes, and rolling hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| allowing our small business owners to utilize the latest technology like EMCs to increase their sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4524)|
| 1:15:31| profits, and in turn local tax revenues does nothing to take away from the beauty of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| In fact, it is their right and your obligation as council members to make available any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| and all technological advances available to these business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| including EMCs, to improve their chances of having a profitable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Those are all the folks that are signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I'm actually in favor of postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Even though whoever is going to represent the 6th District will not be nearly as prepared as any of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| I think it's important to have their thoughts or representation on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| It's an important citywide issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| And we'll have an impact on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| And I would like for this to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| So, I mean, I'd like to move to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4600)|
| 1:16:44| But before I do that, let me just hear from what other people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| You can either second or comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Right now there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| I'd like to briefly comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I actually support postponing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| My sense is at the last meeting we started talking about the changeable price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| which has sort of been a is it in, is it not in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| And what I'd like to do is just get some clarity first on the language around changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| It's not clear to me exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| I think we know what we want to do with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| It's not clear whether we do this with this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| So my sense would be to talk about that a little bit and then postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Mayor, I was just going to say along the lines of Councilman Woodhull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| that before we discuss this anymore, I think we ought to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| and bring on the sixth district representative to join us in this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| So, you know, he can pick up, he or she can pick up where we are now as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Well, I will concur with both Councilman Becker and Councilman Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| and Councilman Woodhull's thoughts about including the sixth district council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| And particularly because, and Councilman Woodhull stated that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| because the Magnolia Avenue corridor is of consideration and of great importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| So I feel that that individual would want to have a voice in the final decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| which is going to be, it's going to impact the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| So, but now I'm not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| You did not make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| You just are considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I think that was a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| I will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| I will second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| Now, further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| I do have some questions about the language you've got on changeable price lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| And we can pick it up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| But I think it will be a little more helpful because one of the things we talk about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| if we do make significant changes, it goes back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| And it feels like if the questions are answered one way, we need to make significant changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| and we have to talk about it in two weeks anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| And I would hate to drag this out two weeks longer than it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| But I don't feel strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| Well, that's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Are you saying do you want to talk about the changeable price signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| I just want to make sure it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| The motion on the floor is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Barbara, is that an old line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| Mr. Swanson, can you help clarify where we are on the changeable price signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| Where do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And whether or not this would push us back to first reading again in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| There is language currently in there about changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I would have to have probably more specific questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| I don't know what you want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| I guess going back to what Councilman Becker said, I'd like to get a --- Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| I'd like to direct this question back to you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| Is your sense that the language is inadequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| And, therefore, if we're going to address it, we should try to address that tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| Amend it prior to postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Or I'm not sure how that would work procedurally exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| I think we'd have to decide not to postpone, amend it, and then postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| And if I might, in amplifying an answer to your question, Mr. Holquist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| the language we currently have talks about the matrix area of a changeable price sign being a maximum of 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4813)|
| 1:20:22| And a changeable price sign shows a product or service that's an unchanging element and only the price changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| And the question becomes, does the traditional sign that we think of that lists, you know, regular, premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| and diesel, is that one sign, is that three signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| And does the 20-foot measure the entire area of the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Does it measure the changeable area of the sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Or does it measure area of one of those things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| And I think we know what we want on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| We have some consents on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| And I'm not sure that the language and I'm not sure if the language is clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| And I've talked to a couple of people who don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| And I can't remember, does it specify how often the changeable price sign portion can change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| I believe there's an answer on that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Because I think it shouldn't be more than once every 24 hours, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Actually, it's once every minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Well, I don't think that's acceptable for a changeable price sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| Mr. Becker, you have a number of resolutions that you proposed tonight that we moved forward on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| And one of them, obviously, addresses clarification of changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| Would it be workable for you to postpone 9A as well as 11I, J and K as a unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4893)|
| 1:21:42| and then consider all of this in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| My understanding is your concern that if we make changes in two weeks, then we'll be back to first reading again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| But at least we have the sixth district person on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| And, I mean, at this point, to me, that just, we can do it with the sixth district person on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| And you've already got language here saying that you need clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| So that would allow us to just postpone everything and move forward in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| Well, I just had an indication that somebody had an answer to one of your quandaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| But if we're going to go ahead and postpone, I suppose those answers can be obtained later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| May I offer a friendly amendment to Councilman Woodhull's motion to postpone to add, in addition, 11I, J and K to the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4947)|
| 1:22:34| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I think that was the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| That was accepted as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Let me just throw out, I think the one thing, maybe it's hard you heard from one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| but I've heard from other businesses out there who are like, in the middle of this moratorium, we don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| You know, maybe we're a retailer talking about putting a price sign up and we've been told we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| You know, there is why I think we're right to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| Just remember there's a lot of people kind of, you know, on standby and being told one thing and not sure what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| And because we're not really sure, there's not a lot of direction out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| and it's hard for Anita and her other folks to know what to tell people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Joe, or Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| I think that's a real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| And that's why I want to make sure that we don't find ourselves in two weeks with six district council members seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=4997)|
| 1:23:25| back to first reading, back to, you know, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| We're going to have to send something back to MPC and draw it out and draw it out and draw it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| So, you know, I think that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| We need to keep these folks in mind that the mayor mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| On the addition of 11I, J and K, I think J and K are fine because they're more substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I is actually a resolution form of, Ms. Roddy, your suggestion that we look at the amortization idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5027)|
| 1:23:54| And what was included there is putting that in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| I don't see any reason to postpone I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| I think we're going to ask MPC or somebody to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and this would actually start the clock on that two weeks quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| But I don't feel strongly about that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| But I'd actually ask if we could pull I out and consider that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| After we deal with 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| So is that a friendly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| So, Ms. Poplin, you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Ms. Poplin might have some clarification for us here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| I did want to add that was actually a motion that was made at last council meeting by Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| That's been added into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| And partly I's here, so in case my thought on was if this has to go to second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| we pass this now and we at least start the discussion a little quicker on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| But it's two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| It's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| So is I included or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| Right now it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Right now the motion is to postpone I, J, and K along with 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| Well, let's just go back to why we're postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| We are postponing because we feel the sixth district council member needs to have a voice in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| Why would we want to include a component that is a significant component to this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| I just have a problem with piecemealing what we approve and what we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| So it just would seem to me if we're going to give that individual a voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| that voice needs to include all issues that we will be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| I think it would be simpler for us than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5144)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Everybody understands the motion that's on the floor right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| So it includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| 9A, 11I, J, and K would all be postponed two weeks until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5159)|
| 1:26:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| I have eight, excuse me, seven ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| So all those items are postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| I is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Would you like to correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5187)|
| 1:26:28| I think we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| But, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| I think we're okay either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Just for clarification, Ms. Pilo would like to be an aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| 11B is a resolution in support of policy governing development of the green space of the city county building subject to approval by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5197)|

| 1:28:21| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| I just really have a problem with doing the signage itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| But it just seems like $114,000 is an astronomical amount of money to spend to plan and design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5310)|
| 1:28:38| I don't know how many signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| I haven't been able to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| I wouldn't expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| The signs themselves would cost $114,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| I'm going to let.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| You know, and that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| I'm going to let Madeline Weil come in because she's been in charge of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| and part of the group that's been working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Let her come address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| And Ann Wallace from our department also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Let me just, before I answer Mr. Hall's question directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| let me give you all a little bit of background on what the project is because the scope of the project really does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| of course, that's what drives the price to where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| But you all know that downtown stakeholders love downtown and they're very proud of downtown as we all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| The one thing that people have mentioned time after time to me that we really need to improve in downtown is the signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5368)|
| 1:29:36| particularly the signage that is aimed at visitors to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5376)|
| 1:29:42| You all know that we have plenty of parking in downtown, for instance, but people can't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| And I'm asked all the time by people wandering around, you know, how do I find Market Square?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| How do I find the city county building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| And I'm willing to bet that some of you have had the same experience in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| So that's the problem that we're seeking to solve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| We spent a lot of time figuring out what we wanted from this consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| and we did a lot of research on what other cities have done for wayfinding programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| talked to a lot of project managers to get an idea of what the scope is here, what some of the hurdles are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5415)|
| 1:30:22| what some of the challenges are, and then what the results have been of other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| in cities that have done similar endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| So we spent a lot of time developing a scope of services to put into the request for proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5431)|
| 1:30:38| thinking about who the audience was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| and it was clear that the audience was both pedestrians and people in vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| We wanted to help visitors feel welcome downtown and also impressed with downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| And we wanted to have a consultant that would help us put a system in place that would stand the test of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| In other words, one that works for right now but also evolves over time to change as downtown changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| and then also can be expanded to other districts like the Cumberland Avenue district, downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| and possibly others as we go forward with different plans in the adjacent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5472)|
| 1:31:19| So we had a number of stakeholders who helped us develop the request for proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5479)|
| 1:31:26| KTSC was involved, the convention center, CBID, CAT, the MPC, lots of downtown departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5486)|
| 1:31:34| And we ended up putting out an RFP that got 23 responses, which was the, according to Boyce Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| that's the most responses he has ever seen for any RFP that he's done since he's been in that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| So it's a very competitive market right now, and the reason for that is that lots of cities are doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| So I just, getting directly to the question, Mr. Hall's question of cost, I have a spreadsheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5512)|
| 1:32:01| Thanks, Anne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| That just shows where the costs fell for all of those 23 proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| And you'll see we negotiated with Merge to get it to a level that was significantly under the average for all the proposals that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5528)|
| 1:32:21| But the committee that we put together, you know, made up of those same stakeholders that I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| overwhelmingly ended up choosing Merge as the most responsive and most impressive of all of those consultants that did respond to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5547)|
| 1:32:38| And I passed out some pictures earlier just before council of some of the work that they've done for other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| So the things that we were really impressed about the work that they did includes how organized they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| They have a very good procedure for getting the job done, a really strong public input process, stakeholder input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5571)|
| 1:33:00| And then they took very seriously the idea that we were committed to making this a project that stood the test of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5580)|
| 1:33:11| They also took very seriously the challenge that all cities faced with respect to budget and committed to working with us to phase in the project if we needed to over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5591)|
| 1:33:27| Councilman Hall, did you have a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Do we have any indications to what this signage package will cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| Well, Mr. Frost asked me the same question earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| And that depends on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| It's going to be an iterative process with these consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| You'll see in your package there the pictures that I passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| There are a lot of different sign types that these guys are going to help us create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| If we want to do several large and signature gateway signs, for instance, in the entrances to downtown, obviously that's going to drive the price up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5634)|
| 1:34:07| And so the stakeholder process in working with this consultant is going to give us a package that may have different phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5647)|
| 1:34:17| But we're going to get to sort of the phase one is going to be something that we're comfortable with the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| I'm guessing that we can get a pretty good basic wayfinding system up for a couple hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| I anticipate going to the CBID and KTSC to help us bear the cost of the fabrication of the signs and the installation of the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5670)|
| 1:34:40| But we could also have something that has a price tag in different phases that's quite a bit beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5680)|
| 1:34:50| depending on what, as a community, our final package looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5690)|
| 1:35:00| Anything else, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| As well, I'm not sure if I'd share all of Councilman Hall's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| but I am concerned about what we're getting for our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| And I think a wayfinding package with wayfinding signage and wayfinding tools is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5714)|
| 1:35:23| One of my concerns is that leaves us with a terrible clutter of ugly, trashy-looking signs all over downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5723)|
| 1:35:32| If our standard parking signs and our standard street signs, et cetera, all those other signs don't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| And some might argue that we are, our hands are tied because of the, what is it, the MUTC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| or whatever that federal manual is for signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| But, in fact, we know that there are cities that do a great job with all those signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| Greenville, South Carolina, does an excellent job, for instance, with their street signs in their downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| And what I would like to see is us take a comprehensive approach to our signage in downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| and not just wayfinding, where we still have lots of other signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| some in inappropriate places where they're blocking sidewalks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| You know about all those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| And what I'd like to see is us have a comprehensive approach to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| even if it costs a little bit more to deal with the problem overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| and to have good signage throughout downtown and not just wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Is there a way that we could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| And I realize we probably can't as the contract is structured right now because it's just wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| But it seems like we'd get more bang for our buck if we did it as one package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| and got those consultants who know the standards, know what can be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| know best practices nationwide to give us a comprehensive package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| So, just to clarify, you're talking about regulatory signage, like our parking signage and our street signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5819)|
| 1:37:00| You're correct in saying that that's not a part of the existing scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| It is really focused on wayfinding signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| And it really is somewhat of a different animal because of the MUTCD standards that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| But we know that cities have been able to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| And Greenville is one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| And the East Tennessee Community Design Center is actually working on a project right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| that will help us get a handle on that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| and figure out kind of what the best practices are from different cities around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| and how we might be able to apply some of those to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| We, in the RFP for this project, for the wayfinding project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| we noted that that process was underway with the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| And there absolutely is a desire to, whatever this process produces in the wayfinding arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| to have changes that are made to the regulatory signage if we do go down that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| Eventually, it should have a consistent design appearance and an overall aesthetic consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5884)|
| 1:38:15| So I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| But how do we get there with the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| The design center is a great organization, does great work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| and we're fortunate to have them on tap to do what they've offered to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| But I'm not sure if that's going to get us where we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| and need to be in terms of having a comprehensive package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| I'm not necessarily suggesting that we amend this contract now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| but I'd like to know if the potential is there to do an addendum later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| or something where we can get the professional help to finalize a comprehensive regulatory package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| that's integrated with the wayfinding package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| I certainly don't think that this consultant would abduct us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| eventually enlarging the scope of services that we're asking them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| So I think it's very possible that we could do that if that winds up being the direction that we choose to head in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| Voice 7 isn't here, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| But based on your conversations with him and your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| do you think that we could do the addendum with them without going back to a new RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| or would we have to go through the RFP process again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| You may not know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| We would have to look at the scope of it and see what the actual RFP that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| If it was not outside the scope of the proposal, it would have to go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Well, you see my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| I think there's an opportunity here, and I'd hate to miss that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Who prepared the current system that's in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| There may be somebody in the room who has a more detailed understanding of that than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| But my understanding was that it was done in the last couple of months of the previous administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| and it was a job that was fairly exclusively managed by PBA and the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6009)|
| 1:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Other questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Well, Mayor, and I've talked to other people about where this has gone on in other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| and they were very much pro wayfinding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| And in terms of the cost, it's very much a pro-business efficiency, getting around quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6032)|
| 1:40:41| It helps shape the impression people have of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| It makes people move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| It helps people move around more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6045)|
| 1:40:47| And I think it's a good thing in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| I do see where Councilman Hulkus is going in terms of maybe elimination of other signage and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| which might even clear this up and make it even more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| So I don't know in terms of the contract if we can postpone it or delay it or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6058)|
| 1:41:04| have a little time to talk about some of these other things that we could incorporate to make this even more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| Madeline, is there a time pressure that we need to approve this if they want to delay it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| and have, of course, we'd probably have to go back out for another RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| I think is what Ms. Poplin is telling us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| Yeah, we would have to look at the scope of the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| and see if we have any flexibility to add that as a component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| I believe the RFP is actually, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| It's Exhibit A in your packet, and it was quite clearly, in my recollection, specific to wayfinding signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6091)|
| 1:41:44| We did mention regulatory signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| but it was only in the context of noting that this other investigation was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| and that we did have a desire to align the two goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6112)|
| 1:42:00| Mr. Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Well, I'm not sure that there is anything we can do short of going back out with a new RFP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6123)|
| 1:42:09| and I think we would need to weigh that, whether or not we really want to go that route or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| But it may be worth postponing for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| So I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| so we'll get a better idea of where we stand and what the options are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Let me ask you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Maybe I missed the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| What's this going to do to this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| I think, and Ms. Poplin, tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| we're going to check and see if we can revise the scope and then council could consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| or if we have to go back and start the process over again and do another RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| That's what we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| So this would allow us time to see if the scope could be revised without starting over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| and then two weeks from now council would have the decision of start over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| and revise the scope or we'll take what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| And there's no problem with postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| If we decide in two weeks we want to pass this contract, we haven't missed a deadline, we're not in trouble, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| No, we're not in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| I'm going to vote against the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| And the reason is, while I understand the desire for integrated signage overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6197)|
| 1:43:24| I think in this unique economic situation we need to think, I need to think about the greatest impact of our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6204)|
| 1:43:33| And as Ms. Weil mentioned, wayfinding seems to be an issue in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| And I want visitors and shoppers and people who have money to spend to be able to find where to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6219)|
| 1:43:46| And I don't, you know, as Mr. Hall said, the cost just for this limited study that's limited to wayfinding is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6226)|
| 1:43:54| significant investment, and that's before we manufacture or purchase any of the manufactured signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| So, you know, in my mind, although a coordinated, you know, citywide effort is a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| I don't think it's something that we can afford to implement at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6248)|
| 1:44:12| whereas implementation of an initial effort at least gets us some wayfinding for people who might have money in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6252)|
| 1:44:21| pocket to support our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| So I'm going to vote against the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| Mr. Alquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Ms. Peebles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| Well, just in response to what Ms. Roddy said, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| It's not that I don't share your concerns, I just don't think that two weeks is going to make a big difference, A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| And, B, if we have, if we look at a comprehensive approach, it certainly could, and we decide to go that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6277)|
| 1:44:44| it can be phased in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| But if we don't know where we're going, they'll sing, if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| In other words, if we don't decide and deliberately take a course of action and say this is where we eventually want to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| we want to have a comprehensive package, we're going to be making piecemeal decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| And it gets much harder to get where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Well, I'm certainly not going to repeat what Ms. Roddy has just stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| But, you know, I'm sitting here thinking these are difficult economic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| and particularly for the city of Knoxville and the state of Tennessee and for our budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| And I'm also feeling the need for some wayfinding in the area where we need to be promoting business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6323)|
| 1:45:33| and right now doing all we can to offer all the assistance we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| And, you know, that figure is just interesting to me because it's pretty close to the figure that we were looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| for the cat lift facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| And, you know, I just have, I don't know, that just came to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| And I'm glad it did because I think I'll be voting against a postponement also for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6354)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Ms. Wild, could you tell us what these signs are going to be locating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| We've heard a lot, there's been a lot of talk about businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| and the conversation I have with you is that they're not going to be telling you where any particular business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| The best practices in doing visitor wayfinding don't list any particular business names because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| as you know, that is a constantly evolving thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6390)|
| 1:46:36| So what sort of standard procedure is to list public destinations that are of a public interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6396)|
| 1:46:45| So City County Building, East Tennessee History Center, Knoxville Museum of Art, the Tennessee Theater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6405)|
| 1:46:54| the Beezer Theater, Market Square, the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| These kinds of destinations which are not private businesses but public attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6418)|
| 1:47:06| So you're right about they will not list individual private business names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| As to where the signs will be located, that's part of the scope of services that this consultant will help us determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6431)|
| 1:47:21| There's an art and a science to wayfinding systems in downtowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| and a lot of thought and analysis goes into exactly where these signs are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| and what destinations are highlighted on each one and the routes that they encourage visitors to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6453)|
| 1:47:44| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Madeline, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| A month ago we passed a Knoxville Tourism and Sports kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6468)|
| 1:47:57| How does that fit in with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| We didn't want to hold them up in their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| They've got two kiosks, as you all are familiar, planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| One for right next to the Visitor Center on Gay Street and then one for the middle of Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| And that's an electronic product that is interactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6495)|
| 1:48:27| and a visitor could go up and search for a Mexican restaurant within a mile radius of where I am now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| and it would give you directions and say, I want to go golfing somewhere in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| Golf courses would pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| So it's very interactive and electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6524)|

| 1:51:02| located on Washington Avenue between Winona Avenue and Bertrand Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6662)|

| 1:51:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| This comes at the request and unanimous, I believe, consent of the Park Ridge Neighborhood Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6678)|
| 1:51:26| This includes the block on Washington Avenue where HGTV helped our community to make a significant investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| in renovation of some homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| Other Councilmembers may want to sponsor this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| I'm aware my colleague, Mr. Frost, mentioned that this is wholly within the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| and I know we've had some discussions about postponing those kinds of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| All this does is recommend that MPC study this request that came from out of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| and recommend to us whether or not it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| I'm comfortable initiating the study because it will come back to us before a final action is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Well, I'm certainly in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| We're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| We've done this in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6723)|
| 1:52:04| Old Sevier neighborhood initiated the same kind of action fairly recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| so I think it's a very appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6728)|

| 1:52:51| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Yeah, I just want to fill folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| Mr. Timms has been wonderful in talking to the neighborhood about putting an office in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| which the neighborhood was fine with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| A little more concerned about this going to a commercial as opposed to an office designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| The Neighborhood Association is meeting between this meeting and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| so I'd like to pass this on first reading with the knowledge of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| the neighborhood will potentially have some issues at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And the neighborhood is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I know Mr. Timms is here that he's done the right thing on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| and we don't object to the project he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| This is a longer-term question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| I was just curious about what the project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| It's an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| And my sense is you're looking to repair this as a rehab the house into an office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6814)|
| 1:53:39| and then lease it or sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| So it's an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| And in a way it's kind of a perfect thing when we first looked at it for the potentially new 04R4 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| and it's going to continue to look as a house but be an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| And yet you do want a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| Well, actually, when I went to apply as per Mr. Becker's advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6838)|
| 1:54:03| when I found out how to go through this, the MPs, the folks at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| Thomas Timms, 7901 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| I guess it was MPC at the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| They suggested that I ask for a commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| So I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| I don't need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| I want to put an office in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| The interesting thing on this is the sector plan, if you notice, it says this is planned for commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| There is an alley that runs next to his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| Currently we're running parallel to central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| And what MPC has said is, as a rule, they want commercial going back to that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| So there was some logic to this happening in commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| This is not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| My first thought was, oh, those MPC people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| And as soon as I thought about it, I was, no, they're actually doing the right thing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| And, again, I think this is going to work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| and that's why we have two meetings and lots of time for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| We're actually also going to ask for it to close that alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| It's a travesty now, and it's a liability to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| And they would very much like me to close it, to apply to have it closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| It's a paper alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=6925)|

| 1:57:20| Now, this is a, what is it called, a food waste processing facility or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7040)|
| 1:57:28| There is a use on review which was approved to put in the back corner of a small building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7048)|
| 1:57:37| to house a food waste processing center that the KUB was requiring them to do before the factory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7057)|
| 1:57:47| that's on the adjacent piece of property dispenses their food waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| their food manufacturer, into the sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| What we're looking at here is the rezoning of the property to I-2 so that the adjacent piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7079)|
| 1:58:09| which now owns this piece of property and plans to, and is zoned I-2, plans to do a one lot on the two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7089)|
| 1:58:21| and to add on to their industrial facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| So they want it to be a consistent zoning, and so that's why they're applying for I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7110)|
| 1:58:31| I mean, I certainly know where Pleasant Ridge Road is in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| Generally, what's the food processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Custom Foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| Custom Foods is the name of the facility, the factory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| You know, this is right across the street from some residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| Are you concerned about smell if it's a food waste processing facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| No, it's a food manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| They make soups, don't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| Yeah, they make soups and sauces, and they're existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| They've been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| They are just planning on adding on to their facility on this adjacent piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| and they want it to be consistent zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| I think that's just the byproduct of their production of soups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| I think it's just a byproduct of their production of soups and sauces, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| And that's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| It's already in process in terms of permits and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7162)|

| 1:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| I actually think we had already voted on that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7172)|

| 2:00:45| My name is Carol Borges, and I live at 2511 Adair Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7245)|
| 2:00:50| Can everybody hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| You've been speaking about very detailed things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| We're going to, like, talk about something, like, huge now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| In the last week or so, I am a reporter for the Enlightener newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| which is the only African-American paper in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| and everybody should at least know that it's for sale at Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| and participate in possibly reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| That's my plug for my paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| But in the job of reporter, I'm going to a lot of different meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| And last week, I was in a meeting at the Time Warp Tea Room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| talking about the economic summit and talking about the stimulus package that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| to eventually be coming to our county and to our state, our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| and also at the Beck Center where people were meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| And there is a general murmur, and that's what I'm here to represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| of people who want to know, is there going to be a grassroots community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| into what happens to this money when it does arrive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| People have used terms like shovel-ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| This is like, it's got to be shovel-ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| It's like, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| And so I think it's time for some kind of a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| I guess what people were hoping for would be some kind of assurance that there would be some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| of community input into what happens to those monies that are going to possibly be coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7332)|
| 2:02:19| Also, in regards to the same thing, the mayor went to a mayor's convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7339)|
| 2:02:28| Would you call it a mayor's convention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| The U.S. Mayor's Conference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| And so I guess people were kind of wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| We hear of what other mayors have presented as their wish lists, it's called, in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| And we were just wondering, was there some kind of wish list that we've missed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7364)|
| 2:02:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| I'll address both of your issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| They asked, in terms of infrastructure needs, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| the only thing we turned in were roads and bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| Their shovel-ready term was, the Obama Administration asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| projects that were ready to go within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| That means the right-of-way had already been acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| The work could start within the four-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Steve, can you correct me if I go out of bounds anywhere here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| But we could literally start the project in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| So it had to be something that was already on our drawing board in terms of the capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| So we turned in a list, and that was basically just for the infrastructure needs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| Is that online anywhere, the capital funds projects list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| Is our capital improvement project list online, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7413)|
| 2:03:39| The list that we submitted to the U.S. Conference of Mayors is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| and I can give her that link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| And going back and referring to your first question in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| is there going to be any community process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| Again, as I understand it, and this is a fairly uncertain thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| they are coming back to us and saying, and approving specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| or saying, you may use this for X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| And as I understand it, we're not going to have a lot of leeway when it gets to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| We're in kind of uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| So that's the way I understand it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Also, most everything has to go through the state rather than come directly to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| So it's not like they're going to say, here's a pot of money, Knoxville, to use on roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| Here's a pot of money to use on energy improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| They're only going to do it for specific projects is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| But I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| Well, that's helpful because people are, you know, talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| we'd better get our requests all ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| These are projects that really aren't developed that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| And so those people should know that this is not going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| probably not going to happen to people who haven't developed their programs already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| I think that's probably pretty well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| The idea was to stimulate jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| So I think unless it's something that's ready to go, now there's different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| There's infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| There's energy-related projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| Is there education in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| There is some potential education money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7498)|
| 2:05:01| but that would obviously go straight through the school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| and wouldn't come through us in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| But, again, this is all pretty new territory that I'm yet to see anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| that can tell you exactly how it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| I guess just to voice one concern was that some of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| which are shovel-ready and may have been developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| and approved of a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7519)|
| 2:05:21| and have been kind of waiting in the line queue for the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| that perhaps these were, they might even be outdated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| or not necessarily relevant right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| And so will there be some publication of what these are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| Is this all just going to happen and nobody will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| No, it's all, I mean, from our standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| everything that's proposed is part of our ongoing capital improvement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| which gets approved through our annual budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| which is a very public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| We go through every spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| We're getting ready to start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| So they're all things that have already been approved by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| in the capital improvement project budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| So it's not, and anything we would turn in would be things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| we obviously still felt were needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| Right now, the preliminary things that were turned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| in terms of roads and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| just had one approved project in all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| It was a bridge somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| and I don't even know if it was in the city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| So right now, it doesn't look like there's this huge gravy train coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| Well, I guess that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7576)|
| 2:06:17| That was really my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| Obviously, as we learn more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| we'll do our best to share it with folks in terms of what comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7584)|
| 2:06:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Yeah, I guess I put my light on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| because I wanted to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| I spoke to Ms. Borges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| and knew she was going to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| I told her I'd speak to either you or Director Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| so you'd have a good answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| and I was going to apologize that I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| And I guess once it's on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| I can say that that was a completely off-the-cuff answer on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| So you really do know your stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Ms. Pila.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| I'm just wondering about that bridge project that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| because I know that we had a couple that had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| Steve, do you remember exactly where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| It's the Broadway viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| That ain't what I'm thinking about or hoping for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| So I'm just thinking about the TDOT projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7622)|
| 2:07:06| that had been approved and were scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| but then they had to be delayed and have to be rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| They won't be considered, will they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| in this kind of state if those funds happen to come to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| I think the project you're referring to is already funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| It's just in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| They're both already funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| They're already in the process waiting on letting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7650)|
| 2:07:34| So they're already funded within the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| It's a matter of letting the contract at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| not bidding the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Anything else to come before us tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090210?start=7666)|
