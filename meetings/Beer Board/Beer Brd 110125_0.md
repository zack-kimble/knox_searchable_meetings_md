| 0:10:40| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| I stopped by and talked to these folks because they have been on our list for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| They are waiting for their liquor permit from the state because of their proximity to the chapel at the funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| I talked to him, I guess it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| He said that they were waiting for that to get that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| So that's where that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| So we probably need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| So would you like to make a motion to postpone to February or March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Let's try February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Until February 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Is the motion to postpone until February 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=676)|

| 0:11:19| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| Mrs. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| I would hope that if these people are not ready in February that they will send someone to the beer board to explain these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=683)|
| 0:11:31| rather than our having to track them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I, too, stopped to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=693)|

| 0:14:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| There is a motion and second to defer it to March 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=845)|

| 0:14:12| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Yes, I've spoken to the owner and several of the parties involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and they are still struggling with the cost of trying to get the building to meet fire codes and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| and they're debating it back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| They really do need the time to see if they can work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=870)|

| 0:14:54| Anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| Can we move this to the end of the agenda, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Motion and second to move it to the heels of the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| Next, Tobacco Express, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| No one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| In my district, I have been by the smoke shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| It apparently is operational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| They had a sign advertising the sale of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| But from the letter we received from the attorney, it's my impression that perhaps the new owners are not the new owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| and the old owners are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| I tried to call the two people listed today, and I was not able to make a contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| Unless we know something down here, I'm not in favor of another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=946)|
| 0:15:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Councilman Palmer, how many times has this been postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| I've not kept up with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| This would be the third or fourth postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| I'm not sure either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Ms. Martin, do you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Sorry, this is the third that we're on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| And has the permit office had any conversation with the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| We're not getting any communication from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| But you've sent letters or phone calls or whatever, and we're not getting anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| We've communicated to home addresses, whatever we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| We've got some of the e-mails here in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| I wonder if, of course, we're acting on whether we just deny the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| but I wonder if our officer would stop by there and see if we're selling beer without a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| That's certainly something we ought to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| Either way, whether we postpone it or not, it's certainly not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I'll support either the denial or not considering this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| because neither applicant has been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And in my consideration of a permit, that is the number one criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| And all the time that this has been before us, evidently they've never come into the police department to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| That's another concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| I would move to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Certainly you can do that, or you can just do nothing and it dies that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| Do you prefer a motion to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Let's do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1061)|

| 0:18:23| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| That brings us back around to Serene of Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| Has anyone appeared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| I'll move that we postpone this and have further contact with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| Ms. Day, have we tried to ring them up beyond just sending them the notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| I was talking to that gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| I've got lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Serene of Thailand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Any communication from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I've been dealing with the attorney's office, but none with the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Or we know from the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| This may be, is this their first time on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| This is their first time on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| There just may be some confusion about what's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| It might be in the interim between now and the next meeting if they could be contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| and just remind them that they need to have a representative here for the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| I'm sure you've already told them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Ms. Martin, did you wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| No, I was just going to confirm that they received written notification, but we will do it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| and we'll try to be a little more precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| I do not think that more precision is required, but perhaps a reminder might do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1175)|
| 0:19:43| There is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Is there a second to defer until February 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| I can't be two and one, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| There is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Seeing none, all in favor of deferring until February 22nd, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| It is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Now we move to the request for extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| You all will recall that there is a provision of the code that says once the permit has been granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| they have 90 days within which to commence utilizing the permit, and if not, then they don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1223)|
| 0:20:32| And there are a number of folks who are on your agenda there who have had the permit approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| and have not yet begun utilization of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| And so absent an affirmative motion on your part to extend the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| then their permit will die at this point and they'll have to start the whole permit process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| So that's what this is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| And the first one for consideration is the Discount Tobacco Mart, 3120 East Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1259)|
| 0:21:08| Is anyone here from Discount Tobacco Mart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Ms. Martin, what do you know about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| The signature card did come back so that the letter was received, but we don't know anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1278)|
| 0:21:26| Have they had a previous deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| No, they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| This is the first time they've been deferred or first time they've been eligible for deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I would defer to the councilman from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Since this is their first deferral, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| I said that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Well, extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| I think I want to move that we just delay it to the next billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| February 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| There is a motion to extend to February 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| All in favor of deferring to February 22, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| It is extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Will they get additional notice on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| Jackson Avenue Market, 200 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Is there any further information we have about that other than what's in our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| They got the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| First time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| First time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| These are all first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| First three or this is the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| This is their first time, you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Well, I'm going to move that we defer it until the next billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| Motion to extend until February 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| All in favor of the extension, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| It is extended until February 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Just Ripe, 513 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1387)|
| 0:23:17| Please tell us your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Kristin Ferber, and the address is 513 Union Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Are you seeking an extension for getting the business in operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| Could you give us a little explanation, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Well, we're just still under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| We finished our drywall and trim in the last week or so, so we're getting very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Do you have a concept of how much time you think you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| I think our construction will be finished within three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| but I'm not sure how long it will take for our inspections to get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Sounds like she probably needs until March 22 would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| I move we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Motion to extend to March 22, and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| You are extended until March 22, so if you're not done within that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| you're going to need to come back at that time and ask for a further extension if that's what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And the next four have previously come to you for an extension and been granted, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| and now you need to consider whether you want to do it again or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| East Side Market, 2705 Martin Luther King Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| Is anyone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, this is in my district, and this is how many times have we delayed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1482)|
| 0:24:53| Isn't it twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| This would be the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| So this would be the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Well, if this is the third time and they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| and I think at that particular location there's some lottering going on around there anyway, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| So I think I'll just not make any motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| Absent a motion, it will not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Seeing none, it will not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| Next, Mandarin Palace, 3001 Knoxville Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1526)|
| 0:25:42| Yi Lin Liu, 3001 Mall Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| I'm Francis Della Rocha, 11167 Kingston Pike, Baragat, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Is the applicant seeking an extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Can you give us a brief explanation of why that would be necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| They were planning on opening in September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| but they ran into some mechanical issues with the ventilation inside the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| This is in the Simon Mall at the East Hall Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| and apparently they're having to run a lot of additional ventilation throughout the whole restaurant space into the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| So it's a big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| And then they're also having to put some additional firewall alongside that, so it's a fairly big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| Do we have a concept of the time frame when we anticipate that it will be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Yes, they're saying by March at the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Are you seeking an extension until the March meeting then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I'll also move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| There's a motion to extend to March 22 and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Mr. Della Rocha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| That was an old light, but, no, I know these folks have been working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| I talked to the mall manager the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| and he said because of this inner tie with the mall ventilation system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| it was much more complex than simply dealing with the one structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| So they ran into work they didn't foresee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| They need the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| All in favor of extending to March 22, please indicate by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| You are extended until March 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| If you're not able to go forward then, you'll need to come back on March 22 and seek further extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Rick's Place, 1525 Downtown West Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| They've requested withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| We can just go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Then nothing will accomplish their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| Seeing nothing, they will not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Santa Fe, 3920 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I can report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| It appears from my investigation that Farrell Auction was in the process of selling the kitchen equipment earlier in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1688)|
| 0:28:20| And this is the one that was in an estate, and it needed some extensive remodeling before the tenant can move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1700)|
| 0:28:28| And apparently the estate and the son who now owns it is not interested because they're selling off the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| So I think this one's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| I haven't heard back from that gentleman from Atlanta since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd110125?start=1714)|
