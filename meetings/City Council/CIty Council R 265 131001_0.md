| 0:01:36| We are all here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| Councilman Steyer, you already want to ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=98)|
| 0:01:42| He's not all here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Ready to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| Okay. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=108)|
| 0:01:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| I hope that my fellow colleagues do not start to call me the postponement person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| And I'm not real happy about having to postpone the following item if we so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| But we would like to postpone 9B for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| And I have asked that a Tenova representative come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| and explain better than I in terms of why they'd like to have the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Thank you, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| We appreciate your consideration of this request for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Melanie, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Melanie Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I'm with Tenova Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| I'm at 4818 Briar Rock Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| We are asking for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| The sellers of the property that is under consideration for rezoning have raised a concern with Tenova that bears our work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=172)|
| 0:03:04| which is what is the potential property tax implications that they will incur between the time of the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=184)|
| 0:03:13| and the time that the option is closed and we purchase the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| which, as you know, we have a Certificate of Need to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| We're very confident that we will get this worked out over the course of the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| but there are multiple sellers involved in different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| So just the time involved in that process is longer than we could get done before tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| Melanie, you might mention the fact of when this came to light so that my colleagues will understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| This just came up recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| It has come up recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| And we called you when we realized that we were not going to be able to get this done in time for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| We called you on Thursday of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| So we certainly are working very hard to have it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| I think we've had a good relationship with the sellers through the process, and we're committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| I think we'll get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| And also I just want to mention that we did let those folks that are opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| we let them know that this was a possibility for tonight so that we didn't have a large turnout one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| But I do think there --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| I just want to say there is a disappointment on the part of not only myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| but I'm sure my fellow colleagues in terms of the postponement for this for two more weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| in terms of all the information that we've been receiving both in terms of e-mails and telephone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| and meeting people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| But I do understand what's going on and do appreciate the fact that you do want to get this straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| So I will be making a motion to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| If you could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Ms. Robinson, if you could come back, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| So I'm hearing in two weeks we're going to read it regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=291)|
| 0:05:00| That is our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| I mean, we are every bit as disappointed as you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| And so we are working furiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| I don't know if you are or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| I don't know if you are or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| But, I mean, I want assurance tonight to support this that we're going to hear this in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| That is absolutely our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| Just a yes or no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| If I may say something beyond yes or no, if that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| My answer to that question is that we are trying to work with the sellers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| in the manner in which we have to approach this entire project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| which is that we want to maintain good communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| We want to maintain good transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| And we want to work with them in a way that maintains our credibility with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| And we believe we can get that done in the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| We want this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| We want this project to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| And I believe the sellers do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| I think we all have the same goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| It's the technicalities and the formalities of getting that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Well, I mean, if that were the case, then we'd be hearing it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| If there was an anxiousness on their part, then we'd be hearing it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| But what I want is an assurance that we're going to hear it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| I mean, this has gone on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| And you're coming here at the 11th hour and asking us, you know, to, you know, I'm ready to read it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| and get it over with, get this behind us and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| But you're saying what I'm hearing now is maybe in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| I'm not hearing we're going to read it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| We are committed to being ready to do this in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| I don't know what else to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| We have sellers that we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| And I believe we do all have the same goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| But we do have eight sellers who are in different geographic locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| We believe we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| And we would have asked for a longer postponement if we didn't think we could have it done in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Well, you knew you had all those sellers, you know, prior to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| And when this all started, you knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| So you're asking this council, you know, to bid you all a favor tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| but with no assurance that it's going to be read at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| I can give you my assurance that we will do everything humanly possible to be prepared next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=435)|
| 0:07:30| Are you finished, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| I actually made a formal motion, but I'd like to make a motion to postpone this for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| All in favor of the postponement say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=472)|

| 0:08:01| Actually, and I apologize, we also had somebody signed up to speak in favor of the postponement, Stephen Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=481)|
| 0:08:12| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| He said he'll waive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| You'll waive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=495)|

| 0:08:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Got a lot of names here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| So any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| We have 11A, a certificate of compliance renewal, and 11L through N are pensions, 12D through H are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=516)|
| 0:08:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| For the mayor's report, first I want to say that I just got back from visiting three of the many events held tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| for the National Neighborhood Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| I think I ran into basically just about every one of you, council members and Chief Rausch, in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=543)|
| 0:09:13| Because a lot of them started at five or six in our council meetings at seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| we all had to scrunch a lot in in a short time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| I was able to go to the Beck Cultural Exchange Center to see the Dandridge Avenue Neighborhood Watch Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| and three other groups that were there with them, and also out to Norwood and Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| It's a great annual event, and it's something that helps promote neighborhood safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| and it strengthens our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| So we're glad to see such active participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Do you remember how many groups we had, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| For tonight we had, let me try to recall, I think we had 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| That's the number I was thinking, about 60 different neighborhood organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| and neighborhood watches participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| So that was a lot to try and get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Maybe you all did better than me on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| And a gorgeous night compared to that cold winter night we had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| Right, great night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I also know that most of you were there at the Legacy Parks Luncheon on September 20th out at Seven Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| It's a beautiful day in a beautiful place, and Governor Haslam announced that Seven Islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| will soon become the first state park in Knox County and the first birding park in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| So that's great news for our city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| and will help us continue to build our identity as an outdoor recreation destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| The other thing that Vice Mayor Palos and I were particularly excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| was that the governor's other announcement that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| which is that the state was giving Legacy Parks a grant of $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| to build four miles of new biking and hiking trails in the urban wilderness in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| These trails will go on the 100 acres of land that the Wood family so generously donated in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| So what this means is that the state is now helping to build wilderness trails in the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| where not long ago there was discussion about building a big road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| So we're particularly excited about getting that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=665)|
| 0:11:10| So thank you to Vice Mayor Palos and to all of you who have supported us in that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Tomorrow, Vice Mayor Palos and I and other council members, I presume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| will be out at the Sam Duff Park, which is off Chapman Highway, kind of behind the crystals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| At 10 a.m., we're officially opening a new playground there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| which is something that the local community had asked for and has been waiting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| We talk a lot about the urban wilderness, but our local parks and playgrounds are just as important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| in promoting healthy living and outdoor recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| So we thank Joe Walsh and all of our Parks and Recreation staff for overseeing that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| I also want to mention Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I'm going to talk about our Firefighters Memorial Luncheon, which is next Tuesday, October 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| The ceremonies begin at 1130 a.m. Tuesday, October 8th at 1130| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| at the downtown fire department headquarters on Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| I certainly encourage everybody to come out for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| and pay tribute to those who have braved really great danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| and sometimes have paid very high personal costs to keep our city safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| So we look forward to that memorial every year so we don't forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| Also, just to remind you that our ongoing series of neighborhood meetings on traffic calming is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| Office of Neighborhoods, along with other, I think, engineering, other staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| are organizing these to give people a chance to express their views about traffic calming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| and their ideas about what's the best way to control speed in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| We finished two of the five planned meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| and in the next few weeks we have two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| In West Knoxville on Thursday, October 10th at 6 p.m. at the Arnstein Jewish Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=774)|
| 0:13:02| And then on Monday, October 14th in Councilman Palmer's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| we have Monday, October 14th at 6 p.m. at Northwest Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So we hope you'll come out if you're in those areas to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| what you think we ought to do about traffic calming in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| And finally, I want to invite you all to the Centennial Conservation Expo on Saturday, October 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| It's at Chilhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| It will start at 10 a.m. and go on until 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Free parking and free admission. It's a family affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| What we're doing is marking the 100th anniversary of the National Conservation Exposition of 1913,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| which was also held at Chilhowee Park 100 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| and was probably the largest event in Knoxville history until the World's Fair in 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| So we're celebrating our local history and the legacy of conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| as well as our ongoing commitment to conservation and sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Lots of our local and regional conservation agencies and groups will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| with displays and hands-on activities like the Oak Ridge National Lab, TVA, IM's Nature Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| and the National Park Service, if, in fact, they're back to work by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| Let's hope for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| There will be children's games and activities, live music, circus performers, free paddleboarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| I expect to see all of Council out there at the Chilhowee Park Lake, weather permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| And there will even be exhibition boxing matches at the Golden Gloves Arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| to provide some of that old fairground excitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| We will have the formal opening ceremonies at 11 a.m. with the great keynote speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=882)|
| 0:14:48| Lila Pinchot is the great-granddaughter of Gifford Pinchot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| who is a legendary conservationist who was the first head of the U.S. Forest Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| and also the chairman of the advisory board of the 1913 exposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| And Lila has another Knoxville connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| She just earned her doctorate in natural resources from UT here in Knoxville last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| So we're really excited that she's flying back into town to be part of the expo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| and give us that historical connection to the event 100 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I understand that we also may see an appearance by President Theodore Roosevelt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| so I encourage everyone to come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I really want to recognize Jesse Mayshark from our communications team sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| It was really his idea to do this, and he's put together a great team of city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| and lots of volunteers, a lot of organizations that really caught this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And if you walk the halls, I just noticed walking the hall down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| from the city-county building out here to the assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| there are, what do you call those things on the windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| They're like signs on the windows, like a static cling, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| sign on the windows pointing to each of the trees that you pass along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| and it explains what kind of a tree it is and what it does in terms of conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| how many gallons of rainwater it might soak up in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| and the positive impact on our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And I see it's got the Conservation Expo emblem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| as well as it's produced by our Urban Forestry Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| So I was really impressed, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| I didn't know that was down there until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| So thanks to all the folks who are doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| really trying to help us celebrate our history of conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| but also reinvigorate our current efforts to preserve our natural resources and assets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| So that was a long report, but there's lots of stuff going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and I hope to see you all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Oh, we also have another big announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Are you going to make it, or should I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| You make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Oh, well, we had a little girl Monday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| and mom and baby are happy and healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| This is not a postponement, Mayor, so everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| No, I want to recognize a group of people that, through a very cooperative effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| finished the road work and all the utility work on Lions View two months early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| two months ahead of schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| And this was due to the work of KUB and their contractor, Charles Blaylock & Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| and the subcontractor, Pipeline Construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| But all of this, this 3.83 miles of utility work over a 21-week period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| they actually worked six days a week from morning to dusk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| But it was also a joint effort that we have to also commend the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| because there was a lot of cooperation between city parks and recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| because of the Lions View Park area that was used as a staging area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| the city urban forestry, and city engineering for the paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| So I just want Council to be able to recognize all those involved in this effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| and realize once again that they were finished almost two months ahead of schedule on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1095)|

| 0:22:54| Jim, just tell us a little bit about this since it's been going on since 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and we're shooting for 2018 to finish the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| I guess there's phases that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1387)|
| 0:23:16| I wasn't here for the whole thing, so I don't know the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| but the original two segments were constructed entirely by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| So they did all of the management, all of the right-of-way purchases, all of the design, all of the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1408)|
| 0:23:37| It has gotten sort of put a little back in the line a couple of times in favor of other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1417)|
| 0:23:48| and that last segment that links the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Meanwhile, TDOT has changed their policy about doing non-state highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1433)|
| 0:24:02| I mean, we pretty much don't have any choice in this particular agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| They've made their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| They're not going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| So we're just modifying the existing agreement to recognize the fact that we've got to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| In the first amendment, we took over the administration of the work, I guess, that's done by contract, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Now we're going to administer or manage the utility work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Right, and the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| And the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| So previously, we hardly touched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| You just watched that $20 million be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| That is pretty much correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Now you've got the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Yeah, we have all the responsibilities associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1476)|

| 0:24:51| Most of the people who lived in the area thought it had been in the process their whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| So part of the work was completely done, and the transition to city responsibility occurred during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| I want to thank Jim Hagerman and Tom Clabo and others who have met with representatives of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1502)|

| 0:25:17| And the people in the area wanted it done yesterday, but they're satisfied that it will be done sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1517)|

| 0:25:29| Jim, has all the design work been done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Well, yes, but there was a complete design that was pretty much ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| but it's now something like five years old or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Actually, nearly all of the right-of-way has been purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| Was there any room for any bike lane or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| There is a greenway on one side of it in the original design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| The complicating factor here is that the state doesn't have to follow all of the regulations that the city has to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1559)|
| 0:26:09| so we do need to review the plans, review the design to make sure that we can do what we need to do in the footprint that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1569)|
| 0:26:20| Specifically, we've got to do more with stormwater than the state would have had to do if they had done it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| So there is going to be some redesign that's going to be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1598)|

| 0:26:43| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to request the public building authority of the county of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1604)|

| 0:26:55| at various city facilities for an amount not to exceed $188,670.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1624)|

| 0:27:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| 11I is a resolution authorizing the mayor to accept a 2013 Chevrolet Police Pursuit Tahoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| awarded to the Knoxville Police Department by the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| during the Governor's Highway Safety Projects Law Enforcement Challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Yes, Councilman Dela Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| I'm going to just brag on Lieutenant Ron Green, who I don't know what he won, but he got the Tahoe, so pretty cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Yeah, he had an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| What the program is is you submit what your efforts have been for the year in terms of traffic safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| and so we made our submission to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| And so what that does is makes you eligible to be drawn from one of the ten lucky participants to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| and then draw a key and try to start the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| And Ron was number nine on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| There were two keys left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| He happened to pick the right key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| So we won the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| It's fully loaded, has moving radar in it, has a wonderful light package, MDT cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| It's all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| So it will have the advertising on the side of it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| and then after that we'll stripe it for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| Pretty neat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Special commendation for Ron Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| He's going to Las Vegas anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| We can follow him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Maybe we can see what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Evans A. Lee Construction, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| of $476,118 for a multipurpose building at the Phil E. Keith Training Center located at Cement Plant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1729)|
| 0:28:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Yeah, I'll let the chief just fill us in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| because we have been beefing up that training center with the roundhouse and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| Just tell us about this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| What this building will do is allow us the opportunity to do a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| One is we'll be able to host more training for larger classes out at our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| It will also allow us to do some of our physical training that we do inside when the weather is poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| So we'll be able to do what's kind of called crossfit, but we'll be able to do that inside this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| as well as some of our defensive tactics training while we're out at our range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| So it will provide us, as it says, a multipurpose, a large space to be able to do multi things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| And after our full year of both training and sort of on-the-job supervision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| we still have periodic retraining for our guys, and we're keeping them fit and ready to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| We have annual in-service that we go out for additional training, and then that's one week every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| And then throughout the year we provide training opportunities for not only our officers, but for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1801)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| So we have a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Datatronic Control, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| in the amount of $42,600 to replace the LED electronic message center located at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1825)|
| 0:30:34| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| I'd like for Mr. Mackay to come up and explain to us exactly what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| and also the fact that this sign will follow the existing sign ordinance that we have in terms of its regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1848)|
| 0:30:57| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Greg Mackay, Director of Public Assembly Facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| What we're doing is removing the inside of the sign that's currently there and putting in new components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| What's in there now is obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| It can't be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| If you go by and look at it, the lights are blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| It's not functioning correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| We do have to follow the city ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| and I think that we're on a restriction to where we can only change the sign once every minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| and we will, of course, follow those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Mackay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| 12A is an ordinance approving the request of Flournoy Development Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| for an amendment to the Southwest County Sector Plan for mixed uses to high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| for property located on the north side of South North Shore Drive, west side of Thunderhead Road, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| And we have some people who've signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| It looks like so Arthur Seymour, Jr., Jeremy Brewer, and Kathleen Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| Are those all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| All three or four to speak for the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Okay, and then followed by these are the three that have signed up against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Deborah Stevens, Frank Slagle, and Kara Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| So that's the order we will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| And by our rules, you can have up to three people speaking up to five minutes each for either of the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| So we'll start with Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| And everyone, if you'd please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| And I keep the time, and I'll give you a little warning when you've got a certain amount of time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Hopefully at a minute I'll try and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Go ahead, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1970)|

| 0:33:08| This three-part request is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| ultimately resulting in 24 units per acre for a parcel of land at the North Shore Town Center at the far end of West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=1993)|
| 0:33:26| Flournoy Development, our client from Columbus, Georgia, which has done business in Knoxville before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2006)|
| 0:33:35| desires to construct 248 apartments on 10 acres of property at the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2015)|
| 0:33:45| To do this, it needs an amendment to the sector plan, an amendment to the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| and zoning of RP2 with up to 25 units per acre permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| As part of the North Shore Town Center, which was contemplated and started development in the early part of this century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| the town center concept contemplates mixed use, commercial, office, and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2050)|
| 0:34:21| Since the original development of the plan for the center, there have been three significant developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2061)|
| 0:34:29| The most important one has been a crash and a depression in the real estate business nationwide and here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2069)|
| 0:34:40| A rather large tract of the property has been acquired by Knox County Board of Education and is now an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2080)|
| 0:34:52| That tract was designed for multifamily residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| And the target and public sites have been rezoned to allow big box retailers in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2096)|
| 0:35:05| The 10 acres Flournoy plans to build on were planned originally, or at least the original development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2105)|
| 0:35:15| for townhouses with up to 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| We are asking for an additional 88 units, for 248 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| The town center zone contemplates a high number of residences adjacent to commercial and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| In spite of the real estate crash, there has been quite a bit of development in the area in the past two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| At least Publix and Target are there, and there are several other commercial developments in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| There are two office buildings under construction, one other contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| What is missing to make this a true town center development is the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I think there are approximately 30 homes that have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| But the town center concept contemplates a high density of population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2165)|
| 0:36:14| There is no other residential other than the homes at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| One of the major issues that has been discussed by email and in person and otherwise with Flournoy Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2180)|
| 0:36:29| and with you all are the design guidelines for the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| The original plan submitted by Flournoy did not comply with those design guidelines and have been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| After meetings with MPC staff, Flournoy and its architect understand what is required by the design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| and is prepared to comply with those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| So here we are at a sort of a crossroads with the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| We have an opportunity to provide the residential component of the mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2227)|
| 0:37:15| Or we can, if this petition is denied, that residential component will continue to grow very slowly via single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2235)|
| 0:37:27| So we are asking that you all approve this zoning so that we can add the residential component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2247)|
| 0:37:37| that the North Shore Town Center originally contemplated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| It needs people and Flournoy's development, which would have to be reviewed by the MPC under the use on review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| and can be appealed back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| We'll comply with the, we'll be compliant with the residential guidelines for the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Jeremy Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Please state your name and address and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| May it please the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| May it please the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| My name is Jeremy Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| I'm the General Counsel with Flournoy Development Company in Columbus, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| My address is 900 Brookstone Center Parkway, Columbus, Georgia, 31904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| I asked Mr. Seymour if I could speak tonight to tell you all about the Flournoy companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| We are three companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| We have a Flournoy Development Company, which develops our properties and develops our apartment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| We have Flournoy Construction Company, which works very closely with development in building the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| And we have Flournoy Properties, which leases and manages on a day-to-day basis our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| We were founded by John Flournoy in 1967, so we've been in business for 45 years roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| We've built over 30,000 apartment units over that time in roughly 150 apartment communities all over the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2342)|
| 0:39:12| and as far west as Texas and Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| During that time, we are very proud to say that we have finished every construction project we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| We have an unblemished credit history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| And John Flournoy, our founder, will tell you that that was not always easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| We've run into problems, but we've always stuck with our projects, and we've always seen them to successful completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| As Mr. Seymour mentioned and as I hope you all know, we recently did complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| and successfully own and manage an apartment community here in Knoxville, the Amberley Bluff Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2385)|
| 0:39:53| They are on Kingston Pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| We still own and manage those, and the same two Flournoy development project managers that developed that apartment community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2396)|
| 0:40:05| are also working on the apartment community we're here to talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| We've got financing in place for the project that we're here to talk about tonight through Oppenheimer Financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2410)|
| 0:40:21| Our architect on this project, Mr. James Wesseldyke, has worked with us on several thousand apartment units over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2421)|
| 0:40:30| He's one of the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Our civil engineer, Brad Salisbury, we've worked on the Amberley Bluff Apartments here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| We've got a great team in place to work on this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| As I mentioned, we've done apartment communities all over the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| We're very comfortable in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We are very comfortable in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| We're very enthusiastic about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| We think it will be a great addition to the community, just as we're confident that the neighbors in Cheryl Hill will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2458)|
| 0:41:07| that the Amberley Bluff Apartments were a great contribution to that part of the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| We intend and always have, since we are going to develop and own and continue to own and manage these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| we want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| We do want to work with our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| We're willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| We are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| We plan on being the owners of this property for a long time, and so we want to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| We want to get along with the homeowners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| We want to get along with the business owners in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| And I assure you we are willing to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Unless you have any questions, I will yield the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And now we have Kathleen Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| Branstetter, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I keep wanting to say brain, not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| There's a famous lawyer in Nashville, Cecil Branstetter, but she's not related, but she pronounces and spells her name the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| My first name is Catherine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| We got it wrong twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| It happens often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| So I'm Catherine Branstetter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| My address is 2099 Thunderhead Road, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| I am the founder and the owner of Neighborhood Bar, which is a boutique fitness studio at the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| I am here tonight to express my support for the proposed apartment project at the North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| and I want to thank all of you for allowing me to speak and present my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Two years ago, I quit my job as an accountant at Vulcan Materials Company in Birmingham, Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| I packed up all of my things, and I left my friends and my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| and moved to a town where I knew no one to start my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| I had a lot of faith in the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| When researching for places to put my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I was sold on the idea that the North Shore Town Center could be as dynamic of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| as some of those sidewalk districts that you would come across in Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| In fact, I believed in the North Shore Town Center so much that if I had not gotten my space at the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I would not have come to Knoxville to start my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| I would have found another city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| It has been my observation since opening in October of 2011 that the North Shore Town Center is anything but dynamic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2618)|
| 0:43:48| anything but a destination center, and just the site of a colossal failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| Town centers and sidewalk districts, when executed properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| could take Knoxville to the next level, making it a more progressive city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| The largest destination shopping area in the city of Birmingham experienced a similar struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| to what we're experiencing with the North Shore Town Center during its first few years of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and it actually wasn't a large success until an upscale apartment complex was added as a part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2656)|
| 0:44:25| It began to thrive and reach its full potential as more merchants moved to the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| because there were more people at that town center to support those merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| Were there traffic concerns? I'm sure that there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| The main entrance and exit to that apartment complex is located in the middle of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| I'm sure there were also safety concerns, property value concerns, crime concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| because the complex is located amongst residential neighborhoods and amongst a very busy school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| But the bottom line is that the commercial portion of that development would never have flourished as quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| without the addition of a high-density upscale rental housing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| What we are missing at the North Shore Town Center is people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| We need people to shop in our stores, walk on our sidewalks, and sit on our patios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| We need people to have confidence in the area commercially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| and we need the residents of Knoxville to be excited to visit and excited to live in the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| I'd like to invite everybody on this council to come visit the North Shore Town Center and come see our businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| come see what we can do to add value and to add revenue to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| We're a very unique, eclectic center, and we have a lot to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| Just the addition of the proposed apartments could generate hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| in both property tax and sales tax revenue from the additional shopping that could take place in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| Knoxville is now my home. I love it here, and I love the vibe of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| and I know that this council will recognize the value of this project and make the right decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Okay, now I will hear from the three people who are opposed to the ordinance amendment or the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| So the first is Judge Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| I'm here as private citizen Debbie Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I live at 9551 Clingmans Dome Drive, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| I've been asked by the residents of North Shore Town Center to speak on their behalf in opposition to this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| My family and I intentionally moved to North Shore Town Center in 2005, as did many of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| We believed in the town center concept, and we still believe in the town center concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| Town center is just not a fancy word for subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| In the world of urban planning, it envisions vibrant live, shop, work and play community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| that focuses on a consistent design guidelines, energetic spaces that focus on green spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| and walkability and density that is part of an overall plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| Many years ago, the city of Knoxville spent a lot of time and effort in creating a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| and extremely detailed zoning for town center, now known as TC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2850)|
| 0:47:37| When my neighbors and I bought into this community, we did so with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| that we were protected by the zoning and the development guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Now we have a developer who wants to come into our community and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| we want to be part of your community, but your zoning and your guidelines will not fit our model for profitability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| so we want to remove the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| On July 8th, they presented their plans to MPC, and those apartment renderings that they provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| made no effort to comply with guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| The site plan appeared as a sea of asphalt of at least 400 parking spaces with three to four story buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| scattered along the perimeter and no appearance of a walkable community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| that would be an integral component of our town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| In addition, they proposed a substantial increase in units per acre by almost 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| increasing from 16 units to 25.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| When I met with the representatives of Florany, I shared our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| They indicated they were willing to work on the exterior look of the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| but would make no promises with regard to the overall design component of a town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| and certainly would make no concessions with regard to density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| I indicated there was nothing about their proposal that was consistent with the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| and I was confident the neighborhood would oppose in its current configuration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| but we continued to remain open to discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| Since that time, the only change was receipt of a drawing of one side of one elevation of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| two days before this hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| There has been no effort to make this development an integrated part of a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| and the density remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| And just for your information, the Amberley Bluff Apartments that we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| is at eight and a half units per acre compared to the 25.5 they're suggesting for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| Our town center community is beginning to turn the corner as a successful development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| after the financial difficulties of the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| North Shore market investors who owns the majority of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| recently sold the Publix and the adjoining retail shops for nearly $17 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| and they're about to begin development around the lake that is going to be the heart of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| They and we are excited that that lake will be an enticing part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| Demographics from the North Shore Town Center website indicate there are 70,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| who live within a five-mile radius and 270,000 within a 10-mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| One of the current restaurant owners has taken an option on another building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| within the town center for another restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| I get my hair cut at the Blue Grotto Salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| It takes me two to three weeks to get an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| Uncle Mattio's Pizza, which opened recently, had traffic on Friday evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| that filled the parking lot and had people outside the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| There are ten new homes under construction in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| and they all have sold signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Now that we are seeing the excitement in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| and the overall tax base it can bring to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| it is not time to waver and allow someone who doesn't get the concept of a town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| to remove the zoning that protects our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Flournoy is a successful developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| They build nice apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| They have a business model that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| It is just not the right project for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| Let me make it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We are not opposed to apartments, townhouses, or brownstones on the tract of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| The current zoning permits 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| The original plans showed such a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| We oppose any effort to shoehorn 25 units per apartment, 25 apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| onto a site that is designed for 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| We ask that you protect our town center community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| protect the investment the city has made in town center zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| deny any request to rezone or amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| to accommodate this proposal for 245 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| Mr. Slagle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| My name is Frank Slagle, and my address is 1924 White Aram Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| My wife and I own one of the houses that is adjacent to the North Shore Town Center property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| that Flournoy is asking to be rezoned to allow high-density residential apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| Although our house is not in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| the city limit line runs across my back property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| We do own a business, and the building it occupies is in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| We are city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| We are property-qualified voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And as I understand it, we have legal standing if the need arises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| because of the proximity of our property to the property being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| We have lived in our house for more than 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| and have seen this property change drastically over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| We are not against development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| We didn't resist when the town center concept was first introduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| We understand why it needed to be adjusted to allow target publics in the new elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| However, we can't agree with this small 10-acre plot in North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| being rezoned to allow 248 apartments and 440 parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| and we don't believe it would provide a reasonable transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| between the commercial part of North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| and the single-family residence of North Shore Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| The site plan, as you have seen, calls for a vast expanse of asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| punctuated with the eight tallest buildings in a five-mile radius of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| Mr. Seymour has told you that they revised their plans to address our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Our primary concern now, as it has always been, is the density of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| I talked to Ryan Foster at Flournoy and Mr. Seymour both on September 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| and they both assured me they could not and would not consider adjusting the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| and, therefore, address our main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Flournoy and Mr. Seymour have been unyielding on the density issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| and have feigned cooperation on issues that aren't nearly as important to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| Flat tops and facades aren't the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| We do have petitions with over 1,200 signatures opposing this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| We have over a dozen neighborhoods in opposition to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| The PTA of the town center school is opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| This property can be developed within the guidelines that are already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Flournoy does not need to have the property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| if they are really interested in adhering to the town center guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Those guidelines allow apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| and I have told Mr. Seymour if they will create an apartment development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| that will adhere to the current guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| I will bring the shovel and the champagne to the groundbreaking ceremony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| We have lived through tough times with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3267)|
| 0:54:34| We remember the night the brush piles spontaneously combusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| and put all our homes in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| We lived through the vacant brownfields of the Great Recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| and all the rodents and snakes that came with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| We are starting to see this development blossom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| and what could be a model for other parts of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| Businesses are moving in right and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| The new Uncle Matty-O's Pizza Joint is their fastest-growing store in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| They have good food, fair prices, and live music on the patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| Come to the patio at Matty-O's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| All of this is just a precursor of what will be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| when the property around the lake is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| And we'll all be able to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| and enjoy the town center we were sold on and agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| We have finally found our stride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Please don't deter this momentum by rezoning this property again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3342)|

| 0:55:58| Kara Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| My name is Kara Smith, resident at 9519 Clingmans Dome Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3366)|
| 0:56:12| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| My husband and I are proud parents of a current student and future student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| at the North Shore Elementary School and homeowners in the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| Tonight, I will speak from the perspective of a concerned mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| an active school parent, and PTA member, as well as a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| I am not in favor of the removal of the TC1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| I am against stripping the guidelines that protect the nature of this development in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| A protection we all depended on when we made our purchase here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| As the very first homeowner at the North Shore Town Center, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| we made a large financial commitment on the purchase of our new home seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3421)|
| 0:57:09| Our purchase was based on a concept of living in a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| with a consistent architectural look with safe sidewalks throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| giving residents the convenience to walk from their home to parks to shopping and dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| We signed the bank and title work, and that evening, we found out we were to become parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| What a thrill, and a little scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| We, as many did, struggled through some very challenging financial years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| surviving the financial slump many experienced earlier in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| But our love and our belief in our community concept gave us hope to cling to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| Our investment would one day prove to have been a wise one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| Some sleepless nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Fast forward a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| The new elementary school is coming to the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| and our oldest son is to be a first grader in the inaugural class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| My little boy and I have quickly come to love our peaceful and picturesque walks to school each morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| These are memories that he and I will treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| But here we are today with two young boys facing a potential change to the zoning restrictions in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| and I will tell you, it frightens me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| I am concerned by the impact that such a large apartment dwelling will have on our property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| The large scale apartment with such close proximity to the neighborhood and school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| could quickly run off future single family home buyers, future taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3523)|
| 0:58:51| I am concerned by the immediate impact the increased density of this large apartment housing will have on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| They estimate this place will get an extra 2,800 car trips a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| onto the very street that my child and other students use and will use to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3546)|
| 0:59:13| The North Shore Town Center is the eastern boundary of the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| that extends all the way out to the Loudoun County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| More than 900 children attend this school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| so there's now this huge influx of traffic in the area as a result of adding such a dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| And there's no solutions for improving the traffic challenges on North Shore that will come as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| Can we handle that additional traffic? I'm afraid we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Let's be honest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| The increased density of these suburban planned apartments will change the stable residential nature of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| in a way that seems inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| The close proximity to the elementary school does concern me greatly as a mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| The property is positioned within the school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| I'm troubled that Florny has been unreceptive to the requests made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| They've been unwilling to simply listen to the vision that the homeowners have and the developers have always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| We reside in a quiet neighborhood where my son and I walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| The lifestyle we signed up for is being ignored by Florny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Our family has spent many dollars dining at local restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| and enjoying the products and services available in the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| and we do appreciate these local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| However, with that said, we do expect some support in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| These businesses are surrounded by neighborhoods full of residents who make great customers up and down North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| affluent neighbors ready to shop and to dine out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| However, it's unfair for these businesses to make us shoulder the burden of foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| at our expense of our home values and our lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| The proposed change in zoning has a direct impact on the school population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| on my children and other children's safety, the value of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| and the appeal to future homeowners to build and choose our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| Ma'am, I'm sorry, but your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Fair enough. Vote no. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Council, thank you all for being here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| And, Council, that concludes our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| Do they have time for a rebuttal or what's the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Rebuttal is really only on appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| I just looked it up to make sure that was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Okay. So both of us questioned that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| Okay. If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Go right ahead, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| I can assure, like my colleagues, that we have a lot of frustration over this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| And I know the neighborhood has a lot of frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| Part of our frustration has to do with it's difficult for us to receive information on a Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| before a Tuesday council meeting and then also receive information on a Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| that has to do with this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I do think that the developer is trying to do a project that possibly does fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3722)|
| 1:02:11| They've made a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| However, I'm not sure what those changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| I've seen one drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| I don't know if that affects all the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| They say it does, but I'm not sure what one drawing does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| The other concern, and I have met with them personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| the other concern that I have expressed to them is the siting of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| And I'm still concerned about the large retaining walls that appear to be on the west side of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| I understand now there are some retaining walls on the north side next to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| The drawing that I've received doesn't address the retaining walls in terms of the heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| And so I have a real concern about the siting of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| I have a real concern over the fact that we have a TC1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| and we have a TC1 guidelines that was put into effect some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| I do think that we're seeing a turnaround in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| I think that we have an opportunity here for a unique area that we need to stay with, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| in terms of what was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| The site plan, I want to go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| There's a lot of buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| There's a lot of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| I'm not sure about the green space, and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| But I think more what I'm concerned about is one of the things this council has worked on over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| is to make sure that the developers in the neighborhood get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| and that they speak to one another and share ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| This has not happened with this particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| There have been some meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| but it's difficult, council, for a representative of a neighborhood to receive information on a Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| and expect the neighborhood to get together over the weekend to discuss what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| The bottom line to this, what I see, is that we're talking the difference of 88 units on this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3833)|
| 1:04:02| And so the real question is, can we not make this project go with 160 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| which is what is allowed under the TC1, and also keep the guidelines that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| This also goes back to what I was referring to the other evening when we had a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| that we as a city, the city council, a lot of people, MPC, the administrative staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3857)|
| 1:04:25| work very hard at setting up guidelines and setting up requirements for areas in which we want to see developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3865)|
| 1:04:34| And we've had a tendency in the past that when a developer arrives, if they want to change those guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| or if they want to change what we've set up, we say, okay, we'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| Well, I think it's time to quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| I think it's time to set that if we've gone to all the trouble to set up guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| And if we've made those guidelines available, and everyone knows what it is, we've got ten acres of land here that's already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| We have a set of guidelines that are good guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| We have individuals who have relied on those guidelines and have invested, not only businesses that have invested in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| but we have a lot of homeowners that have invested in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| And I think it's our responsibility to see to it that we abide by those guidelines and that we abide by what was set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| Now, I do know that I have talked with a couple of the neighbors, and they said that, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| they might be willing to, you know, instead of 160, maybe 170 units, but definitely not to jump up to 248 units for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3924)|
| 1:05:34| So I'm really recommending that we need to stick with our guidelines, we need to stick with the zoning that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| and we need to leave the zoning the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| This property will be developed, I do believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| I talked to some of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| I know some of them are very much concerned about their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| I've also talked to some of the developers who have said what kind of businesses are coming into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| And I think the other thing that we need to look at as far as the businesses go is, I think, one of the individuals pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| it's not just the 30 or so families that live at the top of the hill that support these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| It's all the people within a one-mile radius and a ten-mile radius that affect those businesses also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| And so I would hate to think that right now, with the way the economy is changing, the way things are changing all over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| that we all of a sudden jump off and say, well, we have someone here who's going to put 248 units on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| when we ought to hold on to what it is that we've set up and what we've decided some time ago what the guidelines should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| and what the zoning should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| So my feeling is I feel very strongly that we should keep the TC1 zoning the way it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| and keep the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4003)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Councilman Dellivotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| First, a simple technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Someone passed a very large petition around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| Are you making that part of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I think that should be done so that it's part of the technical record and we give it to Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4019)|
| 1:07:06| It was passed around to Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Is it your intention to make that part of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| And then I guess my question goes to the Florida folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Obviously, you have a project here and you put some effort into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| I'm a little confused why there hasn't been more direct engagement with the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| I mean, there may be some things that they suggest that you could accommodate or adjust your plans to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| and I suppose maybe you view that as somewhat a hostile environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| But we found on this council that when neighbors and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| and people who are looking to develop things get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| that generally some positive results come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| Partly there's the fear of the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Partly there are things that affect that property that you may not be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| And certainly these neighbors could be ambassadors to finding tenants for your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| if they're happy with the development as opposed to, you know, sort of bad-mouthing you for abusing their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| So I really am a little surprised that there hasn't been this meeting that's been called for since June or July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| and has not taken place in any formal sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| I really think that should be the predicate to any request here for the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| and I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| The other is I wonder if, in looking at your design, I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| but, I mean, in you looking at your design, I heard a whole lot about the expanse of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4115)|
| 1:08:44| asphalt parking lots in an area that was supposed to be somewhat of a green space and walkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| I mean, have you considered things like parking under the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| and other activities that may or may not change the, you know, the outlook of how much you use your space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| and how you use your space and how it integrates into this town center design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| So it's a lot of unanswered questions, and I certainly concur with what Mr. Greaves said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| that there ought to be good reasons to vary from the guidelines, and maybe there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| I understand Mr. Donaldson has said that density is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and the business lady has said density is important to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| but also quality of development and sticking to the heart of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| Obviously, there can be adjustments to plans, but sticking to the heart of it is a pretty important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| So I'm concerned at this point that we would act on this zoning application without the engagement of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4175)|
| 1:09:43| as well as more sensitivity to what's trying to be achieved out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4183)|
| 1:09:48| And I understand that you all are proposing a very large and expensive project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| and that may be good for the city in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| but I don't know what we achieve if we set up standards and then just blow them away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| when it's sort of convenient to drop off a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So I'd like to see a lot more attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| and I suppose someone will say that you do that at the use on review stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| but we will be halfway down the pike at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| and I'd rather see some front-end attention to this before we hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| So that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Unless one of the council members call on you, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| We started off with a question for Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Well, if you have a question you want answered, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| If you want to address that in a minute or so, just tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| I mean, this question of getting together with the residents has been, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4236)|
| 1:10:42| reasonably demonstrated to be important to this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| and we certainly encourage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| and we don't think it's happened at the level that it should have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| And I'm not going to argue or try to rebut that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| The problem we have had is getting a handle on the design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4256)|
| 1:11:00| for the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| We've had several meetings with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| Now that our architect and engineers have a better understanding of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| we'd be happy to meet with anyone who wants to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| We have not had anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| We really don't have anything to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| We've been holding that for use on review, but we can within a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4285)|
| 1:11:32| It's less of show and tell than it is of meeting people on their own ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| We'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Finding out what their interests are and why they want to see changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| You've heard some of them here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| We've all seen hundreds of e-mails, but obviously a dialogue has not occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| I'm not going to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Well, I mean, conceptually, I'm interested in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| It's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| But it got waylaid when we started a whole new design concept three or four days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| And I asked, you know, we should have postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| You could have vetted that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| Maybe there was a way to work it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| But I regret that there haven't been the meetings we've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| I mean, you sat in my office a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| I said there's three things that I have concern about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| One was the design, and you fixed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| Two was the transition back and up to those eight or ten homes in North Shore Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| and I've seen nothing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| And three was to meet with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| the people that live in North Shore Town Center up on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| I think those people have a real stake in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| But I guess one question I had to Mark Donaldson is that it is approved for 16 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| Is there open for council or can an applicant apply for the TC1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4367)|
| 1:12:58| but just increase the number of units per acre as we do in other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| I mean, he's asking for tonight is for us to discard the TC1 zoning and abolish that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| and yet he'll adhere to some of the standards, but he also wants a higher density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Is there a way to keep the TC1 standard and increase the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| Mark Donaldson with NBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| There are several ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| There is a provision in the TC1 zoning that within an area defined as the peripheral boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| peripheral area, the overall density is not to exceed 16 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| This particular piece of property has been determined to be in the peripheral area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| of the overall town center scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| So it does, in fact, have a cap at the 16 units per acre level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| And it has an approved development plan for 160 units on approximately 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4442)|
| 1:14:11| They, in fact, with the previous approval, have maxed out the density that is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| partly because this particular site is a part of a property that was added into the overall town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4459)|
| 1:14:28| but not added into the overall town center zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| It's its own free-standing zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| So whereas in the balance of the property, you know, approximately 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| you can literally move density around, they don't have that option on this smaller tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| So they are locked into that point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| But can you do greater density in an RP zone district and still adhere to the town center guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4493)|
| 1:15:01| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| You could condition the zoning with that sort of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| We have been trying to convey to the applicants that that's what we're expecting at the staff level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4508)|
| 1:15:15| when it comes to the development plan approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| And we have seen some movement just within the last week in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| Is 25 units per acre, is that out of the ordinary for development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| Is that a high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| If you think about the town center district as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| I don't know the exact numbers of units that are approvable within that district, but it's a great number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| So this is a relatively small percentage of that overall allowed number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| And we've been working in various heart of Knoxville neighborhoods to kind of reverse code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| and create a new zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| When we look at individual small-scale apartment projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| they come in at 40 and 50 and 60 units to the acre, but you have to consider the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| So a 25-unit-to-the-acre project within a 100-acre town center development is not a great deal of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4574)|
| 1:16:26| But that's really the way we're looking at it, looking at it overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| You mentioned Publix, you mentioned Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| I mean, it's that whole entire site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| How many acres is that whole entire site, including the houses, approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| What was the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| On the order of 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| So you're looking at, in the concept, this particular property got, because it got pulled in at the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4599)|
| 1:16:48| it's a freestanding TC1 zone, and it's really, technically we're not looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| But, I mean, really it's part of the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| It has to be a part of the whole thing, not, you can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| Anyway, so, I mean, I think had there been more dialogue, you know, this is something that could have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| I'd like to have seen it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| But, unfortunately, when you're asked to vote with a limited amount of information, it makes it kind of difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| I just had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| I guess I'll ask Mr. Seymour or either the representative for these upscale apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| what kind of rental price are you talking about, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| Come up and identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Blake Breiman with Florida North Development, 900 Brookstone Center Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Rental rates will range from $750 up to probably around $1350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| I was on Clingman's Dome Drive and drove through that area to look at the site of where the apartments would be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4669)|
| 1:17:59| And I wanted to ask, I guess, Mr. Hageman, we've mentioned, a couple of people have mentioned about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Have we done any official traffic study down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| My understanding is that over the course of the development of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| there have been a couple of traffic studies done for this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| And Mark might be able to give some better information on this than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4701)|
| 1:18:30| but usually the traffic studies for a big change like this would come at the use on review stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4710)|
| 1:18:39| So there has not been a traffic study done for this particular proposal because it isn't that far along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4719)|
| 1:18:48| Making a left back on to North Shore could be a little dicey down there, that is for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| Well, those are a couple of questions that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Did you have more to add, Mr. Hageman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| I might note there have been a lot of changes made in order to handle that development on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| There's two lights and some widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| So there have been some changes to adapt to the amount of traffic that has been generated in general by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4753)|
| 1:19:23| So it's hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| I mean, everything hasn't really settled down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| So and as I said, it hasn't been analyzed for this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4769)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Right now, I am not prepared to vote favorably on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| but I obviously couldn't help but think as we went around and listened to my colleagues talk, is it worth postponing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| Is there going to be a conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| That hasn't occurred yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| And that's been my main difficulty with this whole thing because Mr. Seymour certainly knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| just like Councilman Della Vopi indicated, of our desire for neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| or surrounding areas and development proposals to meet somewhere in the middle and talk things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| And often, and I know personally, of developments that have come a lot better as a result of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| So I'm kind of scratching my head thinking, is this worth kicking down the road three meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| or two meetings or something to allow the parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| I'd have to ask the parties that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| My clients are saying yes or nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| Well, I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| I can make a motion to postpone and let's see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| So I will make that motion to postpone for, what, three meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| That would be, what, six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| What about the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Are you going to ask them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Does anyone want to speak to that motion to postpone for six weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4872)|
| 1:21:17| Councilman Grave, would you like to speak to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| I want to speak in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Well, you can speak for or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I had a conversation with Mr. Seymour this afternoon, which was that if the parties, being the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| if they were concerned only about the design guidelines, that this could be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| Please pull your microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| They have made an attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Do I need to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| They've made an attempt to reach the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| But also what Mr. Seymour told me was that if the question was density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| and if it was the fact that they would not accept or if the neighborhood will not accept 248 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4916)|
| 1:22:05| then they might as well pack their bags and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| And so the real question is if density is the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| and if the developer cannot make the project go with 160 units, which is what's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4932)|
| 1:22:19| then whether we postpone it six weeks or not is not going to be going to waste everybody's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| and it's not going to do any good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| So I think that's the real question is that the guidelines, yes, can be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| but the density seems to be the real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| I also want to emphasize that, again, as far as the site plan goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| I don't want to see out there what I see at the corner of Dean Hill and Morrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4960)|
| 1:22:46| which is the great pyramid of walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| And when I look at this plan and realize that between the apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| and the neighborhood there's a 12-foot high wall and all the asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| and I'm not sure what the height of the wall is, the new wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| between the apartment complex and the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| because there's no elevations on the drawing I've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| that we all need to remember that this is an introduction into that whole neighborhood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| And to take a site that has contours and curves and different elevations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| and try to put a flat unit complex on there is, first of all, it's not going to look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| And secondly, I think it's a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| But I think the real issue is if the neighborhood is saying that, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| they don't want to increase the density beyond 160,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| I don't know that it's worth waiting six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| And I think that's something we can ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| If that is the issue, I will withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5024)|
| 1:23:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| We've heard a lot of conversation tonight about density, about 160 units, about 248 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5039)|
| 1:24:06| and about the fact that the town center concept works when there is density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| It could be or I don't really think having looked at town centers fail throughout the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| because they didn't have the density that they needed to support the businesses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5058)|
| 1:24:23| I really think that we need to wait the three meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| and give an opportunity to see what can be done as far as density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| and as far as the appearance of this concept and working with the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I do know, from having talked to Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| that it's taken a few weeks for the town center concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| and Flournoy folks to all get aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| And as I understand it now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| they do have a better understanding of what's involved with the town center concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| I also think that if we say, well, 160 is it, that's the end of the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| then we're going to have this 10 acres of land sitting there vacant for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| And I think that that's probably not a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| And I really would appreciate if everybody in the audience was polite to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| We'll ask the audience to please act respectfully to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5116)|
| 1:25:24| Councilman Dellivopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Yeah, I guess Finbar had asked the developers, if they were interested in talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| maybe the spokespersons that were for the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| if they would, Ms. Stevens or someone else, if you would step up and just address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| I know there's a certain amount of frustration from being ignored for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| but we're here now, and the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| is there something productive that can be done so that the community has sort of its say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| and see if there's any move, give, or compromise in your all's viewpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Well, we have worked with many developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| We've worked with Bud Cullen and Jim Harrison on the Publix and the Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| We've worked with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| In fact, the school configuration was completely flipped as a result of Mike Stevens' suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| at a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| So you are correct in my frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| I advised the Florine folks in their meeting with the MPC in July of the 60 pages of design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5177)|
| 1:26:26| that were of record and said, this is what you need to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| And they apparently now have just figured out what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| I'm certainly, I think on behalf of all the neighbors, we'd be willing to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| but not at 240 units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I wasn't challenging the substance, but do you think there's something productive that could be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Or are we wasting time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Well, so far, the only discussion I've ever had with Florine is they're unwilling to discuss density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| We've always been willing to discuss density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| I think there should be further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| You've got a developer here that wants to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| And you've got to, you can work it out if you give time, if people are willing to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| I'm definitely in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I was in support of that on Monday morning to try to work, you know, give them time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| And it's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| I support the motion and, you know, give them six weeks and see if we can't work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| Actually, the motion's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I would like, I think there was a question about whether the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| You've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| I have been informed the motion is still on the table because the second was not removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| You were going to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Yeah, Councilman Grieve, I was going to ask the developer, or to Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| did you want to speak to whether density was on the table for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I think that was kind of the question that was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Jeremy Brewer with Flournoy Development Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| It sounds to me like there's concern from the council that there's just not enough information at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5279)|
| 1:28:07| and that plans came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| And I think those concerns are valid, and I think we can work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| I personally don't think six weeks is even necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| I think we can get together with the neighbors and with city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| and whoever else needs to be there and get something, try to do our best to work with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| We've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| We've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| I think we can give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| And so I would very much appreciate the opportunity, and I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| I know we can get you more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| We can address the retaining walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We can address the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| We can show you, hopefully, what every one of them is going to look like by that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| and also address the neighbors' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| So I guess the question asked was, was density on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| That's the question on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| I suppose it's on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| I don't know what we can agree to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| My understanding is that we could do 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| So, you know, if that works, I guess there would be no reason to come back in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| But we can talk to them about it, and I can't commit to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| These projects do need to make sense financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| We know what happens when they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| And so we need to adequately staff our apartment communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| And we need to provide amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| We need to provide landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| We need to do the things that make these attractive parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| And that does require density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| But if we can talk to our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| and come up with some solutions that maybe do make sense for both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| maybe we can come back and present something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| At least then you'd have a clearer idea of what it is you're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Yes, I think you just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| And Councilman Grieve mentioned, of course, the 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| And it appears that you are at least willing to look at 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| And that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| So I think you just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| So I'm going to withdraw my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| May I say something about what he just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| No, not unless one of the council members calls upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| Sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| Vice Mayor Patterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| I think this is exactly the same scenario that we had in South Knoxville with Gumpert, with his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| And, Will, I think most of the members of Council attended the meeting at South Knox Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| And there was a room full of people that were very angry, very angry about the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| And it was about the same numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| And now a year later, over a year later, you know, Mr. Gumpert has come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| and he's worked with the neighborhood, all the neighborhoods surrounding, not just Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| He's worked with the city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| And now he's got a project that is being, unless I'm being wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5466)|
| 1:31:12| but is being accepted by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| So he did the things necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| So I think we should give them a chance to at least get around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| And I appreciate Councilman Saunders bringing that up, making the motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| I mean, I don't know of any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| If they can't and if it's a density, then we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| We hang it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| But I think that it's reasonable for people to get around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| And the gentleman has said that they're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| And I know that, you know, everybody's voting and wanting to vote no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| But I think that we need to give each side at least one more chance to get around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and find a project that will add to the tax rolls of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| that will help the development, help the commercial side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| and add to the residential as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| So I'll support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Well, I'll call on Frank Slater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| He can come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| And just for a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| I think the vote tonight is to rezone the property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| If you vote no on the rezoning, it still can be developed with 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| We're not asking you to not allow apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| We're just asking you not to allow it to be rezoned where it could be 250 apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| and then get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Once you've done that, anything can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| We're just asking tonight to vote no on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| And we will be glad to work with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| although we met with them 100 days ago and haven't had a chance to talk to them since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| because they keep telling us no more density is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| So we've been stiff-armed for 100 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| and it looks to us like the only reason they're interested in talking about it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| is because this was slipping away tonight, which is suspect in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| George thinks I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| It's not a theory if it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| But if you will vote no tonight on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| we can still develop this property with 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| All we're asking you is not let it get bigger than that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| It's already zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| It's zoned where you can have 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| We've been through enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| Please don't postpone this any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| They have drug us around for all summer, stiff-arming us and avoiding us and not talking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5609)|
| 1:33:37| Just because they're going to lose doesn't mean they should get an extra period to keep fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5617)|
| 1:33:44| Please vote no on the rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| Don't postpone it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| Let them build 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| And like I told Arthur, I'll be there with the shovel and the champagne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| We're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| We're not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Just don't let it get any bigger than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| I have a question to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| The comment about density having to stay at 248 with the conversation we had this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| In other words, the property is zoned for 160, which you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| And now what you're asking for with the rezoning is to do away with the guidelines and to do 248 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5661)|
| 1:34:28| So we know that seems to be part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| The other problem is what Vice Mayor Pavlis has said is the total lack of communication between the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5671)|
| 1:34:39| And also as far as us having information, I kind of find it a little difficult to understand that with you folks developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| as many projects as you have and the quality of the work that you do, and you all do do good projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| that you didn't understand the guidelines until recently since we started this some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| So I'm having a little difficulty with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| But I do want to know if density is the question, then we can take care of this tonight and move on to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5700)|
| 1:35:08| Yeah, I think to answer the density, with the price that we're paying for the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| and the economics of this specific site, we can't do 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Now, is there a number that's less than 248?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| You know, we'll have to analyze that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| But I can stand here tonight and tell you that based on what the deal is with the landowner and, you know, he can be expressed to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5724)|
| 1:35:33| you know, Ben represents him that he can hold this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And so, you know, unfortunately, we just can't do 160 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| Now, is there a number a little bit less than that that we'd be willing to look at? Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| Well, the conversation we had in my office a couple of weeks ago before this came up the first time was the fact that it appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| that in order to make the project work, you had to have at least 250 units with the analysis that you did at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| And if that's still the case, then that's where we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not going to stand here and tell you that we can get it to 180 either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| You know, if, you know, obviously, if density and, again, what a lot of the comments that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| and, you know, I think that Ryan may have heard when he met was, you know, town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| And we feel like we've come, you know, a long way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| And, you know, whether we, you know, we can look at it and say, you know, can we draw X number of units, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| to get this to work for the neighbors, you know, we're willing to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| But I can confidently tell you we can't do 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| Cannot do 160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| I mean, just the economics of the deal will not work in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5800)|
| 1:36:47| Had the school not been built there, there is a —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| I've tried to count what you could potentially have done between the school site and this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| or transfer development rights from another piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| There were contemplated, I think, well over 400 residential units between the school site and this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| Now, the school site's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| There are no development rights that can be transferred to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| But how many acres is the school sitting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| At least 10, I would think, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| 18 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| That's 28 acres to divide all those units over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Now what we're trying to do is we're trying to squeeze down to 10 acres and put 258 units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| Unfortunately, they have to answer to their lender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| Oh, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Whether they can do 180 or 220, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5861)|
| 1:37:49| That's their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| They have analyzed 160 units for this site and can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| I've got to believe that as we talk and go, as you know, our plans were recently changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5878)|
| 1:38:06| and we're now looking at a different building type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| I think we're going to need to really evaluate construction costs and some other factors will come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| But we just don't know right now what would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| But I think, just thinking to myself, I know construction costs are going to play a factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| because this is a different building type and a different building material than what we had originally submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| And it's just likely to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| But we should have a better handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| I appreciate the fact of, I mean, I understand the construction costs and that sort of thing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| But, again, what we understand is that the neighborhood is concerned about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| I'm concerned about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| I'm concerned about that site in terms of what it's going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| And with all due respect, I do believe that that site will be eventually developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| It may not be this year, but it will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| And I think that sometimes we have to look at the quality of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| and the quality of what we're looking at in terms of the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| and not necessarily the bottom line, which is the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| And I'm not against having more taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| but I think at the same time we need to look at the types of projects that are being developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| and where they are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| So that's a concern that I have about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| Okay, so we right now have a motion to postpone for six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| Ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| We're going to do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| Okay, the motion to postpone six weeks passes 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| So we'll be back in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| That would be on all three items, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| Well, right, because we can't consider B and C without having passed 12A, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| I want everyone to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| So nobody has signed up for public forum, so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131001?start=6016)|
