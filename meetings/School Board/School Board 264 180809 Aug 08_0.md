| 0:01:12| on but if there should be one here please raise your hand so we can acknowledge you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| Okay then we'll go on into announcements and this one is very important. Board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| just a reminder that you should have received an email link to your annual board evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=84)|
| 0:01:29| survey several days ago. Please complete the survey no later than Friday, August 17th so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| that we can have the results back in plenty of time for our annual workshop later in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Finally on behalf of the board, I want to say welcome back to all the students who attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=103)|
| 0:01:47| school for the first half day of 2018-2019 school year. We hope you have a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| year and are honored to serve you and your families and I know speaking as a former teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=114)|
| 0:02:00| this is one of the most exciting days of the year so welcome back students and we welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| back the teachers last time. Any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| Madam Chair, I would like to add an agenda item to continue our discussion from last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| time regarding the kindergarten portfolio. So discussion and possible action on kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Ms. Rountree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Thank you Madam Chair. I was just going to mention we wrapped up our last work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=148)|
| 0:02:38| so quickly that we forgot about board forums. So I was going to suggest adding that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| evening in case any board member has news they'd like to share. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Thank you. So there are two changes suggested to the agenda. One is adding the continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| discussion of the portfolio with possible action and the second is to add board forums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=173)|
| 0:02:59| since I closed the meeting without it last time. Okay, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Ms. Rountree seconded by Mr. Norman. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Aye. All opposed? Motion carries. We have several recognitions this evening and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| our first recognition I would like to introduce Dr. Lyle Alshie. Dr. Alshie is the Deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Commissioner for College, Career and Technical Education and Teachers and Leaders at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| Tennessee Department of Education and he joins us this evening for a very special presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| Dr. Alshie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Thank you Madam Chairman and fellow board members and Dr. Thomas. It's a pleasure to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| be here with you tonight and it's a particular pleasure to be able to give this award. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=223)|
| 0:03:49| this is the second piece you may know that Ms. Franklin from West High School received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| the Milken Award earlier this year and she got the important piece which was her check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| then. But there's been a couple of scheduling conflicts I think in getting the obelisk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| her and I wanted you to know and her to know that I was determined to get it. I think I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| came through the rain of the century, a flood, a couple of wrecks and I parked in the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| garage but it's here and I'm here to deliver it tonight one way or the other. So it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| a pleasure to be here and it's always fun to be able to recognize teachers. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| that. So I have a few comments here but let me say first I got to meet Ms. Franklin just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| a few minutes before we started and I'm already envious when I heard about the number or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| percentage of students at West High School that's in an IB program that she's a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| of. You should be commended. I know how hard it is to start one of those and to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| one of those. So I just want to throw that in as extra credit tonight because I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| hearing great things going on in school systems. Okay, let me get to my script now. Ms. Paula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| Franklin of West High School was one of 45 individuals that was named a Milken Educator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| for the 2017-18 school year. She did, as I said, receive her $25,000 cash prize back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| in November but because of various circumstances we haven't been able to get this obelisk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| her. And at that time when she received her check, the Milken Family Foundation Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| and Co-Founder, Lowell Milken, and Dr. McQueen, the Commissioner of Education, was able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| surprise her and do that in front of her peers and students and other dignitaries and media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| to give her some extra attention there as well. Now this evening we want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| to recognize her by formally giving her this obelisk and the Milken Awards, there's a quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| that I really like in their awards program and it says this, first of all it's been recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| by the Teacher Magazine as the Oscars of Teaching. I think that's pretty good. And then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| on to say that this has been opening minds and shaping futures for 30 years. Research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=358)|
| 0:06:07| shows obviously, and we know this, that the quality of a good teacher cannot be underestimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| and it's the number one in-school factor for student success. And the Milken Family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Foundation rewards great teachers, thankfully. They seek to celebrate, elevate, and activate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| those innovators in classrooms. There are so many like Ms. Franklin, we're sure. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=384)|
| 0:06:30| of the goals of the Milken Educator Award is to honor and reward outstanding K-12 educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| for the quality of their teaching, their professional leadership, I think that's key. We talk a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| lot about teacher leadership and their engagement with families and the community, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| their potential for even greater contributions to the healthy development of children. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| sure that everyone here already knows much more about Ms. Franklin's accolades and accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| than I do, but it's a testimony to her commitment to the students of West High School and of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| Knox County, and I think we'll agree that from what I've already seen of her and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| credentials and reading about her, my goodness, what a fine candidate and a recipient we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| here tonight. She sets high expectations and demonstrates her own commitment to their success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| She incorporates instructional practices such as simulations, cooperative learning projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| writing assignments, and even works to develop a historical basis as well as a critical analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| of our American democracy so they can be thinking, active, and engaged citizens. Her classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| is a trusted environment which encourages fairness for opinions to be freely expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| in her seminar-type discussions. Her hard work and expectations have paid off in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| to all the IB numbers that I mentioned earlier. This is another remarkable number. Eighty-two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| percent of her AP government students passed their AP exams with a score of 3.59, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| is way beyond the national average of 50 percent and a score of 2.65. My goodness. Ms. Franklin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| is a teacher, a coach, and a role model for her students and peers. She has a knack for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| teaching others how to teach well. Don't we all wish that we could do that? She leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| professional development sessions for government teachers throughout the school system and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| mentors new teachers. And beyond academics, Ms. Franklin supports students in their extracurricular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| activities. I understand she does the prom and also does cheerleading in her free time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| And you know what? She's been here her whole career, right? She's a graduate of UTK. She's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| chosen to work here, earned a bachelor of arts degree in political science with a minor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| in history and secondary education and a master's in secondary education. Finally, I know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| believe fully that the state of Tennessee, the Knox County Schools, and West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| take pride in recognizing Ms. Paula Franklin's commitment to students, her peers, and her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| community. And on behalf of the Commissioner of Education and the Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| it is a great pleasure to recognize Ms. Paula Franklin once again as a teacher at West High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=553)|

| 0:13:44| as promising practice school for significant progress toward high quality practices in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=824)|

| 0:14:05| use of research-based strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=845)|

| 0:31:55| Since my initial inquiry about two years ago, I've been informed that Knox County has a new computer system in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1915)|
| 0:32:04| with standalone data center that is currently being programmed as fast as any humans could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1924)|
| 0:32:12| Kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Knox County also uses the state accounting model for the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| That annual audit is extremely difficult for me to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1939)|

| 0:32:53| The same saying is also useful to describe the foxes trying to get in the hen house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| as much as it is the responsibility of our present strategic plan to add meaningful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| obtainable, monitored, transparent, easily accessible, easy to understand financial data upon request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| which Knox County should be able to pull up with a few keystrokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| I do understand that in order for Knox County to be able to pull up its expenditures, especially to the penny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| our new computer program must be programmed on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| If we don't program on the front end, Knox County cannot produce the requested data on expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| In regard to fundraisers, sponsorships, donations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| with one number going in and one number going out as in professional bookkeeping practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2025)|
| 0:33:53| the computer age has arrived in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| We now have the full ability to create data to improve how Knox County spends its money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| $484.5 million does have potential to be a challenge in full accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2044)|
| 0:34:16| Change is hard, but I feel certain that Knox County is up to the challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2056)|
| 0:34:23| especially since we want Knox County to be the best school system in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2063)|
| 0:34:30| It can be done. It can't be done overnight and will initially require more software computer programmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| Any money spent on programmers will save all that money down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| All money spent on training staff from central office to bookkeepers at each school will improve efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2084)|

| 0:34:56| Our new computer system has unlimited potential to track our money down to the last penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| Knox County has a silver bullet, a newly discovered antibiotic at its disposal to improve their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| to keep more foxes out of the hen house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| Just like the teachers put in long extra hours in data analysis, waste analysis, collecting data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| many hours ongoing in order to improve their performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| so can our financial department learn lessons from our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| As a taxpayer, I expect no less than exemplary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| I'm requesting more concrete, measurable, accounting, transparent, easily understood monitoring objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2139)|

| 0:36:07| I see that the extremely valuable resource of Knox County teachers, input, well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| working in a non-hostile environment, nurtured in a positive teaching culture, not being bullied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| not being afraid to speak up out of fear for losing their jobs is absent from this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| I'm requesting that measurable goals and concrete objectives with timelines be added to this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Help, help, help, and help the teachers in this important strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| so they will remain and stay with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| Thank you, Ms. Long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2200)|

| 0:36:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| With the exception of bus routes, most students' school day begins in the classroom and ends in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2217)|
| 0:37:06| All the goals we set and the methodology we decide to use have to go through the classroom teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| and special skill teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| My understanding is that we have plenty of classes with over 20 students and some with over 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| When one teacher has to teach 20-plus students all day, all year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| even the talented and gifted teachers will have more bad days than good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| unless you're Ms. Franklin, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| Congratulations to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| A bad day could be when students need a little extra attention because of some bad circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| and doesn't get it, or a student that got bullied on the bus or in the bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| and tried to ask for help but didn't get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| or a student that was ready to move on to the next chapter but was given busy work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| while the teacher helped the other kids catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| or a student acting totally out of character all class long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| but there was no time for the classroom teacher to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| The strategic plan draft should show that steps are being taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| and that the plan includes looking at studies and results of what happens in classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| with lower student-teacher ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| The plan should show that the district is looking at teacher and staff compensation practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| and what effect it has on long-term employment and success in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| It appears to a lot of people that the Knox County school budget is out of date and insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| At the same time, the life of the students have become more demanding, both academically and socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| Unfortunately, our students face some real scary possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| at a time they should be discovering, experimenting, and problem-solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| This last April gave us a hint of the financial crisis we are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| with no accredited or classified staff getting a raise to try to keep up with inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| while all the other civil workers in Knoxville and Knox County did receive raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| Our strategic plan barely mentions staff compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| I saw no intentions to look at studies about student-teacher ratios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| and to analyze the repercussions of lower or raising student-teacher ratios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| I saw little mention of exploring hiring more special teachers and social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| to support the classroom teachers' work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| The strategic plan should have goals that work and should deal with what the cost will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| This should be transparent and shared with the community by November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2401)|
| 0:40:08| not February, right before the vote for a new budget comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| We should be hearing about the need to increase funding for our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| and not by dismantling programs for the challenged student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| or the gifted student that are serving their intended purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| These are some reasons that I think the strategic plan should be discussed more before finalizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| Please do not rush to pass this draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you. Madam Chair, that concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you. Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Oh, okay, Ms. Owen, we'll come to you first, and then Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| As I sat down with teacher after teacher this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| it became obvious that there is no conceivable way that teacher error could be solely blamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| for the problems we are seeing with the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Oh, I'm on the wrong thing. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| You were confusing me, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I'm sorry. I'll come back to that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Okay. You want to speak to the strategic plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I have quite a lot of stress over both of these, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| That's the right piece of paper now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| As we ask for names of people who were interviewed for our strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| it struck me that these were given to us not as a list of people who were involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| but instead their comments with their names redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And the comments went along with the exact same questions that were asked in our community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2501)|
| 0:41:48| which are also the exact same questions that were available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| So I'm very concerned that we spent a great deal of staff time going out to 28 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2512)|
| 0:42:03| Yes, there are just 26 on the list you have in your email, but there were 28 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| And taking time to sit down with those 28 people and ask them to give feedback that could have been given online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2528)|
| 0:42:19| that could have been given in community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| Many of the folks that are listed here are government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| who could have easily attended those community meetings and given that feedback there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| However, those are not my largest concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| My largest concern about the list of people is that when it was finally given to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2558)|
| 0:42:46| it doesn't contain all of the names. There are two names missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| Also, under local government, we include people who were running in primaries at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2570)|
| 0:43:01| but were not part of local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| And I think it's very important to note that three of our mayoral candidates were interviewed and two were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2584)|
| 0:43:13| So we had the three male candidates interviewed. The two female candidates were not interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2593)|
| 0:43:21| It just also happens that also breaks down by party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| However, that may have happened is not as concerning as that it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2606)|
| 0:43:35| Two of those people I wouldn't have thought twice about if I'd seen them on the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| because they currently serve in office, but one of them does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| And so it concerns me that we made quite an assumption about that person's potential in that race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2626)|
| 0:43:56| whether or not it turned out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| I don't think we should be interviewing political candidates for a strategic plan for the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| in our district unless we include every person running for political office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| So that is the largest concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| I would like to have all of their comments taken out and removed from any consideration in our strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2658)|
| 0:44:27| Beyond that, what we have are pages of mismatched information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| pages that frankly look like several different departments did different work without ever having a discussion with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2674)|
| 0:44:44| As a strategic plan for this district, it's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2684)|
| 0:44:49| The only way I would consider voting for this is if we very specifically said that we are voting on it only as a draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2689)|
| 0:44:58| which will be continued in a large meeting with all of our board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| That's the only way I would even consider this to have potential for us to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| When we say that it's a living document, yes, it does change over time, but that time is expected to be three years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2711)|
| 0:45:22| So it doesn't live the same way our procedures and policies live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| So if we're going to adopt a strategic plan, it needs to be a complete strategic plan when it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| If this is going to be considered as a first draft and accepted as a very first draft with a huge amount of work to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2734)|
| 0:45:47| I think that's the only way it can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Okay, next we'll go over to Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| If Ms. Giegert would like to respond to that, and then I can let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| I would, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| I'd like to respond to Ms. Owen's comments about why people were asked to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| In all the years I've done strategic plan, and back when we did nine counties, one vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and back when every plan I've been involved in, it was customary to invite every person running for political office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2771)|
| 0:46:21| who might have something to do with the plan once it was in place to get their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| Everyone was asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| I can't respond to who chose to respond or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| I did not ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| All I'm saying is that that was the thinking behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| There was nothing nefarious behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| I suspect most of the people doing the interviewing were not of the political party of the people that were interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| I don't know that, but it really doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| That's one of the sad things that we've come to is that we now worry so much about party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| It was really just trying to talk to people who might be a mayor when this plan was being executed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2822)|
| 0:47:13| because it would have financial ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| If you want to disqualify their comments, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| I don't think any of those things changed dramatically what people said they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2838)|
| 0:47:25| It was more a courtesy to speak to elected officials who often don't come to public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| because of other commitments that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| That was the only reason that was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| If you want to throw out all their comments, you can throw out all their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| I am not going to sit here and on my last meeting demand that the board have a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2862)|
| 0:47:51| I did what this board asked me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| This board asked me to put together a process like I had done in the past to do a strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2873)|
| 0:48:00| If people don't like the measurements and what's evaluated, it's up to board members to make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2880)|
| 0:48:10| We can't just keep coming here month after month telling the staff who wrote it we don't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| unless we tell them what we do want in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| We didn't hire an outside consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| We had staff write this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| I'm sure it was departments putting stuff together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Maybe it's not ready, but I think what concerns me a little bit about the tone I'm hearing in some of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| is that you think there's some nefarious something going on about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| If you don't want to have this plan, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Work on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| That's all I'm saying is that there's nothing ill will in here, and if we don't like what's being measured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| it's up to the board to tell the staff what we want measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| We can't just expect staff to come to these meetings and hear we don't like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| without any direction on what we do want to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| Thank you, Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| I think that we do need to have a board session to discuss this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| I think that it can be more focused, and there are some things that are missing that we need to have included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| So I think it's just not ready, and there are some improvements that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| So whether we want to move that to a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| or if we want to schedule a time when we can collaborate on what we would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2979)|
| 0:49:47| so that we are giving that direction to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| But I think we need to spend a dedicated time frame as a board discussing what we want to see in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=2991)|
| 0:50:01| because I know I have specific things that I would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and I would say some of you would concur, but we need to be able to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| So if we can just talk about perhaps what that process may look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| Thank you, Ms. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| You decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Then I'll go to Ms. Detheridge, and then I'll come to you, Ms. Owen, after she's had a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I guess I was going to say if that's the case, then that's where you have a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| And if that's what you want to do is go back and start over or massage it a little bit more and give you input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| then that's where you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| I'd just like to know how many board members responded to suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| and making changes to this in the past eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| What's the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| I mean, can I not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Are we taking a poll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Are we raising our hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| I guess I need to ask, not you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| but ask Mr. John Rogers or Mr. Clifford Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| I mean, how many did you read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Did everybody respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Because it's been out here, and I'm just saying we've had opportunity to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| Now we want to get together as a whole board and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| So I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| We did have responses from board members about things that they wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| We made those adjustments in the plan that's currently before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So we have already had input into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| So I guess my question is, it's not reflecting what we already want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| or is it we need to look at it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| And that's just a question we have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| But we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| I'm like, Ms. Fugate, I won't be here, and neither will Ms. Roundtree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| to even help massage it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| But we can massage it all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| It's a guideline that you give to your superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| that's what you want to do for the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| If you don't look at it, change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| But my thing is, we can meet, you can talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| you can do a retreat on it, you can do whatever you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| But if you've already submitted your suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| and they have been reflected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| I don't know how many more you're going to have to do in order to make it what you want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| But, like I said, I won't be here to worry about it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| But this board needs to decide which direction we want to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| and which way we're going to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| and at the same time make those kind of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| And when I hear people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| we don't have, we're not thinking about the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| we're not thinking about, we have an MOU with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| We're not talking about, we have guidelines, procedures, disparity studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| we have a lot of things that doesn't have to be to that level in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3151)|
| 0:52:37| We have policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| We have procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| This is a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| We have measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| Every year they're going to go back and you're going to look at the measurements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| and you're going to see how you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| and you're going to adjust it, you're going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| And I guess my, I don't know how many people have been involved in strategic plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| I personally have been involved with a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I don't know how many people have been on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I've been on quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| But it seems like we just get outside our lane a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| We try to do the central office staff and the superintendent's job a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| Sometimes we have to stand our lane and let them do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| If we want to do this, then maybe we need to go and ask the superintendent to hire us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| But at the same time, this is a guideline, this is a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| and let's just figure out what we want in it, make those changes, and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| That's for the future board and whoever sits in this seat next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you, Ms. Dethridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| I appreciate the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| Ms. Fugate, I don't want you going off this board feeling sour that you weren't appreciated for pulling this together and trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3227)|
| 0:53:57| I feel appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| I felt my integrity question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Well, I regret that you feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| That certainly is not shared by all board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3244)|
| 0:54:12| And the comments about who was talked to on this plan and whether it was elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3252)|
| 0:54:22| or people that were running for office or whatever that list might look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| what's really regretful to me in this whole thing is that, you know, we did put this out there almost a year early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| We did have meetings asking people what they wanted in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| You know, regretfully or for whatever reason, the people that were interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| and since I didn't go to every meeting, I don't know for sure who was or wasn't there, but I did go to two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| These people did not respond during public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| I commend the staff for going out and taking the time to try to get input from some elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3302)|
| 0:55:13| and those that stepped up to be willing to even run for office because everyone up here knows that's not an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| So the idea that people have not had a chance to give their input is just incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3322)|
| 0:55:33| It's just incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| It was put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| And, you know, I think even if we tried to do another round of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| we probably would not have any more participation than we've had to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| I mean, I don't know that for certain, but just given my history on the board for the last four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3349)|
| 0:55:54| with trying to get community involvement and public input, it has been very poor to say, to be kind about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3354)|
| 0:56:04| It's been very poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| So to Mrs. Dethrich's point about, you know, we can go on and on, but at some point we have got to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3366)|
| 0:56:18| You know, if it's the board's will, maybe we need to have a special called meeting and do nothing but discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| because we seem to have a difficult time during board meetings wanting to take the time that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3386)|
| 0:56:35| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| We've got a lot of other things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| To some of the comments, though, that were made about what the plan is lacking regarding class size and teacher compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3400)|
| 0:56:53| we have talked about teacher compensation and class size and the benefits of smaller classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| This is not a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| And the fact of the matter is it has been addressed in class size with some of our lower-performing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3425)|
| 0:57:18| They do have class sizes half what other schools that have not scored so low on testing have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3438)|
| 0:57:32| I mean, it isn't like we have not looked at class sizes and the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| It is not like we have not looked at teacher compensation and don't recognize that I think we are, what, 29th in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| and know that this is not good for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| These things have been looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| They have been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| They continue to be mentioned in the strategic plan, and compensation is not something that has been ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3475)|
| 0:58:04| It might appear that it's been ignored because this board has not been able to do what everyone up here would like to have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3484)|
| 0:58:13| and been able to offer more compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| But again, a strategic plan, it is not a written-in-gold document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| It is merely a roadmap for where we need to try to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3503)|
| 0:58:30| I struggle with some attitudes that it needs to be so final, that it needs to be so this is what we will do in a three-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3510)|
| 0:58:45| It is a roadmap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| And as Ms. Fugate, God love you, said a hundred times, it is fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| I think we make a real mistake trying to go for too much finality in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3535)|
| 0:59:07| Having said that, do I agree that it probably needs to be cleaned up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Absolutely, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Do I feel like this board, if we want to do this, we need to make more of a commitment to have the meeting and get this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| and not keep putting it back on our staff over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| This is not fair to them, and it's really not fair to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| It's been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| The community has had a chance to let us know what they want in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| This board has had a chance to state what we want in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Lack of participation from top to bottom becomes an issue honestly bigger than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3580)|
| 0:59:47| So I do support perhaps a special called meeting to discuss this and come up with some finality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3587)|
| 1:00:01| But, again, we do need to make a plan, and I hope we can make one tonight, to have some finality in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3601)|
| 1:00:13| We could do this for the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Ms. Rountree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| I just wanted to, I guess, two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| Throw out for consideration the idea of passing in draft form, just the summary document that's shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| I see Ms. Fugate nodding in agreement to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| I guess my other question is, as some of my colleagues have said, we are going off the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| But I do have a concern given the fact that it's the beginning of the school year and the amount of time that the staff has put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| And I think that as far as our curricular needs and serving our children and our schools, I'm just concerned about, I guess, to Ms. Hill's point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3649)|
| 1:01:01| So what is the plan going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Is it going to be continued to just go back to Dr. Davis and Dr. Reisel can say, okay, we want this massaged more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| I just, and I don't want to put these gentlemen on the spot and say, how much time have you spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| But I'll use Ms. Massey because I know she already left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| I know that particularly we have, as we voted on earlier, we have a gap to fill in our SPED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3679)|
| 1:01:26| And so I'm thinking about how much work she and her department and our SPED facilitators and our SPED teachers have on their plates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3686)|
| 1:01:35| The caseload is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I don't know that, for example, it's the most beneficial use of that department's time to come back and spend 10 more hours wordsmithing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3697)|
| 1:01:53| I don't, you know, when we have empty classrooms without teachers, I mean, I think we have, I guess, you know, we might have bigger fish to fry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3713)|
| 1:02:02| And that's not to say that the strategic plan is unimportant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| I just, if we aren't happy as a board with the language or the verbiage that the staff has used, then the suggestion of a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3725)|
| 1:02:15| who is going to put in the time and actually sit down and edit the document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| Because I fear that kicking it back to Dr. Davis and then all the subsequent departments is, at this time in the school year, not the best use of their time, given our current needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3741)|
| 1:02:35| So I'll just leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| And I will say, you know, as someone that attended the strategic plan meeting and plan to attend in the future and will be a future Knox County parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3757)|
| 1:02:49| and I have heard this from community members, there isn't an issue when we hold meetings and then no action is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| So I think that is something we have to think about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| We have low participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| What could be the root cause of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| I mean, I feel like the people that were at the meeting at South Doyle gave really great detailed input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| And so are we saying now that that is inadequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| We need more input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I'm just, I brought that up at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| How are we going to seek to engage people in a more authentic or different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Did you wish to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Yes, I'll make a substitute motion that the board approve as a first draft the strategic plan summary document, which is the two-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3808)|
| 1:03:39| And then, should I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Then you all can have a special called meeting to wordsmith it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| Okay, then we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| I'm just going to make, I'm going to re-amend my amended motion that we approve as a first draft the strategic plan summary document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3832)|
| 1:04:01| And that's a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Oh, is that a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Then Ms. Dugas seconds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| So any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| Do you wish to speak, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| I would like to respond to some earlier comments, if I could, that I've not had an opportunity to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3857)|
| 1:04:26| Is there a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Should we go to the other comments on the substitute first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| I'm sorry, what, Ms. Detheridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Ms. Detheridge has a question about the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| We're talking about approving just the two-page summary as a draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3884)|
| 1:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| And not anything else at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| At this point, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Which means it's not final either?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| It's just something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| Okay, Ms. Owen, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Do you have a comment on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| I do, and simply because I think that we can do that, but I think we still need to discuss what the follow-up will be after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| Ms. Owen, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| I would like to agree with Ms. Hill that this should not be on our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| We should not be spending hours and hours and hours of staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| And we had one staff member who interviewed all of those 28 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| That's not a good use of that person's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| especially when that person is a talent and acquisition specialist at the time of year when we need to be hiring staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| That's problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| If we are going to call this the board's plan, it needs to be the board's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| If we are going to have the staff do it, the staff needs to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| There's nothing that I said to indicate that there was anything nefarious in what was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3961)|
| 1:06:10| I think it was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| I don't think it was nefarious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| If I thought it was nefarious, I'd say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| I would say so very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| The problem I have is that when I have requested this information, the answers I'm getting don't match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| My request for information, when I ask specifically how these interviewees were selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| the word candidate is nowhere here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| And so I have no way to know that information because it wasn't included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=3997)|
| 1:06:43| It wasn't disclosed at any step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| And when I requested information from the administration, I did not get that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| So I have no way to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| All I can do is look at a list of people, which I had a hard time getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| and try to glean how they came to be part of that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| So if we, whatever we do, if we are going to be transparent at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| we need to put all of the information available out there so that everyone is very clear with exactly what we are doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4032)|
| 1:07:22| and exactly how these decisions were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| It's not to say that anything nefarious was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| It's to say that it's unclear, that it's confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and that nobody up here really knows the answers to a lot of these questions that we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| And that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| I just want to respond and then I'm going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| Because she's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| I really wish that the times I had made reports to the Board, someone had asked me what this was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4067)|
| 1:07:54| I should have been more detailed and told you all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| I've made reports, talked about interviewing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| I apologize if you feel like that you weren't given enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| I did not know you were asking for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| I would have been happy to give it to you myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| But with that, Madam Chair, I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| We need to vote on are we accepting this two-page summary or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Second, Ms. Fugate and Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| I've asked her to read the substitute motion that was made by Mr. Autry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| And seconded by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Oh, you want me to read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| Don't you ever have a two-third vote to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| Yeah, because Mike had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Oh, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Well, we have to approve the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| Go ahead, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| Since this is just a draft, at least since I've been here, we've never done it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| But that doesn't mean that it's wrong necessarily or there's anything wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| But in the past, I believe that we have voted on the actual plan twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4136)|
| 1:09:04| Is that not right, Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Since we've been here the same amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| I guess my question is, I guess since this is a draft, it only requires one vote if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4149)|
| 1:09:18| But can anybody tell me if once we put a plan, an actual plan in place, will it require two readings or one reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4158)|
| 1:09:30| Mr. Buford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| That's a good question, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I mean, I've not researched that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| I mean, you know, this is – but a plan is akin to a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| So without doing some further research, which I will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| two readings would certainly be proper since all of the Board's policies do require two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| unless there are exceptional circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Ms. Stathridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Why are we approving a draft anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I mean, it's a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I'm like Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It's a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| It's not the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| Why are we going through this motion to approve a draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| Well, it's a motion now, a substitute motion that we'll need to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| You can vote yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| But my point is you don't approve a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| I mean, you can, but go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Mr. M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4249)|
| 1:10:50| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| Are we going to have a roll call on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| If you would like to, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Ms. Coatney, would you read the substitute motion made by Ms. Rountree and seconded by Ms. Stugat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| And then we'll do a roll call vote starting with District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| The substitute motion is to approve as a first draft the strategic plan summary document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| Ms. Stathridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| No, it's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Did that include future work in the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| Or is it just to accept it as a draft?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| My motion was just to accept it as a draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Ms. Rountree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| That's five yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| I see all these lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| I'm not sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| I'm like, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| So five yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| That was the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Ms. Rountree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| And I was just going to open the floor up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| I think Ms. Horne's idea of either setting a meeting or having a committee to further solidify the plan would be a good idea for the board to discuss at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4340)|
| 1:12:31| Thank you, Ms. Rountree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Mr. Dupler, before the board begins to discuss it, do you have any recommendations on that or any opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4353)|
| 1:12:40| Is Ms. Rountree making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| I was making it just for discussion purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| I mean, I don't think that Lynn and Gloria or I should be deciding what the next step should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4370)|
| 1:12:58| The law director's position would be that a motion and a second needs to be made if the board is going to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| I make a motion to discuss the next steps for the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| And seconded by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| So now we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Ms. Huguett, do you want to lead out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I'd like to make a substitute motion that this be put on the board's retreat agenda to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4399)|
| 1:13:29| I accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Or I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| It's called passing the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| So we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Amber seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| So we are voting on a substitute motion to put this topic on the board's retreat agenda to discuss how they want to move forward with the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4427)|
| 1:13:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you, Ms. Huguett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| So the board will need to vote on the substitute motion, and if the substitute motion passes, then the issue is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| If the substitute motion does not pass, then you go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| Yes, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| Just as a matter of procedure, Mr. Dupler, is a new board bound by a decision made by an old board on what should be on the new board's agenda for a retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4455)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| A new board is not bound in the way that it votes on issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| This board can go ahead and set an agenda for a retreat, but certainly before that retreat comes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4487)|
| 1:14:57| a new board could make a decision to tweak that agenda, take it off, amend it, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4497)|
| 1:15:05| So this board cannot bind a future board in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| So we have the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| So all in favor of the substitute motion made by Ms. Roundtree and seconded by Ms. Horn to take this up at the board retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4520)|
| 1:15:30| Made by Lynn, seconded by Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| How could y'all make it any more difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| I'm beginning to think that, Ms. Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| Discussion and possible action on kindergarten portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Ms. Owen to Ms. Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Now I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I'm the person signed up for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| Yes, we'll have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| I don't know if Ms. Owen wants to go ahead and speak, but there is, I guess you're going to reference Ms. Patchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| She signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Go ahead, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Hopefully I'll get her in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| So if Ms. Patchen would like to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| This is what I'm really wadded up about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| So it is all that I have thought about for several days after I sat down with teachers in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4591)|
| 1:16:40| And a process that I've seen and a process that I understood made absolutely no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4600)|
| 1:16:48| Don't be this ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| I'm going to talk for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| There's no way our teachers can be solely blamed for the problems that went on, having seen the evidence that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| And I hope every board member before Friday, because there's a deadline attached that I'll explain in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| I hope every board member can go and sit down with a kindergarten teacher and look at their portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| Even those kindergarten teachers who feel like they had no problems, if you really talk to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| 100% of the teachers I talked to had some kind of major problem with their portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| That's not teacher error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| This information should have been reported to the board last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| but instead we received that canned answer that the state has given over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| As a board, we expect to be supplied with the most accurate information available so that we can make good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| We expect it to be from reliable sources, and that's not what happened last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| This information was not only extraordinarily incomplete, but some of it was simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| Our State Department of Education has difficulty accepting accountability, and we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| We also know that we hold ourselves in our district to a higher standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| and we expect full disclosure of all available information for us to be able to function as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| When we don't get complete, accurate, reliable information from our staff, it's detrimental to our ability to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| I should not need to spend hours on hours gathering information from teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Their supervisors should already know this information, and they should have shared it with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| If we're not getting that information, I would strongly encourage our superintendent to deal with that however necessary to ensure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4714)|
| 1:18:44| Last year, kindergarten teachers across the state were required to use the portfolio system for 35% of their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| This was passed by our Tennessee Statehouse unanimously and by our Senate with only three dissenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| This was a plan that almost all of our legislators could agree on to support teachers and do the right thing for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| That is huge. They never agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| And unanimously in the House, it's almost unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4750)|
| 1:19:17| Though Knox County Schools had piloted a portfolio for arts teachers in 2013 that I was also part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| followed later by a K-2 pilot, that vetted platform that we used is not the platform the state provided for our kindergarten teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4763)|
| 1:19:33| Instead, they chose a new, untested, unfamiliar platform, which they announced very late with training even later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| Teachers were given bad information and timely information throughout the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| Teachers at high motility schools were at an immediate disadvantage because they had fewer students to draw from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| And it's important to understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| If you have 20 students at the beginning of the year, 10 move out, 10 move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| the only students you can use for data are the 10 that were there originally and that are still there at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4800)|
| 1:20:09| That's all you have for data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| The state kept changing the rules, releasing new rubrics after teachers had already collected evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| Districts across the state provided inconsistent training and misinformation to their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| And teachers spent hours creating these portfolios to match developmentally inappropriate rubrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| that asked five-year-olds to perform tasks far beyond what they should be doing in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| It's also important to note that if you look at the rubric the teacher was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| and you look at the rubric the evaluators were given, they're not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| So the person scoring their work has completely different guidelines from the person submitting the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4845)|
| 1:20:54| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| The state missed two deadlines to return scores and feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| And, again, I hope every board member takes time to look at the completely worthless feedback that our teachers have been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4860)|
| 1:21:08| What they have is a list of possible options of things that they might have done wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| It has nothing to do with the actual work that they turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| Then, late on June 25th, teachers finally received scores, but many of their submissions had never been scored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| resulting in an automatic lowest score of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| And when we open up the report, what it shows is that no reviewer even looked at the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| There's no feedback, but we can see that the questioned item was never even escalated to another reviewer as protocol requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4893)|
| 1:21:42| The state then released a document stating that the only reason a portfolio would appear to be unscored would be teacher error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4902)|
| 1:21:52| When teachers sent emails, the response from districts and from the state was either to resend that same email from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4912)|
| 1:22:01| or to send them somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| The state pointed to districts, the districts pointed to the state, and everybody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4923)|
| 1:22:08| it's the teacher's fault, it's the teacher's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| And I want to break from this narrative to ask how this possibly makes any sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4931)|
| 1:22:17| If I told a student that I had decided to grade three of his four assignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4937)|
| 1:22:24| and that all four will still make up his average, but I'm going to give that ungraded one 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| I don't think there is a person anywhere who would back me up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| No one is going to tell me that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| Yet we have been here allowing our Department of Education to do exactly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4958)|
| 1:22:45| I can't imagine refusing to give feedback or an explanation of a score to any student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| I can't imagine refusing to help or even acknowledge a struggling student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| But this is exactly the response from our State Department of Ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| and even from our own Knox County Administration, according to 100% of the teachers I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4981)|
| 1:23:10| In other words, we have a 100% failure rate in responding to our teachers' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| in helping our teachers grow, in making our teachers feel valued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| and in building a positive culture regarding the kindergarten portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| We all know that a high rate of failure in a test generally means that the measure was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| The Department of Education has to know this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| But in an award-winning display of butt covering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| the Tennessee Department of Education announced that there would no longer be access to the data after August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| That's why you need to go see it by Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| because they actually intend to erase all of that evidence that all of our teachers have put into the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| along with any way of proving the teacher did nothing wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| All of their collections will be gone, they have been told, after August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| Today I was told that there actually is a way to download and save files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and that is going to be a surprise to all the teachers I've talked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| I was told there is a way to download and save files, but oddly, our teachers have been told the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| Why would the Department of Education keep this information from our teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| Most of them have been told that the only way to keep their files is to go through a tedious process of taking screenshots of every collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5071)|
| 1:24:40| at least 24 evidence collections, and the 24 cover pages teachers had to write to accompany each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| When I heard teachers saying, oh, but we had to write a page to go with each of our collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5088)|
| 1:24:55| in my mind, I was thinking, okay, four sets, four pages, okay, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| They had to write 24 sets, because they had to have that cover page to explain every set of data that they gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5103)|
| 1:25:15| With or without evidence, the grievance process is a punitive measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| It's been clearly constructed to punish those who expect to be treated with even the most basic respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5120)|
| 1:25:28| A grievance is supposed to be a time when you say, here is what is wrong, and here is how I expect it to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5128)|
| 1:25:38| The State Department of Education has given our teachers none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| They've said, hey, if you grieve it, you can take the school-wide score, and that is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5142)|
| 1:25:49| Even though the teacher's evidence is there, their documentation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| Teachers I've talked to also don't want to put extra work on their colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| They feel like it would be unreasonable to ask all of those scorers to come back and score all those pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5161)|
| 1:26:12| because there are a lot of them that weren't scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| They feel like it's unreasonable at the beginning of the year to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5175)|
| 1:26:21| They still would like their work to be graded, but they understand it's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| They feel that it would be completely reasonable to average the scores of those collections that were scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5187)|
| 1:26:37| There's nothing that absolutely proves that any teacher error actually caused any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| There's nothing in their collections that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| Their collections are there, except for some that were there and then later weren't, which is also no fault of theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5208)|
| 1:26:56| So it would be reasonable to grade the ones or to average the ones that have been scored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5216)|
| 1:27:04| and to leave out the one that, for whatever reason, the State Department did not score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5224)|
| 1:27:13| And I want to mention something that occurred at one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5233)|
| 1:27:18| Four kindergarten teachers used the exact same worksheet or set of worksheets, rather, to score their students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5238)|
| 1:27:31| They all turned in the exact same kind of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| So they all used the same tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| Every one of them had a different collection that was not scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| So for one, their math was not scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| For one, their language was not scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And they can't find any rhyme or reason to why when everything looks the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| It doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| And it looks to me like this process has always been set up to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| Our legislators, our State Board, our State Department of Education expect teachers to be accomplished professionals, and they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| The expectation that they are also flawless in everything they do is as absurd as this process is absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| We can't let our Department of Education keep telling us that, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| their statewide failure of their systems is the fault of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| And at some point, we have to call it like we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| Madam Chair, I would like to say two more sentences after Natasha's presentation, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Go ahead and call her up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Ms. Patchen, as you're coming up, let me clarify that Ms. Patchen, good evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| is here at Ms. Owen's request to present some beneficial information to this Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| She is not speaking in public forum, but she is here at the Board member's request to present this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| so that you can see for yourself what the kindergarten teachers are referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| So, Ms. Patchen, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| My name is Natasha Patchen, and I am a kindergarten teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| I would like to give you some information about the kindergarten portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| Nearly one year ago, I came before this Board to express my concerns about the kindergarten portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5366)|
| 1:29:32| In that speech, I stated that I was concerned about what this poorly designed and implemented portfolio would do to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| Well, now I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| My overall score is a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| When you break that down, I received a 4, a 5, and another 5 on three collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| On my fourth collection, I received a score of 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| What could be wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| I went to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| There were my self-scores, but there was no score from a peer reviewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and there was no explanation as to why I received that 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| So how am I supposed to fix the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| These are the reasons that the State Department of Education said you could receive a score of 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| No standard was identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| I identified my standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| No context form was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| I submitted all context forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| Multiple math standards were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| I identified one math standard for each area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| A different standard was referenced in the context form than shown in the student work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| I used the same standard for the context form and the student work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| Same student work was uploaded for different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| I didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Teacher checklist was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| I did not use the checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| The student sample was not viewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| My samples were clear and complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| While my collection was correctly submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| I can understand how a teacher might have some problems submitting evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| To upload my context forms and evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| I had to have my 20-year-old computer-savvy son at my side telling me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| I had to go through a 10-step process, and I had to do it 24 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| I do not know how many steps were involved in the uploading of my picture evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| My son did that with me looking over his shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| It would be so easy to make a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and that is why the legislature made this a pilot year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| Even if a teacher made a mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| why not thoroughly explain what was wrong and give some kind of credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| other than just assigning a one to the collection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| This portfolio is fraught with problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| What about teachers who must deal with some challenging life situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| during the portfolio process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| At my school, two teachers faced such a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| One teacher took a leave of absence to be with her dying father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| Another teacher completed her portfolio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| even while she was staring down brain surgery for her daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| She had issues with her portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| How is the State Department going to handle those types of situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| In my speech last year, I noted that it seemed the State Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| wanted us to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Why would they leave a portfolio collection unscored with no feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| Why would they not investigate our claims?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| The State Department of Education is holding fast to their accusations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| that teachers have submitted incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| This problem is far too widespread to ignore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| The State Department of Education recently posted that 78% of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| were scored a 3, 4, or 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Is that supposed to keep those of us that were affected placated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| We were scored inaccurately or not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| We want to be taken seriously, and we want this fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| I have been told that I can grieve the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| If I grieve this score, the state will vacate my scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| and I will have to take my pre-selected school-wide score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| which, like all teachers, is selected by taking the very best guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| as to which subject score my school will do best on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| before the test is even taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| It is like throwing a dart at a moving target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| I may end up with an even lower score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| Now we are told that we will be doing a new portfolio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| on a new data-collecting platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| We have not had any training on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| We have not even seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| So once again, we will be training as we fly on a broken-down portfolio plane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| I ask you to please let us do this on school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| From this point, all of our PLC sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| all of our district learning session days need to be focused on this new portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| We do not need to be spending our precious family time doing this all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| And once again, we will need to ask the legislature to make this a pilot year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| We have no faith in our State Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| and we are rapidly losing faith in our elected leaders who support this fiasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| Here are three solutions, though I do not know who can enact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| as there is plenty of finger-pointing going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| End this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Student data should never be attached to a teacher evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| There are too many things that are out of our control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| and that would be the topic of a five-minute or longer speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Give teachers their score based on what was scored correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| Investigate the scores with issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| though that would undoubtedly take even more time and money in this failed system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Last year I said I was weary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| I was weary of the words rigorous and robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| I would like to introduce three new words, relevant, realistic, and respect-worthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5708)|
| 1:35:17| Our students still deserve a developmentally appropriate curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| and teachers deserve a well-thought-out, well-tested, fair, and accurately scored growth measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5723)|
| 1:35:32| Now, I have my portfolio here, and it's up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| Oh, it is up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| If you would care to look at it or ask questions or have me walk you through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| I think if you could walk us through a little bit like you did with me, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5747)|
| 1:35:52| Okay, so this is the operations and algebraic thinking that I got a score of one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| If you look at my emergent student, and you'll need to slide down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5758)|
| 1:36:08| you'll see that I got a score of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| You'll see my name at the top and three circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Those three circles indicate the three, and there's actually five, but you can't see them all, standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5774)|
| 1:36:23| You will also notice beside my name at the top, there are no circles beside that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| That means, as far as I can tell, no one else scored my portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| It's just my score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| If we could please go to the evidence now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5797)|
| 1:36:43| Here you see my context form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| It states the domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| It states the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| That standard is the same standard you saw on the other page, and it had that circle with the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5810)|
| 1:36:58| If you go down the page, you'll see all the things that I had to write to justify my score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| for the student evidence that you will see next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| If you will please turn to my student evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| This is a student that is below average at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| You'll notice I did not name the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| We were told to keep student identity strictly confidential, so we never, ever put a student's name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| They're identified by emergent, proficient, and advanced, and point A and then point B later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| So this student was trying to do this math concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| Does anyone need me to explain this math concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Then let's go to point B, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| Can I just ask you really quickly, Natasha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| When was that evidence collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| Because I think that shows, for me, just the whole process itself is developmentally inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| and has no, you know, if you have a student that's emerging, that's going to be normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| to have kids walk in your kindergarten classroom that don't know all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| And so I think the amount of time that you're showing us that this takes to present some evidence to a mythical person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5897)|
| 1:38:25| that I don't actually, I'll get to that in a minute, believe scored all of these portfolios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| is a disservice to the children when you could be spending your time focusing your instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| and tailoring your instruction to what their specific needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| I mean, it just, it's crazy to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| It is an absolute disservice to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| We are spending an inordinate amount of time gathering and collecting data so that we look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| I mean, the bottom line is I want a five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| I want to show that I'm a good teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| So, yes, we spend a lot of time gathering and collecting data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| I asked when...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Okay, so it starts...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Point A and point B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| You asked when it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| I'm not going to start it tomorrow, but the next time they come in, I'm going to have to take a stab in the dark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| as to what the State Department of Education wants to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| And I'm going to start collecting all kinds of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| I'm going to collect data on counting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I'm going to collect data on adding and subtracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| I'm going to collect data on writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| And I'm going to do that as soon as I can because the sooner I can gather that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| then I can work like a busy beaver and my children can work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| And then in March or February, when I go and get that point B, then I will be getting more data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| so that I have a large range that shows that I took these children that couldn't hold a pencil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5989)|
| 1:39:57| and now they're holding a pencil and they're struggling to write a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| Yeah, and I'll just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| The only other thing I'll add is there is some research being done that looks at the fact that this type of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| and procedure is harmful to kids' self-efficacy and success in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| because what we're seeing is that from qualitative data from kindergarten teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| where this has been in place in other states, for example, there was a study in Michigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| that the teachers reported seeing a decrease in their students' self-efficacy and autonomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6024)|
| 1:40:31| because the teachers are required to collect so much of this data for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| that maybe have never been in a formal educational setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| And so they begin to think and believe that they fail before they've even had an opportunity to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Okay, so now what you're looking at is the point B of that emergent student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| And you'll, again, see my name but no score beside it that shows that a peer reviewer scored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6054)|
| 1:41:02| You'll see that I received a five because my student grew from not knowing how to do this skill at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| to now being quite effective at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Now let's look at the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| Again, there's the context form that justifies why I gave the student the score that I gave the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6076)|
| 1:41:24| And that took at least 24 hours of my at-home personal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6084)|
| 1:41:29| So I essentially robbed my family of myself, and I didn't get to spend that time with my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6089)|
| 1:41:37| Let's go to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| So as you can see, it's considerably harder, and that student did quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| They missed one, but that still was an acceptable number to miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| Does anyone have any questions on that slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6118)|
| 1:42:07| So it was explained that when the State Department came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| they said that one could have been because it was two different types of forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| She didn't use the same form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| But another kindergarten teacher, because I spoke with Dr. Drummond that was going to kill me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| that I've been talking with kindergarten teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| Well, a kindergarten teacher had something similar to this, had the same documents, and still scored a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| So that's what's challenging about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| I think it might be helpful, if you're still awake and with me, to look at where I scored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| where I got scored, and where I had a peer reviewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| We're not going to go and look at the proficient and advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| It's basically the same kind of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| But I think it will help you to understand this process if you see one that was scored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| So can you get me to my accounting and cardinality, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6179)|
| 1:43:11| While they're looking that up, I'll just add, from my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| there was a person that was a peer reviewer that reviewed some of the portfolios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6197)|
| 1:43:24| They reviewed their portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| They asked the state, you know, they completed what they were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| They asked for more to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| And they were told no, which I found strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| And then the person was subsequently told later, and this is a teacher in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| that they had not reviewed enough portfolios to get the stipend that the peer reviewers were being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| So I have some real concerns about, I guess the truth is relevant for our Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6227)|
| 1:43:56| Before you go, Natasha, I think the other night, which I have studied and thought about for days now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| we were told that some of the problems with the teachers were that they mismatched students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6242)|
| 1:44:10| And I just don't believe that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| But I don't even understand beyond that how you could determine that you've mismatched a student if students aren't identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6252)|
| 1:44:20| How would the state know that it was a mismatched student if there's no identification for the students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6260)|
| 1:44:28| And then another question that I had was, if you're going to show growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| you can't just hand that student that first paper you did at the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| I mean, if this student's advanced to the paper you just showed us, and you're trying to show growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| why would you limit it to that first paper you introduced the first day they were in kindergarten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6285)|
| 1:44:52| So mismatching, I would think, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| I just think you would have to use a different thing to show true growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| or you're limiting how much they grew in your evidence collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| So now we're actually going to look at a, I was going to have you look at my math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| but my colleague has said that we're going to look at my language arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| and this might be a good thing because then you can see how developmentally inappropriate this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| Okay, so now we're looking at the language arts scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| and you can see there is someone that has rated my portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| You see the PR, which means peer reviewer, and you see the NP, which of course stands for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| If you could slide that down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6343)|
| 1:45:49| So I picked option C, and you can see my score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| You can see the peer reviewer's score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| And then you can see, I guess, what would be our average of that score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6357)|
| 1:46:06| Oh, I know why there's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| There are three different circles filled in there because I had to cover in one portfolio collection three different objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6368)|
| 1:46:20| and it was grueling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Does anyone have questions on this part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| So when we're looking at the PR there, I assume that's primary rater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| None of your others had that rater or that number, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| So the one that you had a five and the one that you had a one, neither one shows a rater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| Okay, now I think we should look at the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| And again, I believe this is an emergent student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| Okay, so you can see my context form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| And I had to describe each of the three standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6417)|
| 1:47:04| And if you slide it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| Okay, so here is where I now justify my score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| And teachers struggled over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I remember having several conversations over the phone late at night with peers saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| well, how are we going to score this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Because the rubric says one thing, but it didn't align up with how our kids were working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6439)|
| 1:47:27| And if we had time, we could look through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| But, you know, the time is getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| So I think we should move on to look at the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| I'd like to point out to the board, too, that there's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6456)|
| 1:47:52| Debbie, go to first tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Go to more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| Go down, down, down, down, down, down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| Bam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| There's no way that I or any of us could have run her slideshow while she's talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| Because it is unwieldy to go from screen to screen and figure out where all of the information is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| The platform is incredibly difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| Thankfully, thankfully we have an expert back here who has also done the portfolio who is also willing to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| And I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Thank you, Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| So Debbie can get through this because she has spent a year digging through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| It's amazingly, ridiculously difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6522)|
| 1:48:47| And I hope everyone is seeing the back and forth and back and forth that a teacher has to do to even look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| and see that the standard and the explanation and the student work all lines up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| And notice that all of these have, whether the State Department agrees or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6542)|
| 1:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| So this is my emerging student at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| I asked them to draw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| Well, I read them a story first, an informational story that gave facts about space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| And I asked them to draw a picture and write any words they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| Well, they couldn't write any words, but they said, hey, I've drawn a sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| And so I wrote the word sun in the middle of that evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Now, if you look to the right-hand side, you see level one criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| And that states why it's a level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| And if Debbie goes down further, you get my feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| My feedback on this is student wrote no words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| That's the feedback that I got, even though I had to combine three objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6593)|
| 1:50:02| And now let's close this and go look at this same emergent student later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6602)|
| 1:50:26| Slide it down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6626)|
| 1:50:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| So you'll see that I gave myself a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| My peer reviewer gave me a three on the applies student knowledge of phonics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6640)|
| 1:50:49| That's how well they can write words in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| And then I got a five, or I gave myself a five, and the peer reviewer gave me a five on the objective or standard of can the student identify the main topic and retell something about that main topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6652)|
| 1:51:07| And then I got a four on uses combination of drawing and dictation and writing to describe the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6667)|
| 1:51:16| Now I'll tell you, one of the reasons I got a four is my students did not write a concluding sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| Yes, in kindergarten, they were expected to write a concluding sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| Here is my context form, which describes and justifies why I gave the scores that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6689)|
| 1:51:41| Now, this is what the student was able to do after a lot of pain and a lot of work and a lot of inappropriate time spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6701)|
| 1:51:58| Some of the words I gave them, there was not really any way they could spell star because star has an R-controlled vowel and they haven't got there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6718)|
| 1:52:07| They didn't know how to spell the word when because when has an H in it and kindergarteners don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| If you look at the word explode at the very last word, they spelled it with an X and they used appropriate letter sound relationships to finish the word explode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6734)|
| 1:52:27| However, there were certain kinds of words that I had to have to get a score of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| And I didn't have those mainly because they didn't apply themselves to that particular story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| I would have had to say, hey, honey, why don't you write the word was in there and that will get me some bonus points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| But that really doesn't make sense for a child to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| Because you have to have CVCs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| You have to have consonant, vowel, consonant, vowel, consonant, consonant, vowel, vowel blends, consonant blends, and maybe a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6771)|
| 1:53:06| But I'd have to have the whole rubric there because it's overwhelming to me and it is to children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| Now, you'll see that I got a comment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| The student has topic and three details for a level four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| Debbie, can you slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| And if you look over on the left-hand side, you can see little blue arrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6802)|
| 1:53:29| So if she touches each of those blue arrows, a different comment will show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Now, if you think back to the score that I got a one and there was no peer reviewer, there are also no comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6814)|
| 1:53:43| Because I don't believe they looked at my portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| Why would you give me a score of one and not make some comment as to why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6827)|
| 1:53:55| I think I have thoroughly explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| I hope I have thoroughly explained this to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| If you would like to see more, I'm more than willing to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| But do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| I don't see any, Natasha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| And I think everybody's turned off their lights for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| So we'll go back to Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| She asked to make a couple of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| But I appreciate you being so transparent, and I appreciate the board's indulgence in letting her show you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6859)|
| 1:54:27| But I do think it's important to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| It's one thing to hear, well, such and such percent didn't score a one, but all these others scored three, fours, and fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| But it has been, and I appreciate all the work you've done, too, Ms. Owen, on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| But we have got to address this issue at multiple levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| So thank you very much for being willing to come tonight, Natasha, and all the kindergarten teachers that came in support of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| Oh, Carrie, your light's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Your light's on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Ms. Owen, can you let Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| Thank you, Natasha, and thank you, Debbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Madam Chair, besides the misscoring, the whole concept is beyond reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6908)|
| 1:55:19| I have no appropriate words for this because there are no appropriate words for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| Nothing's appropriate about the situation our Department of Education has repeatedly put teachers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6924)|
| 1:55:32| So I would like to call on our Director of Schools and this Board to let our legislators, the Department of Education, and our Governor know that we have no confidence in this portfolio process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6932)|
| 1:55:42| in the TIN-Ready testing, or in our State Department of Education as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6949)|
| 1:55:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| Ms. Heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Thank you, Natasha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| I don't disagree with anything that has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6957)|
| 1:56:03| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| So now we're, okay, what can we do about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| You know, as I've had to painfully tell the kindergarten teachers I've seen these last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| and I have been in probably six of my schools in the last three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| and not one that's got kindergarten in it hasn't been bombarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| But that's a good thing because we need to be educated to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| So that's a very good thing that this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| I need to apologize to Dr. Drummond not giving you more heads up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| I just got the copy of Pat Mashburn's e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7007)|
| 1:56:55| and the copy from Michael Shepard with the professional educators of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7015)|
| 1:57:04| Am I correct that's the other union that represents Tennessee or, I mean, represents educators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7024)|
| 1:57:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7038)|
| 1:57:23| Dr. Drummond, the letter from or the e-mail from Ms. Mashburn, how are you, Pat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7043)|
| 1:57:37| I know you guys have been dying on this, too, and I know, too, that this wasn't an issue that you created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| Let me just say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| You, in many ways, are about as victimized as everybody else is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| because none of us here made this happen or wanted this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7071)|
| 1:57:59| If I could just read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| And let me ask you, did this go out to all kindergarten teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7081)|
| 1:58:08| If I could, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| Thank you, Ms. Mashburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7091)|
| 1:58:21| Friday of last week, August 3rd, Darlene Miller made a phone call to Keely Potter at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7101)|
| 1:58:30| who's in charge of portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| And our response was we had all these concerns from the kindergarten and other early grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7113)|
| 1:58:42| and their response was you can waive the local grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| And 14 people had already filed a local grievance about their scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| and they sent a form called a portfolio submission error notification process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| So we attached that, and I personally sent an email out to each kindergarten person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7140)|
| 1:59:07| who had filed a local grievance with this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| So this state information allows them to directly respond to the state what their concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7151)|
| 1:59:20| about their portfolio submission, if there's an error at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| filing for a local grievance because the local folks in Knox County did not score their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| And I think had we had this on the upswing, we had to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| And probably it had not been created until when we asked for it late Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| This was not to our knowledge until Darlene called and they sent us this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| So I attach this to every person who had filed a grievance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| She sent it out to every person on her listserv that she supervises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| They should have gotten that information Friday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| They who should have gotten that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| I'm talking about your early grades folks, all your pre-K and K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7211)|
| 2:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| From Darlene, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| From Ms. Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| The teachers should have gotten it directly if they were one of the 14 that had already filed a grievance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| Just everyone in those grade levels received this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7231)|
| 2:00:37| Received the information that I'm looking at from the email that you sent Tuesday afternoon to this one particular teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7237)|
| 2:00:47| And I sent it to the 14 people who had filed a grievance to make sure they got the same information one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| I didn't want any oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| Natasha, did you have a comment about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| I did get that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| The problem being is that when I read through that, it still claims, wants to claim that I am at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| I am not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| I'm not going to say, I'm not going to lie and say, yep, I made a mistake when I did not make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Now this information from this Michael Shepard, which according to Dr. Drummond, you had not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7283)|
| 2:01:31| So we don't even know if this is correct about a technical error you got until October 1st when you get your school scores to make your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7291)|
| 2:01:45| You have until October 1st to file this new form according to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7305)|
| 2:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7313)|
| 2:01:54| It says if you wish no later than October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| You can file by October 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| So it looks like this letter from Michael Shepard is stating, though, is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7327)|
| 2:02:16| That if they want to add a letter to it stating that they're one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| And if this form doesn't allow you to do that, I would recommend that they contact Keeley-Potter directly via e-mail at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7342)|
| 2:02:33| If the form that —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| If they can't submit what they wish to submit to be looked at, then I would recommend that they e-mail Keeley-Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7354)|
| 2:02:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| So is the statement, to your knowledge, because I know you're getting some of this just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7365)|
| 2:02:55| If you wish to keep your portfolio scores but would like documentation added to your record stating that the ones you received were due to a technical error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7375)|
| 2:03:06| versus a determination of lack of growth, you may request that the notification letter you received from the state DOE be added to your evaluation file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7386)|
| 2:03:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| I can't speak for what his source is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| But this whole thing speaks to the total mass confusion that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7407)|
| 2:03:37| So do you have a — you do not know that —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| Point of order, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| We have been talking about this for going on an hour now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| It is abundantly clear this is an absolute absurdity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| We have been talking about evaluations in general since TVAS came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7435)|
| 2:04:01| And we keep railing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| We keep railing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| We can beat the details of this thing to death all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| It's absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| It's completely absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| It's driving teachers crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| And this isn't — I want us to get to a point where we're doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7456)|
| 2:04:22| And that's what I'm trying to do here, is trying to determine, in fact, what is the most recent information that our kindergarten teachers have even been sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7462)|
| 2:04:33| Because clearly I'm looking at things here that teachers, kindergarten teachers, they're shaking their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| They don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| So I am trying to look for commonality, because you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| It's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7485)|
| 2:04:46| It's horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| Well, let me just add this to the mess, because I talked with Representative Smith last night after he had spent all day in the summer study grilling the DOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7487)|
| 2:04:59| and here's two bits of information that probably you all don't have that I have that I want to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7499)|
| 2:05:06| These are — and by far, by all means, it is not sufficient, but there is an attempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7506)|
| 2:05:13| These were all the things we got the department to agree to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| One, any portfolio with an automatic one can submit proof that no standards are mismatched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7517)|
| 2:05:24| and the DOE will rescore the portfolio and update a teacher evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7524)|
| 2:05:32| Two, additionally, any teacher that would have been tenure eligible but this year's score would make them ineligible can ignore this year's score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7532)|
| 2:05:42| and the next score can be used as their third year to grain tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| So, again, to your point, and to your point, we just — this just keeps rolling along while these teachers out here have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7547)|
| 2:05:57| They're starting a new year with 20 students that don't know how to go to the bathroom or tie their shoes, and they're dealing with all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7557)|
| 2:06:05| And then the State Department — thank you, Mr. Norman, for your charge on all of this — is now decided to do a new portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7565)|
| 2:06:14| and they have to learn how to upload all of that evidence again on a new platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| I mean, I don't know what else we can say, and that's to your point, Mr. Norman, that we've been talking about this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7579)|
| 2:06:27| So, we'll let Ms. Hill finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7587)|
| 2:06:29| Jennifer, your light's back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| Yeah, I just want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Okay, and then Ms. —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| One more question, and I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| And then Ms. Dethridge has a question, and then you've got two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| Ms. Owen, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Go, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7605)|
| 2:06:46| So, you teachers, if I may, that are sitting out here, were you aware of what Ms. Bowne said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7606)|
| 2:06:53| Did you know that that had been determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| I see some —| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Our latest email was explaining about the new platform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| and that's the only type of direction that's been given as of recent for this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| Okay, but I'm talking about the comment about last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| We had received your Jefferson email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| You did receive this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7639)|
| 2:07:27| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7647)|
| 2:07:28| From Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| Ms. Coatney, if you're going to speak directly, which I'm not sure what that rules are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7650)|
| 2:07:37| then she's going to have to have names to go into the record of the teachers that are answering your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7663)|
| 2:07:44| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| I'm finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| So, Ms. Dethridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| Your poor microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| I turned you off, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| We're ready to do board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| My question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| Remember when we were in Nashville and you were with the kindergarten teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and this was the discussion for this portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| Is this the same thing that we've been complaining about for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| and we're still having teachers that go to Nashville to discuss this same portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| Because I remember when you were there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| Well, what happened was we piloted it and then the DOE put their spin on it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| And so while technically it is the portfolio that was voted on by the legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| what caused a lot of these problems, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| was that they did not use Knox County's that was teacher-driven, teacher-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| that was developed by us as a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| It was sent to the Department of Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| They compressed objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7726)|
| 2:08:47| They made it super rigorous, totally developmentally inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| which is why they said they'll go back this year and redo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| And then they changed the way it's uploaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7735)|
| 2:09:00| So you're right to some extent, except the DOE messed with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| and they've created this huge fiasco throughout the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| When we respond according to what I guess Jennifer is going to request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7749)|
| 2:09:16| we need to go back and respond to what we submitted the first time that was teacher-driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7756)|
| 2:09:21| and try to go from there and get them to look at what we did the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| and use that as a way of changing the portfolio to better fit what is best for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7767)|
| 2:09:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| Ms. Owen, can you wrap this up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7777)|
| 2:09:38| In two sentences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7779)|
| 2:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| I'd like to make a motion for our chair and our director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| to draft a strong letter to our legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| our Department of Education and the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| expressing that we have no confidence in the portfolio process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| the TIN-Ready test, or our Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| and to follow the intent of the recent letter that was drafted by the superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| in Shelby County and Metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| to say that they believed that a pause needed to be placed on the TIN-Ready test specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7808)|
| 2:10:17| but I would add to it a portfolio process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| and just pause until we have a new governor in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| who can find a way to get a handle on our Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| However that needs to be said in your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| And for you guys to draft that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| Would you read?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen, seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| Maybe you just repeat it, seconded by Ms. Roundtree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| and then we'll have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Maybe I'll read out the intent part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| A motion for our chair and our director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| to draft a strong letter to our legislative delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| our Department of Education, and our governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| expressing that we have no confidence in the portfolio process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| the TIN-Ready test, or our entire Tennessee Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7859)|
| 2:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| Now we've got more lights on, so I think it was Ms. Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7866)|
| 2:11:10| then Ms. Etheridge, and then you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| Oh, Amber seconded it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| So we have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| and Ms. Fugate can speak in discussion and then Mr. Norman before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| My only, I guess, point of order question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| I think it would be wise for the board to see the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7888)|
| 2:11:32| and vote to approve to send that letter as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7892)|
| 2:11:38| just so that it's on the record that the board actually saw the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| and agreed to all the language in the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| We do that with every other resolution we've ever sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| So I don't have a problem with her suggesting that you draft a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| but I think before it goes it should come back before the board to be voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| because that's the way we've done those kind of things before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| Okay. Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| And then I would ask the maker of the motion for a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| to include the team evaluation system in general in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7928)|
| 2:12:20| Are you referring to T. Voss or team? Team and team? Okay, team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| Okay, that is a friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Ms., I guess it's back to you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| Will that amendment be, if that's acceptable to the board, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7953)|
| 2:12:41| You decide, and then I have to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| It's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Do you want to accept it? Then Ms. Rountree has to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| Do we all need to sign the letter, too? I'd be fine with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| Okay, so you're accepting the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7973)|
| 2:12:58| You're seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7978)|
| 2:12:59| Yes, I'm seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7979)|
| 2:13:00| Now we're back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7980)|
| 2:13:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Now we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Now we're voting on us drafting the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7984)|
| 2:13:10| Do we need another motion because we heard Ms. Fuga's comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7990)|
| 2:13:17| Or just Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=7997)|
| 2:13:20| Do we need to be specific as to Ms. Coatney send it out and get board approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8000)|
| 2:13:27| get each member's, or does that need to be a public record open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8007)|
| 2:13:32| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| I think that Ms. Owen has, to my understanding, accepted the two friendly amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8014)|
| 2:13:40| one for the team rubric and one to make this a draft to be approved by all board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8020)|
| 2:13:49| Is that correct, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| I don't think that was Ms. Fugate's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| It was made in the form of a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| My understanding was just that we need to approve it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I did not make a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Ms. Coatney said that protocol is that we typically don't let the board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| and superintendent draft a letter on behalf of the board without it coming back to the board for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| I think that's risky water to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| So that was more of a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| I think I can support voting on a motion to tell them to draft something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8057)|
| 2:14:24| I guess my friendly amendment is that they not send it prior to the board approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| Do we need to meet to approve it, or can we approve it individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| I think as a matter of sunshine, it should probably be in public, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8074)|
| 2:14:39| So we would need to have a special call meeting just for that or wait until the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| Do it in September and let the new people vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| Do it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| But that's kind of time-sensitive since Nashville and Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| So I don't know if we need—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| Ms. Hill, do you have a comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| I'm wondering at this point, it might not be more timely to see if we could not get the board to approve a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8105)|
| 2:15:19| to send a letter merely stating that we are—to the effect we are strongly opposed to this portfolio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8119)|
| 2:15:30| to the results, that it needs to be—hold harmless, it needs to have a pause on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8130)|
| 2:15:40| whatever we want to throw in at this point, isolate it to this most immediate and timely concern, which is the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8140)|
| 2:15:51| And then perhaps at our next meeting we could consider something else that includes some of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| that Ms. Owens originally stated because this is so time-sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8157)|
| 2:16:05| I guess that would go back to Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| I hear what you're saying, but we still have the problem with setting protocol for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8168)|
| 2:16:15| Now, we directed the superintendent to write a strong letter, which none of the board had any problem with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8175)|
| 2:16:24| In this case, Ms. Owens is asking that it be the board included in that, which I think sends a stronger statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8184)|
| 2:16:33| But to Ms. Fugate's point, we need—I mean, I don't mind calling a special called meeting and coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8193)|
| 2:16:41| but I don't know how the rest of the board feels about coming back to read a letter tomorrow or the next day and sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| So, I don't know. That's the board's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| I'm retired. I can come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8211)|
| 2:16:56| Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| Thank you again. I am really not trying to make this difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| I'm just saying you are setting a precedent that if a letter goes out under the authority of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| without the board voting to approve that letter, that's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| I have no problem with a called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| I'm the elected representative until the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I can come back, but I think everything that was in that motion makes it a little more likely that we might not all agree with everything in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8237)|
| 2:17:31| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| Ms. Fugate's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| If you're calling for a letter and you don't have the exact wording at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| the board will have to have some type of meeting, presumably a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| which would have to have at least two days' notice and then agree on the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8268)|
| 2:17:54| Alternatively, the motion could be amended or substituted to do what Ms. Hill suggests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8274)|
| 2:18:03| which is just simply send a sentence or two to the state board and then do something at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8283)|
| 2:18:14| Okay, thank you. I guess we'll let Ms. Horn speak to this and then Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| I think a more focused letter, as Ms. Hill has suggested, would be beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| because I think when you pile on too many things, it's ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| So I think if we want to make a statement on the kindergarten portfolio that it should be targeted to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8310)|
| 2:18:36| and if we want to entertain other broader issues later on down the road, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| But I think that it carries more weight if it's focused and not all over the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| because when you make blanket statements that are not focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| I don't think that it will be received with as much credibility, thank you, Ms. Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8331)|
| 2:19:01| than it would if it's focused on one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| Okay, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| Yeah, and I agree. I can see this could get too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| So the important point is the portfolio. That's important right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| And so I'll withdraw that part of the friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8354)|
| 2:19:19| but I would like to see the whole evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8359)|
| 2:19:25| That's the source of the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8365)|
| 2:19:29| The portfolio is born out of the whole mess of the evaluation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| So that's what we need to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| Okay. I see no lights on, but we need Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| Do you want to make a substitute motion after hearing your colleagues speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| and zeroing in on the portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| I included the TINREADY test because Shelby County and Metro Nashville had already strongly opposed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8396)|
| 2:20:05| and they had specifically said they have no confidence in TINREADY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| I could take out TINREADY if we need to and do that separately some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8409)|
| 2:20:17| I do want to include our Department of Education. I think that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| I think that's where the failure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8422)|
| 2:20:25| Really, we don't even have to say portfolio because every one of these huge fiascos that we have experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8425)|
| 2:20:33| that has impacted our teachers, that's impacted our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| that's impacted our ability to have class and to learn has been a direct result of a failure of the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8436)|
| 2:20:48| So that, I believe, needs to urgently be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| So if I need to restate the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| I can say that it is a motion for our chair and the superintendent to draft a strong letter to our legislative delegates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| our Department of Education, and our governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| expressing that we have no confidence in the portfolio process or our Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8464)|
| 2:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Mr. Dubler, if it just states the motion primarily, is there the same slippery slope that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8476)|
| 2:21:25| If it's just what's in the motion that we send and the board agrees to, is that satisfactory, Ms. Fugate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8485)|
| 2:21:32| I'm thinking it will need some introduction and, you know, I'm not thinking that they're going to come out with a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| Mr. Dubler, if they drafted this into a formal letter and each board member saw that letter without discussion or change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8498)|
| 2:21:52| and they had no objection, could it be sent that way or would we still have to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| I think we still need a special call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| I'll let him roll, but I think we need a special call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8521)|
| 2:22:04| Yes, Ms. Elwin, yeah, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| I mean, there would still be some type of deliberation there, which would have to be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| So if you're looking at today as Wednesday, having it ready by Friday, then a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| In that case, throw in some more mean words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| So I'm sorry, I was listening to Ms. Tubbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| I'm sorry, I was saying throw in some more angry words if we have a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8551)|
| 2:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| So what is the will of this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| Your motion, as you stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| I guess we could go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| I don't see any other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| I second the new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| So Ms. Hill seconded Ms. Elwin's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| I don't think you can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| Can I hear it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| I move for our chair and the superintendent to draft a strong letter to our legislative delegation, our Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8582)|
| 2:23:07| and the governor expressing that we have no confidence in the portfolio process or our Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8587)|
| 2:23:17| Was that a substitute or an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| If I'm supposed to second, I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| I think she withdrew her motion, made a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| Oh, did you withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| Just let's call it that that's what she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| And you're seconding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| Ms. Hill seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| Ms. Hill seconded it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| Is pre-K also doing this portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| So we need to be sure that we say the pre-K through K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| Actually, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| You all made this an impossible night for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| I'll do not put your light on me speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| All opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| All opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8646)|
| 2:24:07| Not unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| Ms. Fugate voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| May I explain why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8649)|
| 2:24:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| I just can't throw a whole Department of Education under the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| That's like throwing all of Knox County schools under the bus when there's part of what they do we don't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8661)|
| 2:24:22| That's a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8662)|
| 2:24:25| And we do have a newly, well, we will have a newly elected governor who has, the ones I've talked to, hope to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8665)|
| 2:24:34| So there's always hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8674)|
| 2:24:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8676)|
| 2:24:37| I think that's it except for board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| There's no public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| So, Ms. Roundtree, Ms. Detheridge, we'll start over there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| Do you have anything for board forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| Just to say thank you for honoring me and my family and the service I provided because I provided because of the love I have for the kids and education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8690)|
| 2:25:02| And I appreciate everyone that has supported us or supported me for the eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8702)|
| 2:25:08| And I appreciate everything Knox County does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| We do have things that we need to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| I know there's a lot of things and challenges and I don't plan to go away, but I do plan to support this board and support Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8713)|
| 2:25:21| But I just want to tell you how much I really appreciate everybody that take the time out to do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8721)|
| 2:25:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Ms. Olin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Do we need to set a time to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| Ms. Dupler mentioned that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| I don't know that anybody has their calendars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| Do you all want to set a time right now or would you rather send in or have Terry send out a time and you all agree to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8738)|
| 2:25:49| Yeah, the time does not have to be decided right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| But, I mean, through Ms. Coatney, I mean, the board can come up with a time and then public notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8752)|
| 2:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| So we'll just direct Ms. Coatney to come up with a time allowing for the two days public notice, time for the superintendent to get it together and do it as soon as possible after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8759)|
| 2:26:10| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| Is that okay with everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8772)|
| 2:26:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8773)|
| 2:26:14| So, Ms. Olin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8774)|
| 2:26:15| And I'd like to say that I appreciate those who are outgoing from our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| It has been a lot of difficult work and many trying times on both sides of the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8780)|
| 2:26:28| So all of that time, I know there were several years ago some five-hour meetings over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8788)|
| 2:26:37| And you put in many, many, many long, long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| And we appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8805)|
| 2:26:46| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Thanks, Gloria and Amber and Ms. Fugate for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| It truly is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8813)|
| 2:26:54| It's a much bigger job than what people realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| You know, you sort of say, well, you're on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| Oh, well, they have no idea how much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| And we've been castigated a couple of times for how much we're paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8823)|
| 2:27:08| I mean, my gosh, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| So, anyway, and thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| And God bless all our students and teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| I hope this is the smartest and safest year we've ever had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8837)|
| 2:27:22| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8842)|
| 2:27:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| Ms. Rountree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8845)|
| 2:27:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| There are too many people for me to thank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| But I would be remiss if I didn't say just thank you to everyone who has helped lift me up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| and my family up along this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| I'm sure most of you remember I started when I was pregnant with Teddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| and you saw him here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| And both of my boys have been through many board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| and spent many nights at home with my husband, Bart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8870)|
| 2:27:54| So I would be very remiss if I didn't thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8874)|
| 2:27:57| I know he left, but he is super dad and super husband,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| and he's really made this work of serving the community possible for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| And I've enjoyed the time I've put in, and if you haven't seen the last of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| I'm going to keep working and fighting for literacy and what's best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| And you'll probably see me on the other side of the podium as a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| I appreciate all the work that has been done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| and I look forward to seeing great things to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| Ms. Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| I would just say that as the daughter and granddaughter of educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| and I'm the first generation in my family not to become an educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| I have a great respect for the work people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| I don't have the patience to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| and I admire those of you who have the willingness to serve children in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8920)|
| 2:28:46| What I have hoped to do over the last eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| is bring what I thought were my gifts and talents to help improve education for students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8929)|
| 2:28:56| I've been active in schools for 21 years since my now 26-year-old showed up at elementary school and kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8936)|
| 2:29:06| and it's been an interesting and wild ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| What I will say that I hope happens more than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| and I have disagreed with colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| but I hope what the community learns and what our country needs desperately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| is for people to understand that people can be colleagues and have different points of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8962)|
| 2:29:28| and when we share those points of view, we actually inform one another's decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8968)|
| 2:29:33| and become a better community and a better board and a better country from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| The vitriol that is around so much and that some of us have experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| some of us have given to one another in the past, I really appreciate how that has tamped down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8985)|
| 2:29:51| and I have become a better board member by listening to people that I didn't always agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| I hope I have helped shape opinions of people who didn't always agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| and I would just hope that the board continues to do that work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| and I cannot leave without saying a tremendous thank you to the central office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| For the eight years that I have served on the board, what is asked of you is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9011)|
| 2:30:18| We talk a lot about what's asked of our teachers, but people don't see what's asked of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9018)|
| 2:30:24| and the amount of work you do, I'd say 100-hour weeks is the norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9024)|
| 2:30:31| and that's when school's not in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| and I just, the professionalism and the commitment and the absolute love for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9034)|
| 2:30:43| and making their lives better is why you do what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| and I am forever grateful for having gotten to work with all of you and wish you much continued success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9046)|
| 2:30:54| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| I just want to join with just wishing you all the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9057)|
| 2:31:03| and I've enjoyed getting to know each one of you, and I've learned a lot from each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| and thank you for making me feel welcome two years ago when I came onto the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9068)|
| 2:31:14| and I appreciate your service, and Tony's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9074)|
| 2:31:19| People don't realize the time that we all put into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9079)|
| 2:31:23| and that even when we disagree, we all want the best for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| We just have different perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| and so I'm glad that we've had the opportunity to learn from one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9089)|
| 2:31:34| and I wish you all the best, and thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| We're coming to GSBA for fun now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9100)|

| 2:31:50| A long time, so kudos to you for making it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9110)|
| 2:31:58| Gloria and Amber and Lynn, best to you, and I do hope we see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| It's been good making new friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| Yes, Ms. Horne, eight years is quite a while for some of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| and, well, hopefully more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| I do want to say that, of course, Amber, you've only been here four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9140)|
| 2:32:25| but I think you've accomplished quite a bit in those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9145)|
| 2:32:29| You've been very, very involved, and I appreciate all that you have done, all your contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9149)|
| 2:32:40| Sometimes we've not always agreed on things, but that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9160)|
| 2:32:45| That brings me to Gloria and Lynn, and I all came in together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| and I think over the years and over time, we've gotten to know each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9171)|
| 2:33:03| and, as Lynn said, appreciate the other one's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9183)|
| 2:33:09| You can agree to disagree, and I think that's what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9189)|
| 2:33:16| I do think that all of you, I sort of mentioned it when I was talking about Amber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9196)|
| 2:33:23| but I think Gloria and Lynn have made major contributions in your time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9203)|
| 2:33:31| You've had a little bit longer than Amber has had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9211)|
| 2:33:36| but I do appreciate the things that you brought to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9216)|
| 2:33:43| and I've enjoyed working with you, and to be honest, I'll miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| And, you know, I meant to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| Has everybody had a chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| Did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| I started with Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| Did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| On behalf of the students of Knox County, thank the three of you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9242)|
| 2:34:05| I know it means a lot to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| I meant to say this when I came back up here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| after I read that litany of everything you all had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9251)|
| 2:34:14| We have a lot of committees on the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9254)|
| 2:34:18| I started reading through those, and I thought, oh, my goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| which is additional time served when Tony mentions about how long it takes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| I mean, how much work it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| but there's all those committees that you serve on in addition to the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9268)|
| 2:34:33| and the schools and the phone calls and the e-mails and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| So all three of you are going to be missed very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| and we just look forward to seeing you in the future and good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| And if I miss you to go out to dinner and not sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| If I have a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| Adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9295)|

| 2:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| Hey, other than the call meeting to vote on a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9307)|
| 2:35:10| there's nothing else for me to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| So I have a motion, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchBrdR603180809Aug08?start=9314)|
