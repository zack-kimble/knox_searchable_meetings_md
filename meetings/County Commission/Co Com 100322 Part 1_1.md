| 2:14:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| There was a, as I was reading the ordinance, there was a thing there about some election studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| What studies were you referring to on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Well, that was something that the law director, I don't know if you had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| I was just wondering because I'd like to see those studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| I don't have them in front of me, Commissioner, but I did just a nationwide search on some of the problematic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8091)|
| 2:15:00| that face school boards and that seemed to be one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| But I'll find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| That was the question I had on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:17| I guess I'll keep kind of coming back to the question of why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:31| I don't see a lot of evidence that this will make our system better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:39| And, you know, I heard the argument of someone voting, living a mile away from their voting precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:48| and they don't have a say in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| I guess I disagree because they live in a district and they have a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8151)|
| 2:16:02| I mean, I think every county resident is part of a district, part of a school board district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8162)|
| 2:16:07| and they have an equal say regardless of proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| My district doesn't go as far as most, but it's a fairly large district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| And I think a person at one end of that district that may be closer to Commissioner Brown's district, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:24| may be on a stone's throw away from Commissioner Armstrong and his district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:34| has as much say as someone in the heart of it, the center of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| I just think that this is overly burdensome to the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| They don't have to come down and speak to it unless they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:50| I don't see the value added in going on with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8210)|
| 2:16:58| And I guess I'm asking what's broken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| What requires an ordinance that's so badly broken with our process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:10| I think our Election Commission, they're holding the cost down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| They're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| From what I've heard them speak up here, I don't think they're overly excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| So I just, again, I want to hear what other folks have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:34| But at this point, I just don't see where this is going to give any value to where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| and what we're doing presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Do you want to respond to Commissioner Luthor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| I never said it was broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| I just felt like this move would make it even better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| When I take a look at the voting process, I guess I'm a little more old-fashioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8273)|
| 2:18:00| I take a look at a voting precinct and I take a look at that as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:08| And if a community gets to be able to speak as one, then I think they speak with a stronger voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8288)|
| 2:18:16| As far as confusion, if the Election Commissioner would like to speak, he's welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8296)|
| 2:18:22| But this doesn't place a burden on them as long as the, you know, because county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:32| we have to by state law, we have to have districts that have whole precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:42| We are not allowed as a commission to have a voting precinct split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:50| This doesn't place any additional burden on the school board or the election commission that I could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:59| And I just think it's a way to make the process better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| I've had people come up to me, because I work the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| I stand out front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| And I've had the people come up to me and they're confused why they're standing in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| that they got to vote for or they didn't get to vote for school board that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:22| whereas someone they were standing in line with did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| And that's sometimes confusing for the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| And then it has to be explained if they had bothered to ask someone to get it explained to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:39| So I'm not trying to say it's broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| I'm just trying to make the process better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| Can I speak to Mr. McKenzie's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| You know, I like the idea for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:54| There's a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| You know, in my district, I have Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| Powell High School is represented by until the grandfathering goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| And there's three school board representatives that represent Powell High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| And then I go over into Amherst and Hardin Valley and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8411)|
| 2:20:18| So I have four school board members in my district that I have to try to work with or talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:27| or if it's a Powell High School problem, it's a different board member from Carnes to Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:34| which is two miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| And so, I mean, to me it would make it more simple if the voter came to the voting booth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:44| and said, okay, I'm voting for district 6 commissioner and I'm voting for district 6 school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:50| I just think it's a more simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| Instead, now they have to call 3, 4, and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| And I think it just makes it more simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:58| People understand, hey, I'm in county district number 6 and that's who I'm voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:04| And so I have to keep up or to consult with four different school board members within my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8464)|
| 2:21:11| And I think to be more compact and contiguous, it would make them more like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| in the fact that they would be connected simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:24| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| My only concern was Baker versus Carr, an early 1960s Supreme Court decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:35| requiring that electoral districts be as equal as mathematically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:42| And I suppose as long as we make it a part of the official record that there's no intent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| to subvert that principle, that very important principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| And maybe my statement here and maybe Craig's statement to that effect would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| I just want to make sure that it's on the record that we have no intent to support that equal voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| no dilution of one person's vote principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| And as long as that's part of it, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| And they would be following the exact same process that county commission has to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:17| which includes following that particular court order along with all federal and state laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:24| as far as being compact and contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| And they have to be within a certain range, plus or minus certain percentage points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8547)|
| 2:22:33| And this does not address that, not in the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| It just simply means that it reiterates that they be compact and contiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:48| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| Well, in regards to what Commissioner Harmon just said, it seems to me that before we act on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:58| we might want to see what the actual effect will be in moving the districts around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| and perhaps, I mean, I've got the same situation that Commissioner Andrews has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| with several different school board members that have schools within my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:19| So I'd kind of like to know what will the effect be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| and I don't know that we can answer that until the election commission can tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| or perhaps Ms. Kincannon with the school board can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:37| I appreciate you letting me have the opportunity to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:41| I did speak to Commissioner Leuthold about it a couple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| and as soon as the draft of the amendment was available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| I shared it with the members of our board, and we discussed it at our meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:55| The good news is that I, in speaking to Administrator Greg McKay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8635)|
| 2:24:03| and our legal counsel, Marty McCampbell, I discovered the following things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:09| First, our school board districts are already compact, contiguous, and not overlapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:15| pursuant to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| So three out of the four criteria are already met, so that's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:21| The fourth one, apparently some of our districts do contain split voting precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| although I know my district, to my knowledge, does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| So I don't know, is there none in District 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:34| Maybe it's really just a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:36| I'd have to get, like you said, I think it would be good to do some more homework on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| to find out if this is going to address the problem in half a dozen cases, or 50, or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:49| So that's another thing I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| Another thing we discussed is that none of the few split precincts that do exist in school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8693)|
| 2:25:01| none were created by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| They used existing lines that were drawn by other entities, for example, City Council, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:11| I didn't do the history of every boundary and every split precinct to find out who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| But Commissioner Lutho is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| Some bodies, like Commission and our state legislative offices, are not allowed to split wards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| But what sometimes happens, since they still want to balance things out according to the population and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:33| and they don't have the right to split wards, they just create many out of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| So you have, for example, in North Hills, there's a 16-S and a 16-N.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| We didn't create that, and actually both are contained in my school board district and county commission district, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:52| So sometimes there have been occasions when the school board districts take advantage of existing things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8752)|
| 2:26:02| I think every elected official in this room and on the school board and commission is aware of the confusion that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:09| as Mr. Andrews was discussing, where someone lives in your commission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| but not in a different county school district number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| This amendment, as far as I can tell, Mr. Lutho, would not address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8780)|
| 2:26:25| It wouldn't affect that issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| Not necessarily, and that is a matter as far as aligning them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| The future school board and commissions can decide to have the exact same if they wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| But I intentionally stayed away from that so that the commission and the school board would have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| if they, for whatever reason, they felt like they wanted to align them maybe in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| But I do think it probably does force them to be more alike than disalike within some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8814)|
| 2:27:02| And that's what I was trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| I'm just trying to make it a little more less confusing for the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:13| And that's my only intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| I'm not trying to do anything other than trying to, because I've heard the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| I've stood in front of the polling places and I've had people call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| and not understand why they're in this particular district or that or how they came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:33| And I just felt like this might be a good way to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| And that's all I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:38| Well, I just think we need to know there may be and often are unintended consequences when you take actions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:47| And I would prefer before we act to find out as best we can what the consequences may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:54| In other words, how can we realign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| Now, obviously we're coming up on a census and some realignment anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8876)|
| 2:28:01| So this is confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:05| And perhaps I don't want to load more work on the election commission right now because we're right in the middle of elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:13| But I sure would like to know what the effect before we act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8893)|
| 2:28:16| Can I answer that just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| I just get back to the point that whatever consequences they would be would be the same as trying to draw the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8898)|
| 2:28:29| Because we have to do this as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| Commission districts cannot contain any split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8912)|
| 2:28:37| When we talk about consequences, I'm just not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Because they would just be following the same guidelines as commission in drawing their lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:48| And as far as I know, the only body that has the authority to split county voting precincts is the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:57| And then if there's an expense or a consequence, it's because the commission voted to split something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8937)|
| 2:29:06| So I'm just not real sure what are the consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:12| Because we really don't know what all the moving of lines and possibilities could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| until we get the census information back for the 2010 census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8958)|
| 2:29:23| And here's a plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| Get your census material in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| But we're going to have to redraw commission districts and school board districts before the 2012 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:38| And as you see here, this doesn't affect the current school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| It would just, when they go through their process of drawing their new district lines, which we'll have to do as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:51| they'll just use the same guidelines as the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:56| So I'm just not sure what consequences there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=8996)|
| 2:30:01| Well, since we have gone through a redrawing of the county commission districts recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| and I know that was a very thorough process, I guess I would just like to see some data on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| even if we have to use existing data, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:19| Or wait and see how that could be accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| We could certainly address an ordinance later on that, on the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:30| or put this in a resolution form that isn't quite so concrete, that is more of we'd like for you to comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:37| we'd like to have this as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| And I certainly agree with that sentiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| I'm just troubled by the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| Well, that's why I came back and changed it from being an ordinance to change the charter to just an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:53| Because it does make it a little more concrete than a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| but it's not set in stone where you have to wait for another ballot to come over to maybe change it and tweak it if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:09| And that's why I just put it in this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| So that's just on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:15| Commissioner Saunders, if you want to make either one of those a substitute motion, I'd be willing to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:22| Well, thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| I guess I would be most comfortable putting this off for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:33| and probably until we get the census data and we can actually deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| I'm a little reluctant to put something in place now and we really can't see what that effect is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:44| I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Well, I agree with the sentiment because I, like Commissioner Andrews, have several different school board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| and some of my constituents are equally as confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| So I guess I would just like to postpone it or table it until we get the census data and then try to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9117)|
| 2:32:06| And just in response to that, and I can understand some apprehension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:12| but I think by the time we get that, I think it's a little bit late in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| There's not a whole lot of time by the time we get the census information in the time that we're having to redraw lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9138)|
| 2:32:26| But if we have to redraw, we can try to affect that as we redraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9146)|
| 2:32:31| If we're redrawing the school board districts, we can do that anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| That could be part of what we charge ourselves with doing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| I guess I was just trying to make it so that everybody knew when the census material came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| they knew what they had to deal with and the guidelines they were following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| I'm just trying to, so everybody knows ahead of time what they're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:54| and what we're trying to accomplish, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| But I understand your apprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9177)|
| 2:33:02| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9182)|
| 2:33:04| Yeah, I just wanted to echo about the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| I mean, people will call me and they'll say, who's my school board representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:13| And then I look at the 1KGIS and I'm like, well, do you want the one that you actually vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| or do you want the one that serves the school that your children go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| And I mean, it's just very confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| I think Mr. Leuthold's idea is a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:33| And I know back during the redistricting, I was getting calls on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| Who's my school board representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| Who do I need to call on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| To which my reply was, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| But I do think there's a lot of confusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| I think this is a good first step in sorting this out and I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| Yes, thank you very much, India, for coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| I have a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| What is the recommendation of the Knox County School Board regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| I think the board would support tabling it until there's further information on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:17| how many split districts do we have, for example, we don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:21| And also whether this is, this remedy is fixing the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| The problem is voter confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| And it's, I think the board was, you know, shares the sentiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:36| and we all want to minimize voter confusion, although I don't think you can ever eliminate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:41| but that the board had reservations about whether this would address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| The problem that Commissioner Lambert just pointed out, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:50| is more of an issue of the difference between school zones and school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:54| You know, see, the thing is I think you're still going to have a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9294)|
| 2:34:58| Let's say, I mean, I'll give you a perfect example where I live, take somebody in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9298)|
| 2:35:03| and let's say you made the fifth district school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| and the fifth district commission the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| Well, you've got people then who still go up to Hardin Valley High School who live in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| And the question, it doesn't matter how you do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| the question is still going to be who should I call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| The person I vote for or the person that represents the school that my child attends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| Well, the question, when I get that question, I say call either or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| We both should be responsive to your needs because we represent the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| and people in this county and our votes affect everybody countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| So in some ways I try to catch it in terms that you're lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| You have two people advocating on your behalf instead of just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| And both people should be responsive to your needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9342)|
| 2:35:46| Because, I mean, I think this needs some consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:50| but it's not going to solve the confusion issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| I think the board would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| I think we have several issues on the table that are not issues of this thing that we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9364)|
| 2:36:12| I've heard that some school board members represent, well, in Powell apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9372)|
| 2:36:19| three different school board members represent children that would go to Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:26| I'd also say that in the 8th District there's one school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:31| and he represents two high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9391)|
| 2:36:34| I mean, how far diverse can you be in that kind of representation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| But that's not the question that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:41| We've also spoke, do you want to talk to the school board member that represents the area where the school is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:51| or do you want to talk to the school board member where your child lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| The commission districts and the school board districts, let me back up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9416)|
| 2:37:02| I don't think there's any way you can even look toward having those being the same guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9422)|
| 2:37:08| There are so many things that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| and the only thing that's really before us is whether or not precincts should be split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:18| I believe that that question really came up when we were trying to decide how to do recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9438)|
| 2:37:25| While we were trying to decide how to do recall, we lost one of the options because precincts are split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| and if we were working with the school board position being the recall subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| we lost one of our options because precincts are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| I think that going forward, we're only talking about should precincts be split and that's yes or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:52| and we're not doing it tomorrow, we're doing it after new census information comes out months from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:58| and the next school board elections or commission elections or countywide elections are two years away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| Would I be right if I were to say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| So we have lots of time to make whatever decision we want to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:11| but the only thing we're questioning right now is should we or should we not split precincts when we talk about school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9491)|
| 2:38:19| and probably to get rid of some inconsistencies, it would be better not to split precincts or to leave precincts whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:30| and I'll support this if it's just to say don't split precincts or school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| That is the intent, Commissioner, and like I got back when my first statement was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| is that I take a look at this as a precinct is the smallest community that the voting public has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:53| We vote in blocks as precincts and if a precinct can vote as a block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9533)|
| 2:39:03| or at least show that their support was for a certain particular candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9543)|
| 2:39:09| then they have supported that person and they can speak more as a community because that's the smallest that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:18| and I just think they speak stronger as a community when they speak as one instead of speak as maybe half or a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:29| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9569)|
| 2:39:32| I was just wondering if Greg McKay had anything to add to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9572)|
| 2:39:48| Greg McKay, room 218 in the courthouse, the Administrator of Elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| We talked about this last month. I'm not sure if I have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| It's really not an election commission question, but it's whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| I think actually the school board, if I'm not mistaken, is the one who chooses their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| There seems to be a lot of confusion about this, about what effect it's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:13| and a lot of confusion about whether it's going to fix a problem that some of you have articulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| and I'm not sure that it has anything to do with that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| The reason that people split precincts is to give flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| and we're not necessarily opposed to having split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| We would rather have split precincts than have someone bring in a plan and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:33| here, you have to create two precincts like dainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:36| and then we have more officers, more cost, more expense for the taxpayer and more confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9636)|
| 2:40:42| So, you know, I don't know whether to advise you on this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| but I can see the wisdom of thinking this over for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| Let's look and see what the consequences are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9652)|
| 2:40:59| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Just to respond to that just real quick, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| You know, Greg McKay is right as far as we don't want to have additional costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:11| but the only body that would cause there to be additional costs is this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| because it's the only body that can legally split a precinct into two new ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| where he would have to hire two new, you know, hire double the staff to hold an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9682)|
| 2:41:31| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Well, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| Part of the precinct confusion could be, and we could affect this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| could be clarified to some extent by the suggestion that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| and unfortunately not implemented to do convenience voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| Then you eliminate some of Greg's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| But secondly, I would move that we simply table this for right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9715)|
| 2:42:02| make a substitute motion to table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| Commissioner Burroughs, you have something on the table, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| No, it's on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| I need clarification from the law director on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9749)|
| 2:42:30| I had this conversation with the law director last week about whether or not there seems to be some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9750)|
| 2:42:39| in our charter, which is, of course, nothing new, about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| or not the county commission does school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9763)|
| 2:42:49| or whether the school board does school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| And is there, can you basically tell them what you told me earlier last week about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9772)|
| 2:43:02| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:04| you have essentially two different sections within the Knox County Charter and Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9784)|
| 2:43:12| I'm not sure if they're incongruent, but section 6.01 on the Board of Education reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9792)|
| 2:43:17| the districts of the members of the Board of Education shall be the districts that shall exist on December 31st, 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:25| But more importantly, the Board of Education by resolution may from time to time alter the boundaries of districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:32| so as long as all districts comply with the constitutional requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| And then under the county commission portion, it reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| voting precincts of Knox County shall be established by the commission by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| unless otherwise provided by applicable law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| So it's not a modicum of clarity, but obviously if I thought the ordinance was contrary to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:56| I would have told Commissioner Littlehole from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| We have a substitute motion on the floor to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:06| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| Roll call starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| How long is the table for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| It's until someone brings it up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| It essentially kills it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| Can we say table until the 2010 census?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Well, that would just be a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:25| Tabling it is a legislative way of killing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| That's a decider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| Commissioner Littlehole is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Somebody can bring it back up any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| This motion is to table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| Commissioner Pinkston votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9888)|
| 2:44:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9890)|
| 2:44:51| Commissioner Brown votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9894)|
| 2:44:55| Commissioner Wright votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| Commissioner Armstrong votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9900)|
| 2:45:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| Commissioner Carringer votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9902)|
| 2:45:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9904)|
| 2:45:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100322part1?start=9908)|
