| 2:46:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| What I want to discuss here is this savings account, I guess, for the schools, or we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9962)|
| 2:46:10| it a voucher program, whatever it is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| And this is to move students from one school to another school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| And having reviewed how much it costs per school where we've got these figures, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9979)|
| 2:46:26| much it costs to, you know, how much students cost at each school, we have some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| schools that are failing schools that the cost of that student to that school could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9993)|
| 2:46:40| be as much as $12,000, $10,000, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| And when they move those kids out of that school, well, the cost of educating the rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10005)|
| 2:46:52| of the kids that are left in that school that don't take the voucher program, how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| more is it going to cost to educate the remaining students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10016)|
| 2:47:00| Because that's going to reduce the amount of money that goes into those failing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| And then I see in the paper that maybe only Davidson and Shelby County may be doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10026)|
| 2:47:12| voucher program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| So as of right now, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| But what I wanted to find out, when we start moving kids from one school to another school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10036)|
| 2:47:22| how much is that going to really affect their budget in keeping those schools open and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10042)|
| 2:47:29| Because sometimes that child that's in that school that they're paying $12,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| to educate moves to one that they only use about $5,000 to educate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10056)|
| 2:47:43| That's going to take a lot of money out of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10063)|
| 2:47:48| So how does that affect those individual schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| And are we going to have to look at a budgetary item to try to keep those schools open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| What are we going to do with those schools that the cost of educating each child goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10077)|
| 2:48:03| noticeably higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10083)|
| 2:48:06| And that's all I wanted to bring forth on that because it seems like it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10086)|
| 2:48:10| a budgetary problem for us as the commission and for the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10090)|
| 2:48:15| if we go with those voucher programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| And how's the state going to handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10098)|
| 2:48:21| They say now that they're going to pay for it in the first three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10101)|
| 2:48:25| And after the first three years, it's only going to be $1,000 that they're going to put back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10105)|
| 2:48:30| The figures just don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| Well, I'll go ahead in the spirit of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10114)|
| 2:48:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker, if you wanted to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| I was just going to say maybe Mr. Oaks or somebody from the schools has the latest up-to-date word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10119)|
| 2:48:44| on what's going on in Nashville on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| Yeah, frankly, that's kind of what I'd like to hear if it's the superintendent or our CFO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| whoever's got the latest update on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| At least speaking for myself, not necessarily the whole body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| I mean, it seems like we're getting different information from the House versions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| and the Senate version, and I don't know that any of us know exactly what's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| but it can sure have a significant, potentially negative impact on our schools here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10145)|
| 2:49:13| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| And you're right, there are two different versions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| There have been amendments to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| I don't know what the latest amendments are today, but a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| We belong to the coalition of large school systems across the state, four largest school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| and some numbers were put together for us that I'll share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10174)|
| 2:49:39| If you look at the numbers of students eligible in the first year, 5,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| what that would mean to Knox County is approximately, if you just did it on a percentage basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| because there's 283,319 students involved in those districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10189)|
| 2:49:57| the percentage of students for us would be about 19.5% or 973 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10197)|
| 2:50:04| possibly out of 5,000 that would be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10204)|
| 2:50:07| When you look at the value, the estimated voucher value, roughly $7,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10207)|
| 2:50:13| you'd be looking in the first year, if that money did not go into the BEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| that's about $6.6 million for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| If you looked at 30,000 students, once it plays out, it could mean about $40 million to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10223)|
| 2:50:31| Those are numbers that were provided to us by the coalition of large school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| Commissioner Busler, I would doubt that there would be enough students in a school to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| to where you could actually reduce the number of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10243)|
| 2:50:47| because again, it's not just the failing schools where students may transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10247)|
| 2:50:53| It's all the schools, as long as you meet the financial income level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10253)|
| 2:51:05| As long as you meet that income level, no matter what school you go to in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| you're eligible to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| If it's for students who are in failing schools, I'm not sure I understand the logic behind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10273)|
| 2:51:20| but any student who meets that financial piece in Knox County, whatever school they go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10280)|
| 2:51:26| would be eligible for the voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| Even if we had no schools in the bottom 10%, we always remain as an ESA district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10288)|
| 2:51:36| so we never lose that label.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10296)|
| 2:51:40| That's a concern, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10300)|
| 2:51:43| Then the concern that it's open to all students in our high schools is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10303)|
| 2:51:50| What I was getting at, Mr. Thomas, is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| You have schools that have anywhere from 100, 200, 245, 290.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10316)|
| 2:52:04| I could go down through here with the schools that have the small populations in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10324)|
| 2:52:09| Say you get 40 or 50 students out of that school that moves and goes to one of these other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10329)|
| 2:52:17| that's a large percentage of the money that goes to that school, goes with those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10337)|
| 2:52:24| What are we going to have to do with that school and the students that remain there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| How much money are we going to have to put in those schools to keep them open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10349)|
| 2:52:34| Are we going to keep them open? That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| Again, you're talking about high schools, so the enrollment at most of our high schools is going to be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| But I don't see any decrease in the money being spent at those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| just because there's students who transfer out to private schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10368)|
| 2:52:53| We're going to continue, in my opinion, going to continue to have to pay what we're paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10373)|
| 2:52:59| Unless 100 students leave out of a school, let's say 100 juniors leave out of one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10379)|
| 2:53:06| maybe you could make an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| But I don't see any decrease in the cost that we currently are providing to operate the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10388)|
| 2:53:16| So, if I'm misstating anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10396)|
| 2:53:24| Will that affect a school like Career Magnet, which has about, what, 250, 300 kids in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10404)|
| 2:53:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10412)|
| 2:53:34| So, again, it would depend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10414)|
| 2:53:36| If 10 students leave, I don't see that you're going to be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| or we're going to be able to make an adjustment to the teaching staff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| It's not going to make any difference administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10424)|
| 2:53:48| We're going to have the same number of administrators, the same number of custodians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10428)|
| 2:53:52| and most likely the same number of students unless 50 or 60 of them were to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10432)|
| 2:53:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| Something like that did occur in some of those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| If you have, like, say 20% transfer from a school that has, here's one that has 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10442)|
| 2:54:20| No, let's just say you have one that has here that's 920 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| 20% of them leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10465)|
| 2:54:28| Are they all in one class, or are there 9th graders, 10th graders, 11th graders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10468)|
| 2:54:34| You can't reduce the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| You can't reduce the teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10476)|
| 2:54:38| What's that going to cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| It would cost what we're continuing to pay for those schools, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| Okay, it's going to cost the same, but the money follows the child, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10484)|
| 2:54:49| For the first three years, we get the money reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10489)|
| 2:54:53| We potentially would lose those funds, but still have to maintain the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10493)|
| 2:54:58| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10498)|
| 2:54:59| We don't know how much this education bill is really going to cost the taxpayers in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10499)|
| 2:55:05| If we try to maintain all the schools that we're maintaining now at the same funding level, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10505)|
| 2:55:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| It, to me, looks like, from the standpoint of what I know about it, that we're going to lose the funding for those students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10515)|
| 2:55:25| but we're still going to have to maintain the teaching staff, most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10525)|
| 2:55:29| Again, it would depend on the number of students who transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10529)|
| 2:55:34| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| We don't know what we don't know about how many are going to transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| Yes, I don't know anybody that could tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| No, but it's a question that's kind of bothersome to me that if it affects those schools so negatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10543)|
| 2:55:53| and I don't want to raise taxes, but it looks like it could force us to raise taxes to keep those schools functioning as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10553)|
| 2:56:02| That potentially . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| Is the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Possibility, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| Thank you, Commissioner Boesler, and I think kind of what you're saying, Superintendent Thomas, is we've got a certain fixed cost of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10569)|
| 2:56:16| and if you lose money and lose some students, we still are going to have to cover some of that fixed cost, if that's kind of what you're saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10576)|
| 2:56:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| Just a point of clarification here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| Did you say statewide there's like 283,000 and change kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10597)|
| 2:56:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10598)|
| 2:56:39| In the school districts, if you look at Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Shelby, and Madison, the ones that were originally named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10599)|
| 2:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| So of the big four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10606)|
| 2:56:49| Well, that's actually five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| Five, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10611)|
| 2:56:52| But we belong to the big four school districts belong to the coalition of large school systems, and the numbers were prepared by . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10612)|
| 2:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| But just of the big five counties that you listed, we're still educating 20% of that total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10621)|
| 2:57:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10627)|
| 2:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10638)|
| 2:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10640)|
| 2:57:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10645)|
| 2:57:26| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| Item number 39, Resolution 902, is removing Commissioner Ellen Gill as a member of the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10647)|
| 2:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10657)|
| 2:57:38| That item is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| Commissioner Jay, I think you first brought that item onto the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| Did you want to . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10665)|
| 2:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10666)|
| 2:57:47| Commissioner Jay moves for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10669)|
| 2:57:50| Is there a second on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| There's a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10678)|
| 2:57:59| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10679)|
| 2:58:00| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| My fellow commissioners, I urge you to support this resolution in the name of good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10684)|
| 2:58:09| Tonight, I also urge you to stay focused on the resolution and really not get into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10689)|
| 2:58:14| weeds of unrelated issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10694)|
| 2:58:16| This resolution is really a policy decision about the effectiveness of a committee member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10696)|
| 2:58:21| based on longstanding and publicly contentious relationship with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| It is not now, nor was it ever, intended to be a discussion about the Commissioner Gill's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| legal or personal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| This is not about litigating any legal cases or determining fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| This is simply my desire to run a productive and effective joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| I'd like to clarify just a few things from last week's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| During last week's discussion, it was said that I disclosed HR issues and brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| things that shouldn't have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| It was nothing I mentioned that hasn't either been publicly reported in local media or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10731)|
| 2:58:55| available in public record school system personnel files, which I've reviewed firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10735)|
| 2:59:01| It was also said that I had been unprofessional in my actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| Please remember, I informed this body that I had tried to reach out to Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| prior to filing the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| The professional thing to do would have been to simply acknowledge my repeated communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| attempts, ask to set up a meeting, file a sunshine notice, sit down and have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10754)|
| 2:59:19| and try to work through the solution together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| Instead, after multiple tries, I received no response at all, and then filing this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10761)|
| 2:59:27| was my only course of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| This resolution is not about liking Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| If the circumstances were the same for another commissioner serving on the joint education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| committee, I would have asked them to step aside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10777)|
| 2:59:40| No, this is not like high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10780)|
| 2:59:42| It is far more important than petty personality conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10782)|
| 2:59:46| The school board chair and my co-chair on the joint education committee have both made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10786)|
| 2:59:50| it publicly known that they, too, feel it would be better to have a different commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10790)|
| 2:59:54| on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| Remember, commission members of the joint education committee represent you in matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| related to our education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10800)|
| 3:00:02| Please place serious value on this important relationship and join me in trying to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| better interactions with the school system and ultimately building meaningful and lasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| I continue to believe it is extremely difficult to see how Commissioner Gill could be effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10813)|
| 3:00:17| and objective given her past disciplinary and legal issues with the Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| I believe I made the case for cause of removal based on effectiveness and a potential conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10822)|
| 3:00:28| of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10828)|
| 3:00:29| To continue to remain a member of the joint education committee would be to place an unproductive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| cloud over all of our future proceedings and accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| Regardless of the outcome tonight, I will work hard to run the joint education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| and be fair and productive as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| I urge you to vote in favor of this resolution, and please let us return to the focus of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| joint education committee back to productive proceedings and good relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10853)|
| 3:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10855)|
| 3:00:56| In order of the lights, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10856)|
| 3:01:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10861)|
| 3:01:06| This particular item has caused way too much of our time and also distracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10866)|
| 3:01:19| And so whatever Commissioner Gill did or did not do, I really feel that the public has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| the right to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| As elected public officials, it is our duty to be transparent to the citizens that elect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10887)|
| 3:01:33| us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10893)|
| 3:01:37| And in order for us to find out and to let our public know what happened or what did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10897)|
| 3:01:43| not happen, there are procedures to go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| However, what we are voting on tonight is a resolution of voting to keep Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10909)|
| 3:01:57| Gill on the joint education committee or remove her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10917)|
| 3:02:02| From last week's workshop, it appears that Commissioner Gill is not going to resign from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10922)|
| 3:02:08| the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10928)|
| 3:02:12| So, therefore, from several years of being a parent, I learned very early on to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10932)|
| 3:02:21| my battles with my children in terms of discipline and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10941)|
| 3:02:27| And our joint education committee is a very, very vital committee, I feel, for our Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10947)|
| 3:02:34| County Commission and our Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| When looking back on our schedule, because our board co-chair and our commissioner chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10958)|
| 3:02:47| Commissioner Jay, have done an excellent job this year, and they scheduled out the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| way in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10974)|
| 3:02:56| So according to my calendar, we have a meeting for June 26th and I believe August the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10976)|
| 3:03:04| So we have two meetings that are left for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10984)|
| 3:03:08| June 26th will be when the teachers are already back at school and the kids are getting ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10988)|
| 3:03:15| and parents are taking their last vacations and hoorah for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| August the 28th will be just less than a week, probably three or four days before we go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11000)|
| 3:03:27| re-elect a new joint education committee for the next year, which more than likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11007)|
| 3:03:34| there will be some changes, one or two from the school board and one or two from ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11014)|
| 3:03:40| So the August the 28th meeting is probably not going to be that productive in my eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11020)|
| 3:03:47| So it leaves like June 26th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11027)|
| 3:03:53| And, you know, it's very hard because we're all elected officials and we're all in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11033)|
| 3:04:01| to represent our taxpayers and to do what's right and to do what's been elected, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11041)|
| 3:04:08| we've been elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| And I feel like this has taken up way too much time, the whole instance, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11050)|
| 3:04:16| other ways to pursue to let other people know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| So it's kind of almost now like we're wasting way too much time on this and it's not worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11060)|
| 3:04:32| our time that we need to just vote and be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11072)|
| 3:04:40| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11080)|
| 3:04:43| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11086)|
| 3:04:47| Let me say I've already served on the education committee since being elected to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11087)|
| 3:04:53| Let me say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| In 15 plus years of professional service as a special ed teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| Let me clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| You made it personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| You contacted me with unmitigated gall and hurled threats to me on multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11105)|
| 3:05:19| So let's get that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| Let's get that on the record right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11124)|
| 3:05:30| Now, what is important is if you have any questions about that case and the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11130)|
| 3:05:37| I was cleared, I think the law director cleared that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| But you opted to look at my personnel file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| You opted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| You opted to add that element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| So you opted to make that part of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11151)|
| 3:05:55| And if my behavior, which is all recorded on film, part of the education committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11155)|
| 3:06:02| have been unsatisfactory, then, you know, really that would have been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11162)|
| 3:06:08| But it hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11168)|
| 3:06:10| So this really was about additional things that were brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11170)|
| 3:06:19| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11179)|
| 3:06:21| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| Mr. Co-Chair, who's on the, for the commission and for the school board, who's on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11184)|
| 3:06:30| Committee members from this body include myself, Commissioner Gill, Commissioner Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11190)|
| 3:06:37| and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11197)|
| 3:06:39| And then from the school board, board members Susan Horn, Patty Bounds, Virginia Babb, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11199)|
| 3:06:48| Ebony Satterfield, who is the co-chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11208)|
| 3:06:52| You know, I lost some sleep on this, probably a loose sleep again tonight and a few other nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11212)|
| 3:06:58| I have a hard time, and right now I'll probably pass on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11218)|
| 3:07:02| Why did you not go before the education committee first and get a vote of confidence out of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11222)|
| 3:07:07| and then you could have bring it to us with a vote of confidence or non-confidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| And that way I would have felt better with my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| My question to you is, may I ask the question to the Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11237)|
| 3:07:22| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11242)|
| 3:07:23| Why did not the education co-chairs have a vote for confidence or non-confidence, confidence, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11243)|
| 3:07:30| for this resolution or her confidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| I don't know if I have a good answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| I tried to resolve this directly and contact Commissioner Gill directly to try to resolve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11257)|
| 3:07:45| before it even got to committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| It was absolutely, and I said this in my message, it was not my intent to embarrass or to make this a bigger deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11266)|
| 3:07:54| I'm trying to run a committee, and I made my opinion known, and then publicly the co-chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11274)|
| 3:08:02| my other co-chair also agreed with my position and so did the school board chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11282)|
| 3:08:07| but perhaps that might have been a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| I was trying to resolve this directly and then by looking at the charter and looking at the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| in which we placed members on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11295)|
| 3:08:18| Also, that committee does not vote on our membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| We vote on our membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| So at the end of the day, when I looked at the rules, I looked at the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| it said we vote to put people on by committee by resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| and therefore we take people off by resolution or we change positions by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11310)|
| 3:08:35| I could have gotten a non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11315)|
| 3:08:37| I could have taken this to them and gotten maybe a non-binding agreement from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11317)|
| 3:08:44| I did not want to use the joint education committee's time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11324)|
| 3:08:48| We have had very, very productive discussions, and our next actually, just a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11328)|
| 3:08:55| we actually have three meetings remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| We have a May 6 meeting, which will be about the budget, and then a June 26 and August 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11337)|
| 3:09:03| Isn't the May meeting, though, with everybody, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| We're inviting them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| I was talking about just joint education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| To answer your question in short, it was by process of the charter that says how we add and remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11352)|
| 3:09:17| They would not vote for the removal because that is our job legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11357)|
| 3:09:23| That's not their job as board members to vote on our stuff, just like it's not our job to vote on their issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11363)|
| 3:09:29| Perhaps I could have taken it to them and gotten something that was more non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11369)|
| 3:09:37| much in hindsight, but this was the process per the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11377)|
| 3:09:41| I wouldn't ask for a—all I would have asked for would probably have been a vote of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11381)|
| 3:09:47| That's not for removal, so a vote of confidence or non-confidence from the education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11387)|
| 3:09:53| would have went a long way in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11393)|
| 3:09:58| Commissioner Bussler and Commissioner Thomas and Commissioner Anders got raked through the cold a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11398)|
| 3:10:07| on this ethics committee, and it's tough, you know, to have your name drug through the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11407)|
| 3:10:14| I'll say the mud or whatever, so this is why this decision of me is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11414)|
| 3:10:19| I'm not taking it—you know, I've taken it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| Like I say, I have lost some sleep over this decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| and I'm not saying that you've got a bad resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11425)|
| 3:10:29| You know, you may have merit to your resolution, but at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| I'm going to have to pass because I just don't feel confident that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11433)|
| 3:10:39| there is going to be a 1,000-pound elephant in every room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| There's a 2,000-pound elephant sitting in here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| The next special education committee, there's going to be a 1,000-pound elephant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| We're not going to get rid of the elephant, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| I'll probably have to pass on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11452)|
| 3:10:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11459)|
| 3:11:00| I was going to try to sit here and be real quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11460)|
| 3:11:01| Since my name's been mentioned, I thought I'd make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11464)|
| 3:11:08| Here's the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| How many years have you served on the education committee, Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| Three, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11476)|
| 3:11:18| Let me make sure I say you said resign or else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11478)|
| 3:11:24| Can I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11484)|
| 3:11:26| I've still got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11486)|
| 3:11:29| Okay, so she's been on here for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| I went back and I looked at November, December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| I didn't think there was a—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| No, was it November or February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11501)|
| 3:11:45| November, December and February meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11505)|
| 3:11:51| I think when you all had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| I've got them on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11513)|
| 3:11:54| Those are boring meetings, but anyway, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11514)|
| 3:11:58| I didn't see some things on there that would make me come to a conclusion that we have before us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11518)|
| 3:12:16| I don't see anything that's changed, really, because those—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11536)|
| 3:12:24| I haven't seen any changes in Evelyn's demeanor since I've been on commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11544)|
| 3:12:33| If I asked Evelyn to be truthful about it and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11553)|
| 3:12:37| hey, if you felt like you couldn't do this properly, would you resign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11557)|
| 3:12:44| She would probably tell me yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11564)|
| 3:12:46| but I think she feels like she can do it without letting those hang over her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11566)|
| 3:12:55| Like I said in the other meeting, I felt uncomfortable where we were at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11575)|
| 3:13:01| because that committee was a committee just to make the rhetoric between the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11581)|
| 3:13:08| the school board and the county commission, a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11588)|
| 3:13:19| I sat on that board, I think, for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11599)|
| 3:13:23| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| It's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11605)|
| 3:13:26| We didn't have regular meetings like we do now, but we discussed things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11606)|
| 3:13:33| I don't think what we discussed and what the actions were taken and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11613)|
| 3:13:37| during that time that I was on there would warrant this kind of discussion between us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11617)|
| 3:13:44| but it has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| We're going to have to vote one way or the other, up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11627)|
| 3:13:52| I don't like to be forced in a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| Again, the Constitution's been argued at the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11634)|
| 3:14:01| that we all have the right to our good name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| There is not, even though it's been an accusation, it's not proven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11644)|
| 3:14:13| and you can't use it, as the law director says, as part of your idea of voting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11653)|
| 3:14:23| So we're in this mess because somebody thought, somebody reasoned or thought about somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11663)|
| 3:14:34| I don't know what's going on in your mind right now as I'm talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| You're probably just going to say, I wish you'd shut up so we could get on with the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| That never crossed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| I thought it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11684)|
| 3:14:48| But here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11688)|
| 3:14:50| We're in a situation we shouldn't be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| Right now, we should not be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| Whichever way we vote, nobody's going to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11696)|
| 3:15:01| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| And that's where we're at right now, and I think that's a bad position for this body to be put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11704)|
| 3:15:10| and I said that the other day, and we're in a position still today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| that we've got to answer the question that's been brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11714)|
| 3:15:20| So if somebody's going to have to make a decision, and Lord help us, whatever we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11720)|
| 3:15:28| it's going to bring this back to haunt us in a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11728)|
| 3:15:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11735)|
| 3:15:36| Commissioner Jay, your light came on, but I know you spoke earlier on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11736)|
| 3:15:39| just trying to stay with Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| Commissioner Anders has not spoken on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| I don't want to defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11743)|
| 3:15:44| I want to be the last one to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11744)|
| 3:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11745)|
| 3:15:46| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11746)|
| 3:15:47| I want to just enter one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11747)|
| 3:15:52| It's not really for the record, but for our clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11752)|
| 3:15:56| I did ask for the history of this committee from our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11756)|
| 3:16:01| who's been taking diligent notes since 2013 when it was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11761)|
| 3:16:07| Just to be clear, the only place that Commissioner Gill's name appears was in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11767)|
| 3:16:14| when she was appointed to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11774)|
| 3:16:17| A committee met on February 8, 2017, and she was appointed as co-chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11777)|
| 3:16:24| and no further meetings were scheduled for that entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11784)|
| 3:16:28| So it was one year and two years prior, but that chairmanship was only one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11788)|
| 3:16:34| and they never met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| We have rekindled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| I will just say, this is about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11796)|
| 3:16:39| This is not about going backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| This is about the fact that I'm trying to build productive relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11801)|
| 3:16:46| and moving forward in a way that does not have conflict of interest potentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11806)|
| 3:16:51| does not have effectiveness issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| and does not have a cloud over the further proceedings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| as we build better relationships together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| As it was formed originally, and as I hope it will continue to work together as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11818)|
| 3:17:02| it's about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| It's not about litigating the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11824)|
| 3:17:05| It's not about litigating a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11825)|
| 3:17:06| It's not about litigating everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| It's about moving forward together, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11833)|
| 3:17:14| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11834)|
| 3:17:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| This body is a family to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| We spend a lot of time together, get to know each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11842)|
| 3:17:25| Families have discussions and disputes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11845)|
| 3:17:28| and we just have to have ours in the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| That's part of the negativity of being in public office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11854)|
| 3:17:40| where we have to do all of our stuff in public to make it lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11860)|
| 3:17:46| I don't totally wholeheartedly agree with the measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11866)|
| 3:17:51| and I don't wholeheartedly disagree with the measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| but I think the resolution has the potential, more potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11875)|
| 3:18:00| negative or just as much negative potential as it does positive potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11880)|
| 3:18:05| Everybody has said their piece, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11885)|
| 3:18:09| and I think being the elder statesman in the room on the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11889)|
| 3:18:14| I think it would be wise for me to withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11894)|
| 3:18:19| We've said everything we're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11899)|
| 3:18:20| We're not voting if I withdraw my second unless somebody else seconds the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11900)|
| 3:18:26| I think we've said our piece, and we need to move on, and I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11906)|
| 3:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11914)|
| 3:18:35| Commissioner Anderson has withdrawn his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11915)|
| 3:18:36| We'll look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11916)|
| 3:18:39| Where does that put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11919)|
| 3:18:44| You have a motion on the floor without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11924)|
| 3:18:47| To continue to a vote, you will have to acquire a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11927)|
| 3:18:51| If you do not acquire a second, the motion will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11931)|
| 3:18:54| For lack of a second, there will be no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11934)|
| 3:19:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11943)|
| 3:19:04| You've still got a slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11944)|
| 3:19:05| Is there anyone who wants to make a second to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11945)|
| 3:19:14| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11954)|
| 3:19:29| Well, as chair, I usually don't try to weigh in on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11969)|
| 3:19:33| but I guess I see where both Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Anders are on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11973)|
| 3:19:41| It's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| I've lost a lot of sleep on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| I don't know that as chair, if I put in a second, I don't know if the votes are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11984)|
| 3:19:51| Usually as chair, I prefer not to engage in those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| but I don't know that the votes are there for this to even pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=11995)|
| 3:20:02| But it's tough on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12002)|
| 3:20:08| Ultimately, I think what Commissioner Jay wants is effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| I know he's passionate for effective and good governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| When I look at the key verbiage in here, and knowing Commissioner Jay like I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12017)|
| 3:20:24| I think his real passion is effective government on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12024)|
| 3:20:29| I mean, that is his number one passion and where he stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| But unfortunately, things like this do get us, as the elder statesman says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12033)|
| 3:20:40| I guess our longest serving statesman here has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| it does put a family fight right out here on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12043)|
| 3:20:47| We do have, I think, a couple of meetings scheduled for this committee, I believe in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12047)|
| 3:20:57| and as Commissioner Carringer had said, in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| I, you know, effect, and then we reorgan, if all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12061)|
| 3:21:05| I mean, if it's the will of this body, we could, you know, that is another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12065)|
| 3:21:10| If this body would like to restructure this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| that is an option that this body would have in September, October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12074)|
| 3:21:18| whenever our next reorg meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12078)|
| 3:21:23| But at least reading the room, I don't think that the votes are here for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12083)|
| 3:21:30| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12090)|
| 3:21:35| Mr. Chairman, there's no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| This is a strange, quiet awkwardness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| I think we need to move on with the county's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| Seeing no second, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12103)|
| 3:21:49| All right. I'm sorry. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12109)|
| 3:21:52| I saw some battles here, but I'm going to say this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12112)|
| 3:21:55| As soon as I walk out that door, it's forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| So hopefully tonight will be forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12118)|
| 3:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12123)|
| 3:22:04| Resolution 903 is requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12128)|
| 3:22:11| to require all tax amendments to the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| to be initiated by resolution of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12134)|
| 3:22:21| Okay. Commissioner Schoonmaker, you brought that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| Thank you. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12147)|
| 3:22:30| Okay. We have a proper motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| and a second from Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| I am seeing lights on from Smith and Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12155)|
| 3:22:40| And Mr. King, are you here to talk about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12160)|
| 3:22:43| Okay. I'll go ahead and call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| Go ahead and let Mr. King speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12167)|
| 3:22:48| Commissioner King, would you like to go ahead and approach the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12168)|
| 3:22:57| John King, 620 Market Street in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12177)|
| 3:23:02| And I first apologize for my attire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12182)|
| 3:23:06| I did not know I was going to be coming here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12186)|
| 3:23:12| I found out when I looked at the agenda for today at about 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12192)|
| 3:23:18| and then got a copy of the proposed resolution and looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12198)|
| 3:23:26| I thought I've got to find a tie somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12206)|
| 3:23:31| So in any event, despite my attire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| I am a citizen, a resident of Knoxville, Knox County, and a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12216)|
| 3:23:43| And I wanted to speak in opposition to this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12223)|
| 3:23:53| If you read the resolution, it says the Knox County Commission hereby requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12233)|
| 3:24:01| that the Metropolitan Planning Commission consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| and make recommendations on appropriate amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12245)|
| 3:24:12| to require all text amendments to the zoning ordinance to be initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12252)|
| 3:24:20| by resolution of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| Currently, those text amendments really can arise in sort of three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12265)|
| 3:24:36| This would, in essence, cut out the public or a public request, citizen request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12276)|
| 3:24:45| for a text amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| It also eliminates initiation of a text amendment by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12288)|
| 3:24:59| I think that this one is, if you read the Tennessee Code on the zoning power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12299)|
| 3:25:09| and the zoning authority of municipalities and counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12309)|
| 3:25:14| the concept is that zoning amendments start with action by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12314)|
| 3:25:23| As a matter of fact, the ordinance says that no matter may be voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12323)|
| 3:25:33| or considered by this body until it has first been to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12333)|
| 3:25:44| for review and recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12344)|
| 3:25:48| This sort of gets a little bit out of that mode in that this body is being asked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12348)|
| 3:25:57| if you will, in some sense, prejudge a request without benefit of that evaluation first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12357)|
| 3:26:05| and make a decision whether it's to be pursued or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12365)|
| 3:26:10| if you all are the sole body that initiates these requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12370)|
| 3:26:15| I would say it's a subject matter that I deal with a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12375)|
| 3:26:22| but things occur in reality that necessitate some changes in language or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12382)|
| 3:26:33| and it's easily accomplished through dealing with the staff at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12393)|
| 3:26:42| and then ultimately coming before this body for a vote on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12402)|
| 3:26:50| It will involve you all on the record prior to any action by the entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12410)|
| 3:26:59| which is the one to perform an analysis and make recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12419)|
| 3:27:06| and that's sort of the opposite of what the statutory framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12426)|
| 3:27:12| or the statutory scheme seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12432)|
| 3:27:17| Then I think about the practical issues is it adds time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12437)|
| 3:27:24| to the process of getting resolution on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12444)|
| 3:27:30| It's usually something that is like an example would be you got a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12450)|
| 3:27:39| and it's zoned agricultural, and it's pretty much in an agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12459)|
| 3:27:48| This owner wants to store something on that property that is not an agricultural use, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12468)|
| 3:28:01| and what can be done is staff looks at it and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12481)|
| 3:28:14| well, it's not inappropriate that that be considered as a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12494)|
| 3:28:22| Rather than rezoning this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| this storage is clearly permitted as a commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| but you don't want to rezone this piece of agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| in the middle of a bunch of other agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| You don't want to rezone it commercial just so we can do that activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12517)|
| 3:28:41| So you look at it and you make a conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12521)|
| 3:28:45| well, let's go ahead and correct that by permitting a limited amount of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12525)|
| 3:28:52| whatever storage it is, to occur in an agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12532)|
| 3:28:56| and I propose to amend the zoning ordinance to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12536)|
| 3:29:03| Now you've just added another process of having to come before this body in some manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12543)|
| 3:29:12| to seek action by this body to ask the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12552)|
| 3:29:21| to tell the planning commission to either go forward in looking at that or not going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12561)|
| 3:29:28| It's a minimum of 30 days at best of more time involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12568)|
| 3:29:34| in trying to resolve what are relatively common-type issues that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12574)|
| 3:29:45| Time is a big problem in development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| Time is a big problem in property utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12587)|
| 3:29:51| To me, this one, as I say, sort of gets out of sync with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12591)|
| 3:30:04| There's not a provision here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12604)|
| 3:30:10| and I haven't had time to analyze it as to how one gets to get the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12610)|
| 3:30:21| to initiate a tax change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| I would assume that it's going to involve getting on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12625)|
| 3:30:30| and trying to get that on the agenda for action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12630)|
| 3:30:37| and then once you prevail there and get it on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| you've still got another meeting to go after that before you get to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12642)|
| 3:30:47| where you're really looking at whether this amendment should be adopted or not adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12647)|
| 3:30:57| I think there's a lot of questions that are sort of unanswered the way it's presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12657)|
| 3:31:04| but I really question the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12664)|
| 3:31:09| What you're doing is on this particular type of an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12669)|
| 3:31:15| you're going to amend the language in the statute as opposed to a zoning amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12675)|
| 3:31:22| You're going to amend that language, and then you're adding these additional steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12682)|
| 3:31:28| and it cuts out the public involvement except to the extent of coming down before this body in some fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12688)|
| 3:31:41| and asking for this body to ask or submit to MPC a request to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12701)|
| 3:31:54| and I think it's, as I say, runs contrary to the intent of the statute which was set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12714)|
| 3:32:04| when we started in the powers of the counties and the municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12724)|
| 3:32:09| We just had the planning commission as the initial body to review, analyze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12729)|
| 3:32:17| and make a recommendation before this body acts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12737)|
| 3:32:22| and I wish I had a little more time to spend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| I probably could have raised some more issues, but those are the main ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| It certainly increases the time required to get a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12751)|
| 3:32:36| It seems to sort of get reversed the cart and the horse a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12756)|
| 3:32:43| and I would ask that you seriously consider your vote on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12763)|
| 3:32:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12771)|
| 3:32:53| I'm unaware of a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| I haven't been involved in a problem where the current system doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12776)|
| 3:33:03| because whatever county commission is the last stop so that wherever the proposed amendment comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12783)|
| 3:33:16| it's this body that ultimately determines whether or not it's going to be passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12796)|
| 3:33:22| and I think that what we have currently in place is more than sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12802)|
| 3:33:29| to protect the interests of all the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12809)|
| 3:33:32| I always hate, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12812)|
| 3:33:37| I always hate to come before this body and speak in opposition to something one of you wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12817)|
| 3:33:47| I think about that before I do it, and in this instance I thought I ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12827)|
| 3:33:56| I've done so, and I mean no disrespect for you or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12836)|
| 3:34:05| It's just we have a legitimate difference of opinion on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12845)|
| 3:34:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12852)|
| 3:34:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| Hey, John, who'd you bill that out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12861)|
| 3:34:26| I'm down here clientless at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12866)|
| 3:34:30| You know it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| Commercial now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12872)|
| 3:34:35| I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| This adds time to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12877)|
| 3:34:40| It takes away the public input and a trained professional staff's input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12880)|
| 3:34:46| and puts it in the hands of a political body when it has no fiscal impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12886)|
| 3:34:53| Director Green, could you please come down, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12893)|
| 3:35:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| Sir, in your opinion, is this process needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12904)|
| 3:35:12| Again, I'll start where Mr. King left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12912)|
| 3:35:15| I mean no disrespect if I disagree with the commissioner, but the process seems to be working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12915)|
| 3:35:23| We hear requests for ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12923)|
| 3:35:26| Sometimes they're brought up by staff, sometimes by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12926)|
| 3:35:31| sometimes by members of this commission, and sometimes by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12931)|
| 3:35:37| We have a process that staff reviews the information, makes a drafting, an ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12937)|
| 3:35:46| presents that to the Planning Commission at a public hearing, and then their recommendation comes to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12946)|
| 3:35:52| And there are some amendments where we actually work with a couple of the Planning Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12952)|
| 3:35:58| to make sure we have adequate input, not just staff, but some of the Planning Commissioners and their perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12958)|
| 3:36:04| So we have a process that seems to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12964)|
| 3:36:06| I haven't noted in one of my questions to Commissioner Schoomaker, is there a problem with our current process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12966)|
| 3:36:13| And I have not seen one in the four years I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12973)|
| 3:36:16| and I think we've done eight to ten ordinance amendments to address various aspects of our existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12976)|
| 3:36:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12983)|
| 3:36:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12986)|
| 3:36:27| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12987)|
| 3:36:30| I was going to call on Mr. Green, but he already came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| Okay, just going back to what I wrote down originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12994)|
| 3:36:37| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12997)|
| 3:36:38| Yeah, I just wanted to, Miss Roche, on one of our breaks, she had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=12998)|
| 3:36:43| I don't know why she couldn't stay for all the entertainment, but she had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13003)|
| 3:36:46| She just wanted to reiterate her previous comments from the beginning of the meeting in opposition of the measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13006)|
| 3:36:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13015)|
| 3:36:56| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13016)|
| 3:36:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| I was looking at this in a different way, and maybe I was wrong with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13020)|
| 3:37:05| but we had an instance not too long ago where there was an ordinance come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13025)|
| 3:37:09| and there was changing of the wording in that ordinance to include sidewalks and subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13029)|
| 3:37:15| which are approved throughout the county, and it didn't come from or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13035)|
| 3:37:22| It was already written in the ordinance, which they can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13042)|
| 3:37:25| and I thought this was addressing that kind of issue where you have something that's added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13045)|
| 3:37:32| that affects, say, a rural area more than it does inside the city, and I may have that wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13052)|
| 3:37:40| and Mr. Schoonmaker, I don't know if that was the intent or not, what you were wanting to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13060)|
| 3:37:47| Commissioner Bussler and Mr. Chairman, if I may address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13067)|
| 3:37:50| that was in the subdivision ordinance or subdivision regulations, which at the time that amendment was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13070)|
| 3:37:57| which came from the planning commission, not the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13077)|
| 3:38:01| I'll have to qualify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| We hope that the subdivision regulations did not have to come before this commission for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13083)|
| 3:38:10| Based on state legislation, that approval was only by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| But state legislation has been changed and now provides this body with the ability to review amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13094)|
| 3:38:21| to the subdivision regulations, but it was not the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13101)|
| 3:38:25| It was the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| Thank you for the clarification, but I thought that was addressing some of those issues, but again, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13107)|
| 3:38:34| Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13114)|
| 3:38:37| Well, I'll defer until I just want to make the final comments on where I was going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13117)|
| 3:38:43| Well, if you want to make the final, I know Commissioner Daley, I think you . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13123)|
| 3:38:46| I guess this is for the law director, and this will determine which way I go, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13126)|
| 3:38:52| Mr. King said that we may be, I'm not going to say violating, but the terms of the Tennessee annotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13132)|
| 3:39:00| or can we do this or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13140)|
| 3:39:02| Well, I'm not going to get into the policy end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13142)|
| 3:39:07| Mr. King is reading one particular aspect of how it can be initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13147)|
| 3:39:13| In our review, we looked at it and thought it could be initiated by you, it could be initiated by a taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13153)|
| 3:39:20| it could be initiated by NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| I understand his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13163)|
| 3:39:28| He has a good point, I mean, where he's coming from on some of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13168)|
| 3:39:32| but we'll be willing to defend any position you all take on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13172)|
| 3:39:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13179)|
| 3:39:42| Okay, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13182)|
| 3:39:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13184)|
| 3:39:47| First, this started out just as a simple housekeeping issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13187)|
| 3:39:54| I'm sorry that qualified individuals like Jennifer Roche with the Knoxville Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13194)|
| 3:40:03| and then Ashley Burnett with the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association got involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13203)|
| 3:40:09| and then the new president of the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13209)|
| 3:40:13| Homebuilders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| Homebuilders, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13215)|
| 3:40:19| Excuse me, you can tell it's after 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13219)|
| 3:40:22| Anyways, and in no way was this going to deny any individual the right to due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13222)|
| 3:40:29| nor was this going to carve out the NPC in any decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13229)|
| 3:40:34| This was simply looking at Section 6.30.02 to correct 12 words in this language to define who does what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13234)|
| 3:40:47| We were going to insert map amendments shall be initiated by filing an application with the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13247)|
| 3:40:54| and then text amendments, and the whole idea here was that if an individual, a group, a Homebuilders Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13254)|
| 3:41:04| a Realtors Board goes to the NPC director and staff and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13264)|
| 3:41:08| hey, we think that there needs to be a revision in XYZ zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13268)|
| 3:41:17| Those guys would then come to us and say, you know, we've had a request from the Homebuilders, the Realtors, an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13277)|
| 3:41:26| that hey, we need to address this because these haven't been updated since 1977.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13286)|
| 3:41:32| It gives us the option, one, to open the communication channel to say, oh, we didn't even know that was on the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13292)|
| 3:41:39| We think you should go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13299)|
| 3:41:42| There's not this process to deny anybody the opportunity to change a zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13302)|
| 3:41:48| It's just to say how does it all start, what the housekeeping issue is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13308)|
| 3:41:54| So they're still going to do their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| Nobody is cutting out the NPC from trying to do a zoning ordinance and their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13317)|
| 3:42:03| All we're saying is tell us what's on the radar screen, let us go ahead and say, hey, that's a fantastic idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13323)|
| 3:42:10| but maybe you should also do something else at the same time when you're working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13330)|
| 3:42:15| So that was the whole idea behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13335)|
| 3:42:19| This was not some big conspiracy behind the Iron Curtain or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13339)|
| 3:42:24| This was just a housekeeping issue, and I'm really sorry that so many of these individuals in our county took offense to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13344)|
| 3:42:32| But again, it was just a simple housekeeping issue, and I'll ask Gerald Green, if he wouldn't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| come to the podium and explain to this body how city council handles this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13358)|
| 3:42:46| If a member of the public requests an ordinance amendment, a city ordinance, there's no involvement by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13366)|
| 3:42:55| If one of the council members requests an amendment, there has to be a resolution by the full council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13375)|
| 3:43:01| and that was in response to council members coming to me individually and requesting an ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13381)|
| 3:43:08| and was getting to the point we couldn't manage them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13388)|
| 3:43:12| Because if one council member would ask to do two, another council member would ask to do one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13392)|
| 3:43:18| another council member to do three, and that was to manage the requests coming from city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13398)|
| 3:43:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13404)|
| 3:43:25| But again, all we're trying to do is just, you know, we keep saying we haven't revised anything since 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13405)|
| 3:43:32| I just saw this, and I thought, hey, that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| Map amendments one way, text amendments another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13414)|
| 3:43:38| Vote your conscience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13418)|
| 3:43:42| Okay, is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13422)|
| 3:43:46| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13426)|

| 3:43:54| Okay, I heard two aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13434)|
| 3:43:57| Could you do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13437)|
| 3:44:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13441)|
| 3:44:03| Starts with me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13443)|

| 3:44:53| Okay, I'll call it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13493)|
| 3:44:54| All right, before I announce the results, you beat me to the punch, does anybody wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13494)|
| 3:45:01| Okay, the noes have this on a vote of eight to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13501)|
| 3:45:06| It does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13506)|
| 3:45:08| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13508)|
| 3:45:11| Item number 41 is Resolution 904, Approving the Knox County Government 2019 Voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13511)|
| 3:45:18| Workforce Reduction Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13518)|
| 3:45:20| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13520)|
| 3:45:22| Okay, I have a motion for approval from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13522)|
| 3:45:26| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13526)|
| 3:45:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13527)|
| 3:45:28| Second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13528)|
| 3:45:29| All right, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13529)|
| 3:45:30| I see Commissioner Biggs' light is on, but I'll go ahead and call Mr. Caldwell up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13530)|
| 3:45:37| first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13537)|
| 3:45:38| Commissioner Biggs, you've got a question on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13538)|
| 3:45:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13542)|
| 3:45:44| I've actually asked Mr. Caldwell a couple of questions about this, but I've really been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13544)|
| 3:45:48| doing a little bit of digging into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13548)|
| 3:45:50| We did a buyout 18 months ago, and now we're scheduling to do another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| You know, I don't want to give the idea to everyone across Knox County that we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13555)|
| 3:46:00| going to continually do something like this every 18 months to two years or so, have kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| of a buyout situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| So, I started looking a little bit further into it of who the actual buyout is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13567)|
| 3:46:11| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13571)|
| 3:46:12| I'm going to send you some information, and I've come to realize that we have never done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13572)|
| 3:46:17| a buyout for the classified staff of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13577)|
| 3:46:21| The school just did a buyout for the certified teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13581)|
| 3:46:24| Knox County had a buyout 18 months ago for its employees, the sheriff's office, fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13584)|
| 3:46:30| etc., but there's not been anything done for the classifieds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13590)|
| 3:46:33| I actually contacted Super Thomas, and he told me over the weekend that he doesn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| anything like that on the horizon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13597)|
| 3:46:39| He doesn't know about anything as of right now for it, and there's nothing that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13599)|
| 3:46:44| really do on that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13604)|
| 3:46:47| So, I have a couple more questions, like are we going to have another buyout in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13607)|
| 3:46:53| two years, and basically if we have a roundabout number of how many people are going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13613)|
| 3:46:59| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13619)|
| 3:47:00| I know that the packets went out last week before we've even approved it, so if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13620)|
| 3:47:04| kind of a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13624)|
| 3:47:09| No, I don't really have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13629)|
| 3:47:10| I know that we sent out 920 some packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13630)|
| 3:47:15| I do not have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| I know that I think packets can be turned in maybe beginning tomorrow if this were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13637)|
| 3:47:21| pass, and so I think I estimated last Monday, I thought 35 to 45 was an estimate, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13641)|
| 3:47:35| I think I would stick with that estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| I don't have a way to gauge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13657)|
| 3:47:42| Surprisingly, people won't ask me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| They go to other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13664)|
| 3:47:46| I don't know, and so I know we have some people in my department that have expressed an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13666)|
| 3:47:54| It's not Perry, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13674)|
| 3:47:56| He doesn't qualify, but so I think that's the one thing, so I would say 35 to 45 would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13676)|
| 3:48:04| be my estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13684)|
| 3:48:07| I would tell you that as far as I'm concerned, there won't be one in the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13687)|
| 3:48:13| Ultimately, not always my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13693)|
| 3:48:16| That could be something that the mayor and or commission would like to do again, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13696)|
| 3:48:22| so I think there's a time frame for those to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13702)|
| 3:48:31| I think it's just looking at when that happens, and that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13711)|
| 3:48:35| I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| Mr. Chairman, if I may, I'd like to make a substitute motion, I guess, to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| for 30 days until we can get a better understanding from our fee office holders, as well as there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13722)|
| 3:48:48| other things to think about, like the lateral transfer program with the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13728)|
| 3:48:52| Office and the City of Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13732)|
| 3:48:54| I just don't want, because if I'm correct, I believe 18 months ago we expected a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13734)|
| 3:49:01| number, and we overshot by 25 to 30, and I would hate for something like that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13741)|
| 3:49:07| again right here at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13747)|
| 3:49:11| Okay, Commissioner Biggs has made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13751)|
| 3:49:15| Could you restate that substitute motion that you're bringing forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13755)|
| 3:49:18| I would like to defer it for 30 days until we can get a better result of the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13758)|
| 3:49:25| and how many people and how many results this is going to come with, with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13765)|
| 3:49:30| that are going to take this buyout and cap it, basically, at a specific amount so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13770)|
| 3:49:36| don't overshoot like we did last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13776)|
| 3:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13781)|
| 3:49:42| I guess, is there a second for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13782)|
| 3:49:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13785)|
| 3:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13786)|
| 3:49:47| There's a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13787)|
| 3:49:50| So the motion before us is now to defer this item for 30 days so that the fee offices can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13790)|
| 3:49:57| have a chance to review this in greater detail, just to, I guess, to summarize it a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13797)|
| 3:50:03| bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13803)|
| 3:50:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13804)|
| 3:50:05| Because, could we do that, Mr. Caldwell, to make sure that we're not like set a ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13805)|
| 3:50:09| I guess, is what you could say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| I don't think as a fee office or a department head you should be going to your employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13811)|
| 3:50:15| asking about this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| I think they've got to come to you because ultimately it's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13817)|
| 3:50:20| So I think to get a number, you're never going to get a number and it be truly a voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13820)|
| 3:50:27| program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13827)|
| 3:50:28| Then if you have somebody who feels like they're being coerced into taking this, then you run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13828)|
| 3:50:31| into other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13831)|
| 3:50:32| I think you're shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13832)|
| 3:50:34| But I think that would be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13834)|
| 3:50:36| And so I don't think you're ever going to get a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13836)|
| 3:50:40| And if you defer this for 30 days, then this whole program would have to change because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13840)|
| 3:50:45| the guidelines in here are set forth to take effect where insurance ends in December, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13845)|
| 3:50:52| is very important for us because that's when open enrollment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| And so if you do decide to defer, then we will have to create a new program or amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13855)|
| 3:51:04| this because it would change the amount of months that's available on health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13864)|
| 3:51:12| and we have to offset that somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13872)|
| 3:51:19| Okay, now we've got the second, I'm sorry, I see the law director's got his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13879)|
| 3:51:24| All right, I'm going to go ahead and call on Bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13884)|
| 3:51:29| I wanted to add one caveat that's in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13889)|
| 3:51:32| I don't think it may affect how you all think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13892)|
| 3:51:35| I don't care how you think about it, but I want you to understand that just because an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13895)|
| 3:51:41| organization may have X number that would like to take it, the final say will be with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13901)|
| 3:51:47| the manager saying I cannot lose 25 slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13907)|
| 3:51:51| So that won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| So there is going to be, as you'd say, like a governor or a regulator on this engine so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13913)|
| 3:51:59| that there will be a ceiling set somewhere by somebody based upon how many people apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13919)|
| 3:52:07| and they'll have to figure out how they're going to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13927)|
| 3:52:10| But some organizations can't lose a slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13930)|
| 3:52:13| Other organizations could lose five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| Some could lose ten and be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13935)|
| 3:52:18| So I think what Commissioner Biggs is looking at may be self-governed, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13938)|
| 3:52:26| Okay, before we vote, I want to recognize that I have had multiple lights come on on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13946)|
| 3:52:32| I've got Anders, Jay, Daly, Schoonmaker, and Carringer have all chimed in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13952)|
| 3:52:38| Some of your lights came on before the substitute motion had been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13958)|
| 3:52:41| So, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13961)|
| 3:52:49| Chris, we talked last week about numbers, and I think you and I had a phone conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13969)|
| 3:52:53| I appreciate the follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| We were going to get some exact savings numbers per what we saved per employee last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13975)|
| 3:53:03| Last time, it seems when this is not a policy, it's a practice, and practice becomes policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13983)|
| 3:53:12| Every couple of years, we offer this early buyout to try to find savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=13992)|
| 3:53:21| It kind of becomes the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| I mean, it's like TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14003)|
| 3:53:24| There's always an offer of a buyout at TVA every year or every two years or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14004)|
| 3:53:30| Early retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| I guess it saves us some money in health care costs, and it saves us some money in having some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14012)|
| 3:53:42| I'd really like to see the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14022)|
| 3:53:46| I didn't call any department heads out of respect for the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14026)|
| 3:53:49| but I did talk to some elected officials that run their own offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14029)|
| 3:53:54| Not very many of them had too many spots to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14034)|
| 3:53:58| I'm really concerned that we may just be doing this to help some folks on the way out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14038)|
| 3:54:03| and I don't think that's what this system should be set up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14043)|
| 3:54:10| I'm looking at the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14050)|
| 3:54:11| Why would the delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| It says employees can still turn in their packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14053)|
| 3:54:17| It says they don't turn them in until June 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14057)|
| 3:54:21| Why would it delay if we held off a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14061)|
| 3:54:25| The delay is you've got to give, by law, them a certain amount of time to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14065)|
| 3:54:30| and so we would have to delay the time it is for them to turn in their packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14070)|
| 3:54:41| If the commission doesn't pass this, we're going to send out an email and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14081)|
| 3:54:44| listen, did not pass, so the packets that were sent out are void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14084)|
| 3:54:49| because we've got to give them, I think it's 60 days is the time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14089)|
| 3:54:54| so I wouldn't want to drag them out for 30 more days without them knowing what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14094)|
| 3:54:59| We couldn't just delay that process 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14099)|
| 3:55:02| Because you're talking about insurance in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14102)|
| 3:55:04| That's an important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14104)|
| 3:55:06| We don't want to go through open enrollment with 30 employees just for like a month of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14106)|
| 3:55:14| It's kind of convoluted, and it's a very clean cutoff to do it in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14114)|
| 3:55:24| So last time they introduced this, we'd introduced it in January or February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14124)|
| 3:55:27| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14127)|
| 3:55:28| Why are we doing it this time this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14128)|
| 3:55:30| Because you're putting the commission at a rush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14130)|
| 3:55:34| and also if you send out the packet without approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14134)|
| 3:55:38| and then if we pull it back, it's the commission's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14138)|
| 3:55:40| It's not the mayor's office's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14140)|
| 3:55:43| I mean, just the timing of it is very hard to digest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14143)|
| 3:55:48| I mean, you've got new commissioners here that haven't done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14148)|
| 3:55:51| I mean, it's a totally different ballgame now, and the timing of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14151)|
| 3:55:56| you know, if it doesn't pass, it's our fault this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14156)|
| 3:55:59| Yeah, I don't think it would be blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14159)|
| 3:56:00| I think it's something that the mayor wanted to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| As far as the timing of it taking effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| it's the same time frame as it was the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14167)|
| 3:56:11| We gave the employees more time the previous program to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14171)|
| 3:56:17| so we gave them added time because it was the first time we've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14177)|
| 3:56:21| And so I don't think this is very uncommon for our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14181)|
| 3:56:25| I think if you would ask HR, they probably get calls about this a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14185)|
| 3:56:29| and probably haven't received a lot of phone calls in the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14189)|
| 3:56:32| asking if we're going to do this again or what's the process of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14192)|
| 3:56:36| And so, as you seem so, but it's rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14196)|
| 3:56:43| So the time frame is very tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14203)|
| 3:56:46| and we made it tight from the standpoint of we don't want to drag it out past December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14206)|
| 3:56:51| It's more clean as it relates to health insurance and tax purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| and 1095s and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14215)|
| 3:56:58| And so I think the program has been tweaked a little bit in some of the benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14218)|
| 3:57:05| but the program as a whole has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14225)|
| 3:57:17| Okay, any other follow-up questions for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| Okay, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| Mr. Caldwell, or maybe Commissioner Biggs, maybe you can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14243)|
| 3:57:26| You said something about overshooting the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14246)|
| 3:57:28| Can you explain what you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14248)|
| 3:57:30| So 18 months ago, we came in at wanting a specific amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14250)|
| 3:57:34| What was that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14254)|
| 3:57:36| Well, I think what you're referring to, I said I thought we'd have 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14256)|
| 3:57:40| and we ended up with 79.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14260)|
| 3:57:42| So I overshot my number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14262)|
| 3:57:44| I don't think we ever put a hard and fast number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14264)|
| 3:57:47| The estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14267)|
| 3:57:49| There was an abundance of people that we did not estimate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14269)|
| 3:57:52| My major concern was if we would have got this 30 days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14272)|
| 3:57:56| and could have looked a little further into it, I probably would have been fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| But given such the short notice and just the feel of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14279)|
| 3:58:04| I don't want it to be something that I feel like was just kind of sprawled on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14284)|
| 3:58:08| at the last minute and voted in, and then we regret it 30 days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14288)|
| 3:58:13| Mr. Caldwell, last time you all did this 18 months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14293)|
| 3:58:18| did you all send out the packets before it was voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14298)|
| 3:58:21| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14301)|
| 3:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| So that's a standard procedure to sort of send it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14303)|
| 3:58:26| and talk to people about it before it comes to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14306)|
| 3:58:28| So I think last time we sent it out to give employees more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14308)|
| 3:58:32| So this time it was related to the 60 days that has to be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14312)|
| 3:58:38| We had a group of individuals that worked on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14318)|
| 3:58:43| and we had to backtrack from what dates that we knew worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14323)|
| 3:58:48| And so the 60 days is built in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14328)|
| 3:58:52| but there's not a lot of room from the standpoint of if we went any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14332)|
| 3:58:58| we would have reduced it to four months of health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14338)|
| 3:59:02| and probably increased the payment to assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14342)|
| 3:59:07| Is that because there's a six-month COBRA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14347)|
| 3:59:11| This has five months. The previous plan had six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14351)|
| 3:59:15| Is there a requirement to have a certain amount of months of COBRA or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14355)|
| 3:59:18| or is that just part of the offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14358)|
| 3:59:20| It's part of the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14360)|
| 3:59:21| So the offer can go from two months to four months to six months to eight months to a year to whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14361)|
| 3:59:26| There's no legal statute that says you have to give X number of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14369)|
| 3:59:30| It's just all about the variables of the package and the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14370)|
| 3:59:32| It's what we think is a reasonable incentive to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14372)|
| 3:59:38| And my last question is you said several employees have asked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14378)|
| 3:59:42| or inquired about this over the last X number of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14382)|
| 3:59:45| Going to Commissioner Anders' comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14385)|
| 3:59:48| is it something people are going to retire anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14388)|
| 3:59:52| but they're looking for how do I hold on long enough to get to the next part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14392)|
| 3:59:55| where I can get a big check to walk out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14395)|
| 3:59:58| And, you know, are we incentivizing them to kind of wait to retire to get another check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14398)|
| 4:00:04| I mean, I feel like that might be a leading comment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14404)|
| 4:00:08| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14408)|
| 4:00:09| I think it's going to vary by employer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14409)|
| 4:00:13| So if we're very blunt about it, if we had a department head who had an employee who knew, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14413)|
| 4:00:28| they wanted to take this program, are they very productive now anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14428)|
| 4:00:34| I mean, so I think productivity does play a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14434)|
| 4:00:39| And so I'm not saying all employees are that way, but I think, you know, it's a variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14439)|
| 4:00:46| And so I think ultimately the program last time cost us $2.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14446)|
| 4:00:58| And we know that in year one we saved $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14458)|
| 4:01:02| And then that cost is ongoing for the most part, not all of it, but some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14462)|
| 4:01:06| And that doesn't include your savings on the health insurance side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| So I think the program has proven that it pays for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14470)|
| 4:01:16| And if you can find some efficiencies in government, that's always a positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14476)|
| 4:01:21| And I think I might want to ask department heads to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14481)|
| 4:01:27| but I think most would think that the last one was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14487)|
| 4:01:32| And I think employees have an interest because they see it as a way, as a benefit maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14492)|
| 4:01:41| for them to retire a year before they had thought about retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14501)|
| 4:01:46| I've often said that if you were within two years of retirement, this program may interest you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14506)|
| 4:01:53| If you're longer than two, it probably does not interest you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14513)|
| 4:01:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14519)|
| 4:02:00| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14520)|
| 4:02:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14523)|
| 4:02:04| Mr. Caldwell, if it's legal, can you limit the number to 35 or 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14524)|
| 4:02:11| Could you do that if it was legal that the first 30, 25 gets it and the rest don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14531)|
| 4:02:16| If that is legal, I don't know if that's legal or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14536)|
| 4:02:21| Well, I think the challenge with that is you're going to say first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14541)|
| 4:02:27| And I don't know if that's really the idea here is for them people to rush it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14547)|
| 4:02:34| I think if you have an interest, you should turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14554)|
| 4:02:38| And then we sit down with either a department head or an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14558)|
| 4:02:44| and go over each person who's turned in and let them make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14564)|
| 4:02:51| I think it's hard to put a number on it or even put a dollar amount on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14571)|
| 4:02:59| because ultimately it depends on who's in your pool, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14579)|
| 4:03:03| What's the average salary in that pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14583)|
| 4:03:08| We had one person that got it last time I think was a convenience center worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14588)|
| 4:03:15| So you take that and an individual's payout versus just maybe a doctor at the ME's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14595)|
| 4:03:27| It's not going to weigh the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| And so I think it's hard to try to put a cap as a number or a cap as a dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14611)|
| 4:03:39| And there are safeguards where a department head can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14619)|
| 4:03:44| no, we really need you there and so there is a safeguard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14624)|
| 4:03:49| Oh, they can say no, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14629)|
| 4:03:52| And to ask this question, would the mayor be willing to promise that the next three budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14632)|
| 4:04:00| that he would not offer another buyout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14640)|
| 4:04:03| The next three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14643)|
| 4:04:04| That's the mayor's question, but I mean you're talking for the mayor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14644)|
| 4:04:08| Yeah, I can't speak for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14648)|
| 4:04:12| Wow, that can get me in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14652)|
| 4:04:14| I can't speak for him. I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14654)|
| 4:04:18| He's not here still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| Okay, is that it, Commissioner Downing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14661)|
| 4:04:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14663)|
| 4:04:24| All right, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14664)|
| 4:04:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| Chris, and correct me if I'm wrong on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14667)|
| 4:04:31| but 18 months ago was the first time Knox County ever did an employee volunteer retirement buyout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14671)|
| 4:04:41| My knowledge, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14681)|
| 4:04:42| And we've been around for 200 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14682)|
| 4:04:45| And the way you can look at it too, it was at the tail end of a mayor's administration after eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14685)|
| 4:04:52| He didn't do it at the beginning of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14692)|
| 4:04:54| He did it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14694)|
| 4:04:55| So I would assume that because this was the mayor's idea to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14695)|
| 4:05:01| and we know that we're saving, what, $12 million just from the last buyout over the next three years, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14701)|
| 4:05:10| I think you can easily show the first year savings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14710)|
| 4:05:14| So you can show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14714)|
| 4:05:16| I think the difficult thing to calculate, there are ongoing savings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14716)|
| 4:05:21| I think what the part that we haven't calculated that I think is truly there is savings in health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14721)|
| 4:05:30| If you look at what we've paid in health insurance the last three years, it's pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14730)|
| 4:05:35| I think part of that can be attributed to some of that, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14735)|
| 4:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14739)|
| 4:05:40| So even $12 million, that's like half of a new school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14740)|
| 4:05:43| But anyways, and I would assume if the mayor's proposal didn't go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14743)|
| 4:05:50| then what's the incentive from next year or the following year or the year or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14750)|
| 4:05:54| how long his administration is, to ever do this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14754)|
| 4:05:57| So I just look at it as one administration did something at the end of their term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14757)|
| 4:06:04| and then somebody else is coming in and saying, hey, this is a great idea for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14764)|
| 4:06:09| It's going to save the taxpayers money going forward, and that's why they wanted to offer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14769)|
| 4:06:14| And you've already prepared the packets, and everything's ready to go for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14774)|
| 4:06:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14778)|
| 4:06:19| They've already received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14779)|
| 4:06:20| They've already received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14780)|
| 4:06:21| So if a member of this body wanted to delay us making a decision until the May meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14781)|
| 4:06:30| that still kind of stretches things a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14790)|
| 4:06:34| but we could actually have a special called meeting after our budget presentation on May 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14794)|
| 4:06:40| to decide if we wanted to move forward with this, if people didn't want to vote for this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14800)|
| 4:06:46| Yeah, I think, you know, to speak to what Commissioner Anderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14806)|
| 4:06:50| I mean, so you could defer for 30 days and just put everything on hold and not move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14810)|
| 4:06:58| and tell them to keep going as if it's going to pass, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14818)|
| 4:07:02| And so you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14822)|
| 4:07:04| I just hesitate to leave employees in limbo because not knowing what's going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14824)|
| 4:07:11| because then there could be some employees that would change their line of thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14831)|
| 4:07:18| I'm not saying that there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14838)|
| 4:07:19| I just think there could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| And so you could definitely delay for 30, and we could leave that in limbo until that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14841)|
| 4:07:30| and then basically they would have 30 days to turn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14850)|
| 4:07:34| They would have had it for 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14854)|
| 4:07:35| They would have 30, basically less than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14855)|
| 4:07:37| I think it's due the middle of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| And so you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| I mean, I think I would just recommend them understanding tomorrow that when packets could be turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14861)|
| 4:07:48| that they know for sure either way if it's a go or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14868)|
| 4:07:58| Any other follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14878)|
| 4:07:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14879)|
| 4:08:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14880)|
| 4:08:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14881)|
| 4:08:02| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14882)|
| 4:08:03| Commissioner Daley, you've got your light still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| Oh, you turned it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14887)|
| 4:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14888)|
| 4:08:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14889)|
| 4:08:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14890)|
| 4:08:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| Mr. Caldwell, I wanted to say, so the date is about mid-June before we'll know for sure how many have signed up for this offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14893)|
| 4:08:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14904)|
| 4:08:25| The deadline is June 21st, and they have seven days to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14905)|
| 4:08:32| To withdraw it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14912)|
| 4:08:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14913)|
| 4:08:34| So June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14914)|
| 4:08:37| From being on the insurance committee, I fully understand because we will start with getting here in just a couple months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14917)|
| 4:08:50| getting ready and all for open enrollment, which will start Christmas out there, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14930)|
| 4:08:56| Will it be 1st of October, mid-October, when we start having open enrollment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14936)|
| 4:09:03| But before then and all, we like to see, and with having Blue Cross Blue Shield this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14943)|
| 4:09:10| we're looking forward to having a much more accurate result of what's being used and what's not being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14950)|
| 4:09:19| what we need or what we don't need for our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| a much better communication and records that we've never been able to have before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14963)|
| 4:09:29| so that we need to see, with us being self-insured, if we need to adjust anything or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14969)|
| 4:09:37| Now, I think what we need to really emphasize tonight, and particularly to let the public know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14977)|
| 4:09:43| is that this can be offered, but it is up to the individual office holder as to who, if they okay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=14983)|
| 4:10:00| And the one thing we need to really let everybody know is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15000)|
| 4:10:04| and make sure I'm correct on this, or correct me if I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15004)|
| 4:10:08| that the last time, 18 months, when we offered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15008)|
| 4:10:13| if whoever put in for the retirement, that was a position in each of the Knox County offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15013)|
| 4:10:21| that that position cannot be replaced. That's still correct, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15021)|
| 4:10:27| That's correct. We actually, so just all full transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15027)|
| 4:10:32| Last time there was a total of 79. 74 were positions that were not replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15032)|
| 4:10:39| There were five that were approved that were special circumstances that varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15039)|
| 4:10:45| And that right there, I think, is the thing that we, as commissioners, need to realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15045)|
| 4:10:51| I believe that we have one of the best finance teams around, and I have a lot of confidence in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15051)|
| 4:11:01| And I don't think they would offer this if they didn't think there was a way that it was going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15061)|
| 4:11:10| and save Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15070)|
| 4:11:13| And I understand what Commissioner Biggs and Commissioner Anders, as far as delaying it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15073)|
| 4:11:20| But the main thing is, if that office holder cannot afford to lose that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15080)|
| 4:11:27| they're not going to allow them to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15087)|
| 4:11:30| And that's what I really want the public to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15090)|
| 4:11:34| We can offer this early retirement, but unless their supervisor, office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15094)|
| 4:11:44| can go without hiring somebody in their place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15104)|
| 4:11:48| And that was the thing, I think, that was so unique about this 18 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15108)|
| 4:11:55| And so that's still in effect, and I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15115)|
| 4:11:59| They cannot rehire someone to take that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15119)|
| 4:12:04| So, say, you know, say Ed Schaus, our trustee, has 10 people to apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15124)|
| 4:12:13| but I doubt that he could really say okay to 10 people because he wouldn't be able to replace that many positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15133)|
| 4:12:21| So I think that's the thing we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15141)|
| 4:12:23| We are being held accountable for it, and, you know, I want to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15143)|
| 4:12:31| I'd like to think that we have lots and lots of happy Knox County employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15151)|
| 4:12:36| and that we will not overshoot the projected number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15156)|
| 4:12:42| Do you have a projected number again, Chris, that you're thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15162)|
| 4:12:45| I think it's been said, but just to reiterate that projected number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15165)|
| 4:12:50| I'll say my number again and I'll be wrong, 35 to 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15170)|
| 4:12:55| So when I'm wrong, you can tell me I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15175)|
| 4:12:58| My staff likes to tell me I'm wrong all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15178)|
| 4:13:00| Yeah, but we don't like to because you're our numbers guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15180)|
| 4:13:02| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15182)|
| 4:13:03| And we like you to be right on the penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| So, okay, so you're thinking 35 to 45, and so of those 35 to 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15185)|
| 4:13:10| you all have looked at everything, and that's going to save us money if we don't go over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15190)|
| 4:13:20| And I know there's some departments, they can't even afford to lose one employee right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15200)|
| 4:13:26| Commissioner Carrington, I think if he overshoots, sorry for interrupting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15206)|
| 4:13:29| I think if he is off and overshoots the number again, we'll actually save more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15209)|
| 4:13:35| It grows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15215)|
| 4:13:38| Let me say this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15218)|
| 4:13:40| I was talking to Krista because she was involved in us in putting this program together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15220)|
| 4:13:46| I think her point's valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15226)|
| 4:13:47| I think that's why this date's on the thing that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15227)|
| 4:13:50| We say that the effective beginning date's April the 23rd, which is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15230)|
| 4:13:57| And the reason that's important is it's got to be an official offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15237)|
| 4:14:01| and officially offered would be approval of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15241)|
| 4:14:04| And that means the deadline to submit is June 21st, which is the 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15244)|
| 4:14:10| And so I think we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15250)|
| 4:14:13| So I retract what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| I think that your approval today does have a bearing on the 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15255)|
| 4:14:20| It can't just be, oh, it may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15260)|
| 4:14:22| It's got to officially be offered, and they have to have 60 days by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15262)|
| 4:14:28| If that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15268)|
| 4:14:30| Mr. Link is walking behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15270)|
| 4:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| Mr. Link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15273)|
| 4:14:40| So the mayor is watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15280)|
| 4:14:41| and he says that this would be the only time that he would offer this in his first term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15281)|
| 4:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15286)|
| 4:14:47| So, all right, back to, all right, Commissioner Carringer, you had the last questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15287)|
| 4:14:52| Yeah, I just wanted to make sure everybody knew that it goes back to the office holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15292)|
| 4:15:00| and that he or she cannot replace this employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15300)|
| 4:15:05| and they have the ultimate say-so as to whether or not they can take this retirement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15305)|
| 4:15:11| So I just wanted to make sure that I was clear on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15311)|
| 4:15:14| and that all the public was clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15314)|
| 4:15:19| Just because they want to take it doesn't mean they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15319)|
| 4:15:22| It has to be okayed by the office holder that's been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15322)|
| 4:15:26| It has to be approved by the boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15326)|
| 4:15:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15327)|
| 4:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15328)|
| 4:15:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15329)|
| 4:15:30| Looking at the lights on this to get us moving again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15330)|
| 4:15:32| Commissioner Biggs and Daly, and I see now Commissioner Gill, who wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15332)|
| 4:15:36| I don't think she's spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15336)|
| 4:15:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15337)|
| 4:15:38| Have you not spoken yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15338)|
| 4:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15339)|
| 4:15:40| Commissioner Bussler, your slide has been obviously spoken on this matter yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15340)|
| 4:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15343)|
| 4:15:44| I'll go ahead and call on Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15344)|
| 4:15:46| I want to make sure everybody's had a chance to weigh in in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15346)|
| 4:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15348)|
| 4:15:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15349)|
| 4:15:50| I worked in the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15350)|
| 4:15:52| and I worked for a company that offered this kind of buyout three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15352)|
| 4:15:57| The first time I was six years away from getting in that first group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15357)|
| 4:16:03| which was really upsetting to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15363)|
| 4:16:06| The next time I was six months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15366)|
| 4:16:10| But the last time when they offered it, I was there and I took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15370)|
| 4:16:14| The thing of it is it's done by management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15374)|
| 4:16:19| It's not done by committee to reduce the most controllable cost of any company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15379)|
| 4:16:27| and that's employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15387)|
| 4:16:30| What happens is if you can reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15390)|
| 4:16:33| and still get the functionality of the employees that you have, then it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15393)|
| 4:16:39| This thought of that you can't replace employees is a very bad idea to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15399)|
| 4:16:48| because everybody can be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15408)|
| 4:16:52| But you do offer your good employees an opportunity to enjoy what they work for a little bit sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15412)|
| 4:17:00| That's what I looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15420)|
| 4:17:03| We're talking about a good employee that may want to retire early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15423)|
| 4:17:06| to enjoy the work that they have done for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15426)|
| 4:17:09| and we're saying, well, we don't want to let you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15429)|
| 4:17:13| That's the employee's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| That's not our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| The chief executive officer is called the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15437)|
| 4:17:24| He's presented a thing to us that can save the county taxpayers dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15444)|
| 4:17:29| Is that correct, Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15449)|
| 4:17:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15452)|
| 4:17:34| The chief executive officer comes to his board of directors and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15454)|
| 4:17:38| we can save money, here's what we can do it, and here's what proves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15458)|
| 4:17:42| Mr. Caldwell thinks it's a good idea, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15462)|
| 4:17:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| So I've got to think about the man that handles the money and say, okay, I think he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15467)|
| 4:17:54| We might not like the employees leaving, but he says it's going to save us money, save taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15474)|
| 4:17:59| and that's what we're here for, to save taxpayers dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15479)|
| 4:18:02| or our fiduciary responsibilities to make it work cleaner, faster, and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15482)|
| 4:18:09| Maybe we could give a little raise to Chris to get a better looking tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15489)|
| 4:18:14| But anyway, that's the whole point of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15494)|
| 4:18:22| If you've not worked in a company that has one of these, you don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15502)|
| 4:18:26| It's to help save money and make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15506)|
| 4:18:29| This way we don't make money, but it does save the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15509)|
| 4:18:32| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15512)|
| 4:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15514)|
| 4:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15515)|
| 4:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15516)|
| 4:18:37| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15517)|
| 4:18:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15518)|
| 4:18:39| Let me say that I think the opportunity to give employees in government a higher degree of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15519)|
| 4:18:47| What I don't agree with is sometimes the lack of replacing those positions impacts the level of efficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15527)|
| 4:18:55| of county government services to be delivered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15535)|
| 4:18:58| But I also appreciate you could have senior employees who are ready to exit their service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15538)|
| 4:19:05| and we have the capacity to replace it with people who want to learn how county government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15545)|
| 4:19:12| So I appreciate the mix of both of those to make sure we have the staffing ratios that are correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15552)|
| 4:19:20| at a lower cost for new employees versus some of your senior employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15560)|
| 4:19:26| But the capacity of people accessing this program will determine where we are going to be long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15566)|
| 4:19:35| which is a positive thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15575)|
| 4:19:37| And it gives people flexibility to design their own life within that 60-day window to use this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15577)|
| 4:19:47| to the benefit of their families and wherever they see themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15587)|
| 4:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15592)|
| 4:19:53| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15593)|
| 4:19:54| I've got Biggs first brought this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15594)|
| 4:19:58| We've also got Daley and Anders that wanted to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15598)|
| 4:20:03| Commissioner Biggs, you made the original substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15603)|
| 4:20:05| Do you want to have the last word on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15605)|
| 4:20:07| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15607)|
| 4:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15608)|
| 4:20:09| Then I'll move to Daley, then Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15609)|
| 4:20:13| Chris, all 30-day delay would do would hamper the ones that want to do retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15613)|
| 4:20:19| It presses them to do something because when I retired, the closer it got to the time to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15619)|
| 4:20:25| I started thinking twice about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15625)|
| 4:20:27| So I don't think a 30-day delay here is necessary, and I'll be voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15627)|
| 4:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15633)|
| 4:20:34| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15634)|
| 4:20:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15635)|
| 4:20:36| Yeah, Chris, you and I had talked about positions and what had been hired and re-hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15636)|
| 4:20:41| and I was hoping to get a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15641)|
| 4:20:44| I think you and I had talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15644)|
| 4:20:45| but I don't know if we finalized the discussion about getting a list of positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15645)|
| 4:20:48| that were eliminated and brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15648)|
| 4:20:51| Looking at the previous two budgets, we say we eliminated 70-something positions, 74 positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15651)|
| 4:21:02| but looking at the last two budgets, we've increased our employment by 50 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15662)|
| 4:21:07| as the two adopted budgets, position by position on the budgeted position chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15667)|
| 4:21:13| Now, some of those you may have some county employees on the fee offices that are not in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15673)|
| 4:21:19| but how did we reduce by 70 and gain by 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15679)|
| 4:21:23| So let me speak to that, and I've got some spreadsheets I'll give to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15683)|
| 4:21:28| When you go back to the adopted budget of 18, which will not show up on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15688)|
| 4:21:36| but there were 18 positions given up by fee offices, which don't show up on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15696)|
| 4:21:45| And then we know that there was a reduction of 30 in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15705)|
| 4:21:50| The 18 budget, the position count will show 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15710)|
| 4:21:54| but that's because they have more for some positions and added eight back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15714)|
| 4:21:58| So when you count the 30 and the 18, there are 16 additional more in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15718)|
| 4:22:04| There's 11 in the health department, one in ADA, three in parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15724)|
| 4:22:11| I won't go through them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15731)|
| 4:22:12| And then there's also some in the public library fund, solid waste, and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15732)|
| 4:22:18| And so you do get to a total of 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15738)|
| 4:22:23| When you do go to 19 and to the county position count in the 19 budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15743)|
| 4:22:33| it would show in the general fund an increase of 39 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15753)|
| 4:22:38| Now 28 of that's in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15758)|
| 4:22:40| And we know that this week a little bit about six is in pretrial, six was in school security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15760)|
| 4:22:48| And they always, as people retire in the sheriff's office, they have historically always done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15768)|
| 4:22:56| They have always done things where they will take one position and morph it into two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15776)|
| 4:23:02| So when we see growth in their numbers, it's not related, I don't think, to this buyout plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15782)|
| 4:23:07| It's just how they would do on positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15787)|
| 4:23:12| They'll take a senior position and make two officers as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15792)|
| 4:23:16| And so the others, like you had two in attorney general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15796)|
| 4:23:19| So I don't think that I know where you're getting at with the 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15799)|
| 4:23:24| I think it's kind of unrelated to the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15804)|
| 4:23:28| just knowing that the majority of those are in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15808)|
| 4:23:32| And then we can track the 30 back to the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15812)|
| 4:23:36| And we know what they gave up for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15816)|
| 4:23:38| And we talked about that this week, about there were clerical positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15818)|
| 4:23:43| or jobs they hadn't used in a while that we pulled away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15823)|
| 4:23:46| And so I do agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15826)|
| 4:23:48| It's difficult to look at if you're just looking at adopted budgets and you don't have a historical look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15828)|
| 4:23:54| I've got this for you that I'll explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15834)|
| 4:24:01| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15841)|
| 4:24:03| Biggs, I know you wanted to finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15843)|
| 4:24:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15846)|
| 4:24:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15848)|
| 4:24:11| This past week I had a chance to do a little due diligence on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15851)|
| 4:24:15| and talk to Chris Caldwell about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15855)|
| 4:24:18| So my position is I'm going to vote against the delay of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15858)|
| 4:24:25| because I support this voluntary reduction in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15865)|
| 4:24:30| And I think that they've done their due diligence to figure out the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15870)|
| 4:24:35| what it's going to cost the county, how they have to handle the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15875)|
| 4:24:39| the extra incentive for the number of years service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15879)|
| 4:24:43| And we do have a 60-day requirement before that June 21st date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15883)|
| 4:24:49| And if we delay it, this all goes out the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15889)|
| 4:24:53| And there's no guarantee if we wait 30 days the mayor will continue on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15893)|
| 4:24:58| So I'm going to vote against the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15898)|
| 4:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15901)|
| 4:25:02| Commissioner Biggs to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15902)|
| 4:25:04| So basically all I was wanting to do was just get a little more light shed on this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15904)|
| 4:25:10| that I felt like was just kind of brought to us rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15910)|
| 4:25:14| You know, maybe I could just recommend that later if this happens again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15914)|
| 4:25:19| that it's brought to us so we can look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15919)|
| 4:25:21| and get the data that we need to make a better decision on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15921)|
| 4:25:26| I'm all for giving the employees an incentive that are the senior employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15926)|
| 4:25:31| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| But I just wanted a little bit longer time to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15933)|
| 4:25:36| and kind of make a more educated decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15936)|
| 4:25:39| I guess with that and hearing everyone talk, I'll just rescind my sub motion, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15939)|
| 4:25:44| And that means it goes back to the correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15944)|
| 4:25:47| That goes back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15947)|
| 4:25:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15949)|
| 4:25:50| And the second, is the second okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15950)|
| 4:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15952)|
| 4:25:53| So we are back to the original motion, which was for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15953)|
| 4:25:57| Who was the first and the second on the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15957)|
| 4:25:59| Bussler and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15959)|
| 4:26:00| Bussler and Gill were the original motions who moved for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15960)|
| 4:26:06| So that is what is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15966)|
| 4:26:08| Seeing no lights, I think we have talked this thoroughly, so I'd like to move to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15968)|
| 4:26:13| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15973)|
| 4:26:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15977)|
| 4:26:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15978)|
| 4:26:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15980)|
| 4:26:21| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15981)|
| 4:26:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=15982)|

| 4:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16017)|
| 4:26:58| It's an ordinance, so we do need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16018)|
| 4:27:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16020)|

| 4:28:21| charged of aggravated assault of a location I was not at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16101)|

| 4:29:18| I told her the house is bugged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16158)|
| 4:29:20| She stated there's a wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16160)|
| 4:29:22| She's wearing a wire on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16162)|
| 4:29:25| Any law enforcement, whether it's Knox County, State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16165)|
| 4:29:31| or the federal government, I've been harassed two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16171)|

| 4:29:42| My voice is loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16182)|
| 4:29:44| I am frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16184)|
| 4:29:46| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16186)|
| 4:29:47| If any kind of proof my mother thinks you're talking, people are going to think you're crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16187)|

| 4:30:01| I waited here this long, four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16201)|
| 4:30:04| I've been here since 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16204)|
| 4:30:06| It's 9 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16206)|
| 4:30:07| Roughly five hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16207)|
| 4:30:10| If it wasn't serious, I wouldn't wait this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16210)|
| 4:30:14| I don't know what the legal definition to murder is, if somebody picks up a gun and shoots someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16214)|
| 4:30:20| or someone harasses someone so much until they commit suicide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16220)|
| 4:30:24| What I heard is it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16224)|
| 4:30:27| I'm not going that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16227)|
| 4:30:30| The idea here is if there's enough ---- I've said this two years, two, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16230)|
| 4:30:35| When I start seeing F.E.S., anybody who's got an issue with me, knock on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16235)|
| 4:30:42| There's the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16242)|
| 4:30:44| That's what I expected out of this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16244)|
| 4:30:46| I was born in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16246)|
| 4:30:48| My father immigrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16248)|
| 4:30:49| My grandfather immigrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16249)|
| 4:30:52| I never thought I'd see the day that this country, this is how they play it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16252)|
| 4:30:58| And, yes, my voice is loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16258)|
| 4:31:01| I'm aggravated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16261)|
| 4:31:04| And it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16264)|
| 4:31:05| The day my wife left me, she indicated through sign language that she's wearing a wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16265)|
| 4:31:15| And if I find out which law agency this is, it's got to be breaking some kind of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16275)|
| 4:31:21| She wore that wire in every aspect of our lives, including a damn bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16281)|
| 4:31:27| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| I'd like to see the detective that put her up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16289)|
| 4:31:36| That's what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16296)|
| 4:31:38| I don't know how many of you are innocent of gang stalking or who knows about this and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16298)|
| 4:31:45| Everybody denies it, but we're all well aware that I never believed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16305)|
| 4:31:51| But once you see it, you'll learn to believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16311)|
| 4:31:57| Sir, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16317)|
| 4:32:00| The clerk's office, we want to make sure that we've got your appearance here documented accurately in our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16320)|

| 4:32:26| No, that was another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16346)|
| 4:32:30| Anyway, my attorney took it for free because he was defending other defendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16350)|
| 4:32:38| But I wasted a year and a half in that degree, that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16358)|
| 4:32:43| The name again is H-E-L-A-L John Zieta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16363)|
| 4:32:46| I'll leave the copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16366)|

| 4:33:05| You leave them down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16385)|

| 4:33:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16397)|
| 4:33:18| Was that only five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16398)|
| 4:33:19| It felt like two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16399)|
| 4:33:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16400)|

| 4:33:24| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16404)|
| 4:33:25| Anybody who's got an issue, there's a front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16405)|
| 4:33:29| Knock on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16409)|
| 4:33:31| And when you have the wife wearing a wire, I think it's outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16411)|
| 4:33:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16415)|
| 4:33:36| That must be very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16416)|
| 4:33:37| And I just appreciate your patience and wait until the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16417)|

| 4:33:46| might want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=16426)|
