| 0:03:12| Good to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| I literally just got back from Nashville about five minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| and I wanted to just share with you a little bit about my visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| I had meetings with the mayors of Chattanooga, Memphis, and Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| We met, the four of us, together with Governor Lee, Lieutenant Governor McNally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| and Speaker Cameron Sexton, and we went collectively, along with Jane Alves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| who represents us with the Tennessee Municipal League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| to talk about issues facing all four of our cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| and municipalities across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| There were good meetings, and in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| our message was focused on the need for support from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| for recurring revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| The one-time monies, we expressed our gratitude for the many things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| that they've brought to our cities, including Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| the help with the stadium and the one-time grant last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| that helped us with some other expenses, and that has been helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| But as you know, most of our expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| and needs are in the operating arena to pay our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| and address the labor market circumstances that we're facing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=261)|
| 0:04:29| So we shared that message with the Governor and Lieutenant Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| and Speaker Sexton in three separate meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| and had some good discussions, and no commitments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=277)|
| 0:04:42| I also was glad to reinforce the need, as you all expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| during the retreat last week, about help addressing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| surrounding drug addiction, mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| and how that also intersects with issues with our unhoused neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| So we had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| Again, no firm commitments on anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| but a shared commitment or understanding of how extreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| and acute those issues are and that cities can't handle it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| So that message was conveyed, and I also had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| to meet with some members of our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| who I saw either on the halls and just dropped in on coincidentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| but I sat in on the meeting with Senator Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| He's the chair of the state and local committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| And also I met with Senator Becky Duncan Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| who's the head of our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| and also the chair of the Transportation Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| which is a very important committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| So all in all, time well spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| and we will also be seeing members of our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| at the legislative breakfast a week from this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| So good stuff, and glad to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| to share Knoxville's needs with our state leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| So speaking of budgets and priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| you all know that this Friday I'm going to be sharing with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| the annual budget retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=370)|

| 0:06:15| and this retreat is the first big milestone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| as my team and I begin preparing a proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=381)|

| 0:06:26| and so have the rest of my staff putting together this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=386)|

| 0:12:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| It is for Centro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| It works along with our business expansion work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| to align with that but to give services directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| to our Latino-owned businesses that we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| don't have the ability to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| OK, so some of the services directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| that community will be coming from Centro Hispano| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| and you guys are kind of fostering and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| that happen, is that how it will get executed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=752)|

| 0:12:35| because we just have a bigger accounting team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So I guess the specifics of how it's going to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| or what they're going to be offering is through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| Centro Hispano, so is that more appropriate for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=765)|

| 0:12:49| OK, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=769)|

| 0:13:17| Yeah, this is a new initiative that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| with some support with different funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| from Comcast and AT&T last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| So what we did is we started really diving deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| into what the needs are with the Latino community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| and working with the clients that we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| We opened a registration for pre-registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| for the co-starters program, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| is what we're using along with the Entrepreneur's Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| and Call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| And so what we'll be using that curriculum for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| is we have three cohorts that launched last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| and we have a total of 33 participants who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| will go through that course, as well as offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| standalone workshops and technical support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| for those who are not in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| That's officially the co-starters curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| OK, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| I look forward to hearing more about how it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| going over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=836)|

| 0:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Any questions for Mr. Odom or Mr. Ledford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Any other questions or discussion about this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| Seeing no further questions, all those in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| 11B is a resolution authorizing the execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| of an agreement with the sports authority of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| of Knox and the city of Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| to undertake certain public infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| necessary or appropriate for the development of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| located on or around 400 East Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Council members, as you start your discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| I just want to say that this agreement is a critical step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| to help ensure that the stadium lives up to the expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| I've heard from so many people that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| excited for the stadium to connect seamlessly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| to downtown and surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| through beautiful, high-quality public spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| as well as functional, multimodal streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| And that's what this investment allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Through this infrastructure, which will all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| be for the benefit of the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| we're committing to achieving that vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| and making sure the area around the new stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| becomes a transformative asset to our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| and the entire community, much as Market Square is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Deputy Mayor Stephanie Welch and Engineering Director Harold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Canyon are here to address more detailed questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| In looking through this, this proposed investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| looks consistent with our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| in our previous workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| But I wanted to get some comment on the county's participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| in these infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Is this just the city's responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| or is there some shared responsibility here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Thanks, Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| So the city will front the funding for this infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| through our capital improvement budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| over the course of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| So we're committing, we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| you to commit through this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| But then you would see over the fiscal years of FY23 and FY24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| the funds in those budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Later this month, or early in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| you will see a resolution that will be going actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| both to city council and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| to amend that Magnolia Avenue redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| It would create a TIF district in which the new city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| and county property tax from the TIF district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| would go into paying for this infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| So that's the county's participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| This is a really great demonstration, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| of the county's commitment to every aspect of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| It benefits us because we're able to capture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| new property tax increment from redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| within that TIF district from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I forgot, I didn't realize someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| has signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| So Miss Parker, I'll call on that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| and then get to you, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| And I have other questions after the public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Just I wanted to ask about the TIF district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| if you could point to me where in this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| it outlines that the TIF payments will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| towards the infrastructure payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| Councilwoman Parker, that will be outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| in the Magnolia Avenue redevelopment plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| that will be coming to council at an upcoming meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| So currently what is before us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| would make the city completely liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| for the full cost of the public infrastructure agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| One person signed up to speak on this, Mr. Gary Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Mr. Lowe, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Is anyone seeing anybody stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| and look like Mr. Gary Lowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| OK, that concludes public forum on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Miss Parker, you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| Well, one question I had pertains to the exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1089)|
| 0:18:18| exhibit A in the back of this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| I'm trying to understand the footprint of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| What is highlighted in white is highlighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| the infrastructure, and then the shaded in portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| are both stadium and private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| Can you help me understand where the private development exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| within this footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| Yes, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| So exhibit A is intended to be part of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| to be very clear about what the public infrastructure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| I will do my best to talk about the private infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| which is not the intent of this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| or the private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| which is not the intent of this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| So there are basically two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| that are sort of the planned private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I think that Council has seen those at least twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| through the two readings that were brought to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| following the planned development amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| So you can always refer back to those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| I'll be happy to send them to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| But there are two buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| one on the west side of the gray shaded area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| and then there are, it looks like two structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| but it's really one building with an overpass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| that is on the east side along Florida Avenue, Florida Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| And that's within the public infrastructure plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1194)|
| 0:20:04| No, Councilwoman Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| the public plaza is shaded in white on the far left-hand side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| or the west side of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| And so when you say the Florida Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| the private development along Florida Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| are you talking about the structure outlined to the left in our diagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| or is it towards Campbell Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| There are exhibits that would be much better representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| of the whole site that were part of the planned development amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| that came to Council over two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| That may be a better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| This is really intended to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| where the public infrastructure is as part of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| Right, and for the vote tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| so I can better understand what we are funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| through the public infrastructure upgrades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| it looks as if it would be the frontage of this private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| would be this public plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| It's an integrated site, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| So just as with many sort of mixed-use urban style developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| just as you would see on Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| you have a whole market that is fronting privately-owned buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| but it's a big public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| So if you think of that as a potential comparable example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| where there's public infrastructure, a big public amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| and private investment that's all happening in one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| that is very typical of an urban style development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and that's the intent of the planned development amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| that Council approved over two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| I think just last month or the month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And so for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| the intention is that the city would foot the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| for all infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| that serve both the stadium and private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| and the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Yes, these are all public streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| public plazas that are currently public streets as they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| This would be a new public plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Just as they serve the community now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| and serve the property that abuts the public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| they will do that through this redevelopment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| And then the completion of the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| can be undertaken by both the city and the stadium developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1367)|
| 0:22:55| it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| It seems that for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| just as with any project that the city pursues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| there should be a competitive bidding process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and we should not actually set aside work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| for the stadium developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| just to meet the stadium developer's deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| Ms. Parker, the law director wanted to shed some light on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| With regard to the public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| there still will need to be a competitive process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| just like there is with any infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| but sometimes, and this happens in a number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| there is a contractor already involved in another project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| who's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| and if they can prove to our engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| that they can accomplish those infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| for at least 10% less than another contractor could do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| then we allow a cost reimbursement contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and that's within our procurement code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| and within the state procurement code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| We do that on a relatively regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and this contract provides that we have to adhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| to the requirements of the competitive bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| And a concern I have with that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| which I understand has been used perhaps regularly previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| but for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| we've made a promise to the city, to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| that the development of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| will not only benefit members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| in terms of the economic development opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| but particularly that we would recruit directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| from the most impacted communities in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| when it comes to disparities in our, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| essentially our construction industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| but in our public contracting particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| and this is a $14 million opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| to create more opportunities for workers in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| and I'm concerned about that being less of a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| than the deadline the stadium developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| has set for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1545)|

| 0:26:33| the Nickel Road specifically in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| what exactly is being done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| in the 5,500 block of Nickel Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| This work is, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1601)|

| 0:26:47| This was the emergency work that we did at Thanksgiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| to repair the edge that had fallen off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1610)|

| 0:26:55| and I'll commend Rogers Group for the promptness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| that they took that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1620)|

| 0:27:08| I know that there were so many issues on Nickel Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| and so many people pulled together to help them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| and I know we have more going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| but that was a great example of the community speaking up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and then the city working together to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1640)|

| 0:28:28| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| I'm not sure if this is a question for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| or if it's a question for Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| I see this is the fire station there at Jacksburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| and this is for the design work specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| What is the schedule for when the work would be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| I'm assuming probably the next fiscal budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| future capital budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| Chief Sharp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Yes, it will still take a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| There is money already set aside in the current capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| but there will need to be some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| so it probably won't get started until the next budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| I was going to say, I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Did you say next year would be when the work might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Yes, most likely it won't start until the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| We'll look forward to seeing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| and maybe seeing the new station when it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| And just for a little context, Chief Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| this is part of a broader program where we maintain our stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and renovate them as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Could you just describe that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Yes, we've been doing this for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| This will actually be our sixth station that we have renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| We were originally hoping to do about one per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| It's taking a little bit longer than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| so we're getting one done about every year and a half or every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| But, again, this is the sixth one that we've renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| We've made significant improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| and just made them a lot more livable and even more energy efficient also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| Just for the big picture, how many stations do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| Nineteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Nineteen total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| And this is about the sixth in that capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| We started with the oldest stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| the two that were actually built in the 30s or in that general time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| and now we're working on the 1960s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| the ones that were built in the 1960s and trying to get them renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you, Chief Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Item 8 is an ordinance amending Chapter 4, Article 1 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| so as to allow distribution of beer or alcoholic beverages at Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| by holders of server permits issued by the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1854)|

| 0:31:04| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| So if there is an event at Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| and somebody is planning on selling beer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| will they still be coming in front of the beer board to get a permit to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| or is that automatic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Lakeshore Park, there's an organization that governs it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| so they would have to go through the steps with that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| I do not think they would be coming back to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| and it's generally for weddings and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| This doesn't prohibit them from selling beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| but it's generally for smaller events and when they're having weddings, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1906)|
| 0:31:56| Okay, so being used as a smaller venue, but how about larger public events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| I don't think they have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| I could pull it up, but I don't want to rhyme the meeting to a halt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| and it would have to come back on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| I could find out the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Okay, that's a concern of mine because I feel like the beer board has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| whenever there's an event and someone comes in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| they've had to go through, they've had conversations with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| they've gone through a plan for their server compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| and I like that little bit of conversation before a new group is going to be selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1951)|
| 0:32:40| I understand for small weddings or if there's a venue there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| but for larger events, I don't want to take away the role of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| That's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Well, I think I just answered my own question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Mr. McAdams was supposed to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Yeah, and Mr. Frost, you can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| So virtually what this does, so currently there is, say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| an approved list of caterers that can cater within Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| and some of those caterers already have an off-premise alcohol permit where they can serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| What this does is open the options because there are other third-party vendors out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2002)|
| 0:33:28| that, say, do nothing but serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| They don't cater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| They come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| They're ABC licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| So it's not beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| I mean, that's state issued at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| And so what this does is just open up the options so those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| be it a wedding or a special event or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| aren't relegated to just a short list of caterers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| They can have any caterer, and then they can hire a third party to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| and serve the alcohol that's licensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| So if there was going to be, I don't know, let's say an Indian festival out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| and there was a nonprofit who was sponsoring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| and they were going to be the ones selling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| Then it would be like a special event permit for both the beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and then if they serve alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| then they go through the Tennessee Alcohol Commission through the state to get that licensing as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| or that permit, special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| I found the ordinance is a two-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| The organization must have a Lakeshore Park facilities use agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2067)|

| 0:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| So it's not changing procedure at the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Council, there's also, I believe someone, Juliana's here from Lakeshore Park Conservancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| If you want to come to the podium and speak to these issues that Council's asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| we'd appreciate it if you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| Hi, I'm Julianne Foy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| I'm the executive director for Lakeshore Park Conservancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| And in response to your question, Councilman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| any event that they're selling alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| they would still have to go before the beer board to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| This is really pertaining to smaller events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| As Councilman Frost said, the weddings and nonprofit organizations that are having events, ticketed events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2120)|
| 0:35:30| any of those, but anything that, any event where they are selling alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| they would still have to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Thank you, Ms. Foy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| Ms. Parker, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I was just wondering if this was unique to Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| or if we have other parks where this type of arrangement's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| I'm not, Councilmember Parker, I'm not aware of another park that operates with a group such as Ms. Foy's here to represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2152)|
| 0:36:06| I do know that there's a discussion, or has been a discussion, about the possibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| should this be considered on a wider city basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| There were some initial conversations with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| PBA has expressed some concerns about it that we're going to try to talk through potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| But in the meantime, I guess if you wanted to consider this a pilot project, you might consider it a pilot project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2196)|

| 0:37:32| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Well, I was confused a bit about the next few ordinances and understanding what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2253)|
| 0:37:42| to close a sliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Is it still a right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Is it still an open roadway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Can you help me understand what it means to close a sliver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| I'm going to ask Amy Brooks, Director of Planning, to speak to that for us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| This would be the same answer for C, D, E, and F, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| You know, same general premise, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| It would no longer be considered a public right-of-way once you close it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| So, why are we closing a sliver instead of the whole road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| I would defer to the engineering department or someone with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| This specifically came from the city as an applicant, and it's related to the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2304)|
| 0:38:33| Mr. Cannon, I know this is all related to the stadium project, and this has probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| been your department that has helped make this recommendation, so if you could explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| it to us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| That area in general has had some unique features as far as right-of-way, old property lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| We have closed the portions of the right-of-way that are necessary for this project to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| and where it's not necessary, out of respect to this process and city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| we've allowed portions to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| So that's the sliver part, is trying to clear up some of these property lines that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| for the project to go forward, and that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| I believe Mr. Swanson said, I'm not sure what the legal definition of sliver is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| but there is just small strips that had to be addressed to clean up the property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| It's a term of art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| And so I can't remember which roads we closed, but is this a road that we've already closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| and now this sliver helps with the property lines, or what happens to the rest of the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Some adjoin it, some do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| And the best example I can give you is the first creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| It turns out that that creek was a part of city property, and we didn't know it until we got into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| and that's why you closed that particular right-of-way, as we called it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| It's the same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| These are things that are popping up, just trying to make sure that the deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| and property issues are as clean as – are cleaned, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| I won't say as possible are clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| And they have had a lot of research go into these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| And the good news is that when you close these slivers, they are utilized as part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| but when you close these slivers, they go back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| So they're part of what's considered as taxable property once we've closed the public right-of-way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| I guess what I'm still confused on is if there is an area still within the responsibility of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2442)|
| 0:40:53| to maintain within this right-of-way, or former right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Those portions remain as part of the city because that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| and I can't speak to the specifics of the design at this moment, and I apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| But there are areas that will remain part of that right-of-way that will be a part of the streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| the infrastructure upgrades that you all voted on earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| There was no reason to close that portion because the city is still going to retain that area as public space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| And it's just – it's the finessing of the design into an area that has very old established right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| And it will be a public space with public access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| It will have public use, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| It may be access, it may be use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| It will be public property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| I just wanted to state that in our packet on page 207,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| there's actually a comment section there that does provide a little bit more context around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| because the term sliver was relatively new, I think, to all of us upon first getting our packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| And so there's a few more comments there that might be more helpful as well to Council Member Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| and anyone else that has some additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2528)|

| 0:42:15| I just was going to – this conversation has led to confusion and needing clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| In our packet for agenda item 12C that we're currently discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| if you open up the MPC packet on the third page of the MPC packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| it shows that all it's doing is narrowing Florida Street because it looks like –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| I can't say the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| When things protrude into the street from a structure, what do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2561)|

| 0:42:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2572)|

| 0:42:54| It encroaches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| It's going to encroach into the street, so the sliver is to narrow the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| So the roadway, if you look at the packet, is still open from Jackson to Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| It's just slightly narrowed because the stadium comes over a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| So that's the sliver, and it's in the MPC packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| But it sounds like it's not an open roadway for cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| It's narrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| I'm just trying to understand the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| The road just gets skinny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| The road will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| In the area that Councilwoman Ryder is speaking to, the road itself will remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| There's a portion of that right-of-way that is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| I don't know that I would call it a road diet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| but I would definitely call it a part of the streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| In that example, for Florida, there will be two-way traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| That's one of the things we made sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| That's what I was trying to clarify with my questions about public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| Will there still be a right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2631)|

| 0:46:02| Director Brooks, just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| There was some notes in the packet about some discussion about notice from the neighborhood regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| I guess, could you briefly review the notice that planning goes through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| and then whether or not you follow the same procedure here as you would otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Certainly, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| So, planning staff has a robust noticing process that we undertake for all of our applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| and this one was no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| So, planning staff notified all property owners within 300 feet of the subject property via a mail postcard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| that's delivered to the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| Staff posted a sign on the subject property as well in advance of the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| That's posted no later than 12 days before the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| A public notice was published in the Sentinel 30 days prior to the planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| and, again, in advance of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| In addition to that, we also have a planning cases page that hopefully some of you are familiar with on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| and this provides access to the application, which also includes applicant contact information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| as well as a staff contact to learn more about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220208?start=2836)|
