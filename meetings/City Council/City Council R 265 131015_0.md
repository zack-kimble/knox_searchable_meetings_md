| 0:01:30| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| I'd like to have item 12B postponed until January 21st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=96)|
| 0:01:45| That's on the green codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| We're still working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=109)|
| 0:01:50| So we have a motion and a second to postpone the green code, 12B, which has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| the green code, until January 21st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=115)|
| 0:02:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I'd like to postpone 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| That is the brewery wine tasting and assorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| We need to postpone that until December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| They need to do a little work on that to make it go smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| So if we could postpone that until December 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| We have a motion and a second to postpone 12C, dealing with the small breweries, until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=144)|
| 0:02:33| December 10th, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| That is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| Any items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Now we're to consent items 12K through 12N, R202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| And the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| For the mayor's report, a few of you were here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| We had the ribbon cutting for the official opening of the State Street Garage expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=183)|
| 0:03:11| We have a great new pedestrian walkway going from the garage over to the side of the movie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| theater to get you onto Gay Street, without having to walk down and then go back up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| across the street and go back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| It means we won't have to pay for those escalators that don't like to work all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| And it also gives us an additional 240 spaces, a new deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| And the big part about this is that not only do we have that new deck and those new spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| but we also can build two to three decks in the future when the market demands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| And there's also the foundation is now strong enough to where we can add additional floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| for residential or office or whatever the need might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| So I particularly want to thank Bill Lyons and our downtown coordinator, Rick Emmett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| and his blog, who really helped keep everybody informed through the process, which was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| We also want to thank all the contractors, architects, all the folks involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| But most importantly, the neighbors around there, the businesses and the theaters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| such that put up with the construction mess during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| It's paid off, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| We've got a great new expanded garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Also today, this afternoon, a few of us were at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| They opened a new courtyard there next to the CARM building on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| This is a really lovely place with chairs and places, umbrellas to get in from under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=277)|
| 0:04:45| the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| There are electrical outlets where people can charge their phone or charge their wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| There are bathrooms, and there's places to store bags and, you know, luggage and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=292)|
| 0:04:59| So this will help, whereas a lot of their clients had to stay out on the sidewalk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| There wasn't a place for them to go during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| They can now come into this courtyard, be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| You know, they're predators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| They are victims often of predators that are out there after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| And so they now have a safe place to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| There's also a concession stand, a concession area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| So if another church or group that would like to come and help provide them with meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| help CARM out on that, there'll be places to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| There's also a nice little stage area, and a band was playing as we had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| So congratulations to CARM and all of their supporters who made that possible to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| to serve those in need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Also I think you all probably heard that the Henley Bridge will be partially reopened this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| Thursday at 12.01 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| I'll wait to see it to more like 7 a.m., but it will be open in one lane in each direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| And so there's not going to be a celebration at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| The state's going to wait until they get the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| There's still going to be construction around there, but at least there'll be a lane in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| each direction that will be open, and those of us who cross that every morning will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| glad to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| And I also just want to give a final shout out to Jesse Mayshark and all of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| who were involved with the Centennial Conservation Expo, which was held last Saturday in commemoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| of the first National Conservation Expo that Knoxville hosted at Chilhowee Park 100 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| A lot of great organizations participated, and it really helped raise awareness about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Knoxville's role in the past in conservation, and also really helped highlight what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| doing to make sure that we continue to be a leader in terms of conservation and environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| So thanks to everybody who participated in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=417)|

| 0:07:01| Mayor, I just wanted to say I know you'd like to recognize there were a group of Boy Scouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| that you can't see them from where you're sitting, but let us recognize a group of Boy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=430)|

| 0:07:45| Nine A's, an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| southwest side of Old Wise Garber Road from A1 and F1 to O1 and F1 on the north side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| the creek only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Metro Knoxville HMALLC applicant, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| Okay, we have several people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| We've got one, two, three, four, looks like, oh no, six people signed up against this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=487)|
| 0:08:17| the rezoning, and there are, am I right, four people, no, three people, yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=497)|
| 0:08:26| Three people signed up for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| So I want to look to council to see what you want to do about the numbers because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| time limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Mayor, one of the things we might do is suspend the rules and have each side, just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| and give each side 15 minutes each and let them decide who is really going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| Some may want to talk for only two minutes, some may want to talk for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| I know council, we've been inundated over the last, I don't know how many weeks over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| The last couple of weeks has been very strong in terms of telephone calls and e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| And what I'm most interested in is if we have some new information as opposed to what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| heard over the last six or eight weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| So one of my recommendations might be that we go ahead and allow each side to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| 15 minutes that we normally do, but let them decide how they want to break up the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| of people that want to talk on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Yes, can you see my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Well, I was going to say that we have a lot of people that obviously came out and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| interested in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| And I would think that we would have the normal rules of 15 minutes per side in terms of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| able to speak with three speakers, but that we would allow additional speakers with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| shorter time and ask them to add new information to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| But I think in respect to the people that have obviously spent a lot of time and effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| to get here and feel like this is a very important issue, that we should allow additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| time, say a minute and a half, for the individuals who think there's something left to say and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| can't get it in the 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| I'll amend his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| You're amending it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| To allow additional time beyond 15 minutes a side so that's a minute and a half for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| additional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Did you make a motion, Councilman Grave, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| He suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| He was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Any other discussion maybe on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Who's the lightest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| So who's going to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I'll go ahead and make that motion that we go with the 15 minutes and then additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| speakers for a minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| So we will do the three speakers for up to five minutes each and then any additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| I think that's how we did it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Any additional speakers would get how much time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| A minute and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| You guys are going to make me figure that one out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| I'll give you five seconds, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I'll get this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Does everybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| This is a motion to suspend the rules to allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| That's what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| So we start with those who are signed up for the rezoning and that is in this, you'll come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=660)|
| 0:11:17| up in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Dr. Melanie Robinson, Dr. John Simmons and John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| And then just so you know, the others who signed up, you all can decide, I guess, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| are the three that will speak up for five minutes and then the other will have a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| And those individuals are Charlotte Davis, Shirley Bunting, Rocky Swingle, Jamie Rowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=697)|
| 0:11:46| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Syria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Syria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Syria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| And Virginia Pitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| So if you all would decide how much time you're going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Otherwise, we'll just start and go down the row, I guess, the first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| Ms. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| And please, when you all come up, please remember to state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| And I have the lovely job of being timekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| And I'll try and give you a warning as you're getting close to your end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| We actually will just use two of our slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| And we think that we have said what we need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| So we'll limit it to two slots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I'm Melanie Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I'm here representing Tenova Healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| My business address is 200 East Blount Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| And I'm a lifelong resident of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| With me tonight are other Tenova associates, along with the architect for the proposed project and our legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=753)|
| 0:12:40| I would like to recognize those who have taken their time to be with us tonight and express their support with their presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| So if you're here to support the project, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=766)|
| 0:12:53| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| We're here tonight to seek your approval for O1 zoning for our proposed site on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| This comes to you with unanimous approval from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| and with City Council's approval following the first reading and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| During the City Council workshop held on August 29th, as well as the first reading of this proposal on September 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| we shared with you the case for this project as well as the steps that we have taken to date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| in order to do this project in a responsible way in partnership with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| You heard from physician leaders as well as long-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| Dr. Simmons will follow me and express the support of the medical staff for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| We will not repeat each of those supporting arguments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| You have heard our reasoning and will respect your time and refrain from presenting those same facts again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| I do want to specifically address a few items that have been stated publicly about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| because we think it's important that you know the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| It has been said that our intention is to abandon North Knoxville and the current Physicians Regional Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| That is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| We have invested over $150 million in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| We continue to invest in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| We are actively developing plans and partnerships that will leave needed services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| and a presence on the Physicians Regional Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| We will continue to keep you updated as those plans fully develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| It has been stated that we do not need the rezoning in order to build a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and a medical office building on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| Our understanding of the legal status is that we do need to rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| in order to be ensured that we can construct a medical office building adjacent to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| which is critical to our ability to provide physician presence and outpatient services on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| MPC agrees and explained that position to you in the last reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| It's been stated that Tenova is planning to use this rezoning as a means to raise the value of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| and that if we're unsuccessful in obtaining our certificate of need to build the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| that we'll simply build a medical office building on the property or resell the property to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| That is false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| The only purpose of this rezoning request is to develop the land for a replacement hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| and medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| In fact, we currently hold an option on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| We have not yet purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| We will only purchase it and build the hospital if we are approved to construct a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| and medical office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Tenova, its physicians, and its patients need a replacement hospital for Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| We thank you for the opportunity to present the facts to you again this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| I will close by reminding you that this is a question of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| The City of Knoxville has previously determined that the subject property should be properly utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| for office purposes as shown in the one-year and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| In its review, MPC unanimously voted to approve the O1 zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| We ask that you once again confirm and approve that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| We thank you for your consideration, and we respectfully ask for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Now, Dr. Simmons, John Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=966)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you very much for listening to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| I was here the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| John Simmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| My work address is 112 Wise Harbor Road, and I reside at 3530 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| And as I mentioned, the last time I practiced here a long time, exclusively pretty much at St. Mary's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=992)|
| 0:16:41| I worked with Abercrombie Radiology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And Abercrombie Radiology has been with the original St. Mary's since its inception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| when Eugene Abercrombie started his practice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| So we've been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| We're very committed to it, and it's been a wonderful place to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| The medical staff now is somewhere around 300 active physicians and 500 or so courtesy staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1020)|
| 0:17:07| And it was said previously by some people that don't believe what the physicians have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| because they're employed by Tenova, and they're going to say whatever Tenova says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| The vast majority of us are actually independent, and we practice where we would like to practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| and where we think we can take the best care of patients in the best way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| And for years we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| It's become increasingly difficult to attract staff and patients to our aging facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| That's just the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| And because of that, we have looked at other strategies over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| Even before the Baptist merger, when we were St. Mary's, we were looking at relocation strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| We looked at a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And that got put on the back burner when we did the Baptist merger because financial issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| When Tenova came on board, we very strongly as a medical staff encouraged them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| almost demanded that they look at relocation strategies because where we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| we could see it was not going to be adequate for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| So we have looked east, west, south, north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| We've worked hand in hand with Tenova to try to come up with the best strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| We feel like this is an excellent strategy for us and our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| And we are just about unanimous in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Every active physician I have talked to is in support of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| and we strongly encourage you to vote to rezone this piece of land so that we can get on with the mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| of taking care of our patients the best way we know how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| So you're not going to speak, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| I'll yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| We'll hold it and see whether there's a need for a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Well, now's your time, and then otherwise you'll just have to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Then I'll yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Mr. Swingle, do you want to tell me who's going to speak at the five minutes and otherwise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Rocky Swingle, 7213 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| It will be me, Jamie Rowe, Shirley Bunting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| Those will be the first three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Charlotte, Jenny, and I've lost track of who the last person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Before I start, I'd like to ask all those who came in support of what I'm going to say to stand up and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1193)|
| 0:20:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| The vote you're about to take is a momentous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| It will affect Knoxville's health care system for decades to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Some say this is just a rezoning vote unrelated to Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| Some say, consider that the only reason we're here tonight is because Tenova requested a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| If the vote were unrelated to Tenova, you would have voted at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| Instead, at their request, you delayed the vote for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| You have Tenova documents that show the new hospital in your agenda packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Tenova has spoken about the replacement plan at prior council meetings on this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| There was a council workshop devoted to the hospital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Some of your own statements at the last vote show this rezoning request is obviously about the Tenova plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1250)|
| 0:21:00| Some of those comments were, and I'm paraphrasing here, a new hospital is better than a big box store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| This is a big development that will bring tax revenue to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| North Knoxville will have other developments to replace St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I'm not here to argue those statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| My point in bringing them up is that by making them, you're saying this vote is about the Tenova plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| So you're not voting solely on the rezoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| It is certainly linked to Tenova's St. Mary's replacement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| The municipal code says that a rezoning must pass the adverse effect test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| It says rezoning, quote, shall not adversely affect any other part of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| nor shall any direct or indirect adverse effects result from such rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| This application fails the adverse effect test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| How else can you classify the virtual closing of a hospital that serves north and east Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| How else can you classify the negative impacts on west Knoxville that you've heard over and over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| A no vote will not violate the owner's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| Property owners have a right to build within the limitations of the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| They have a right to ask for a zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| They have a right to have their request fairly and thoroughly considered by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| But they don't have a right to get a rezoning simply because they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| Rezoning or the refusal to do so is not a denial of a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| It is simply city council doing its job by applying certain criteria and making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| Rezoning isn't necessary at all, and certainly not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| We don't even know if there will be new owners of HMA, the parent company of Tenova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| We don't know who will be the management and board controlling HMA next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| or even if anyone will go forward and build a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Let Tenova get their CON first, their certificate of need, then come back with a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| Some criticize the fact that there's opposition from people who don't want the hospital in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| The only time there is opposition to any rezoning is because of the negative impact it would have on the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| who are most directly affected by the development, those who live closest to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and who will be affected by traffic, noise, lights, construction, loss of natural habitat and animals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| all of which will affect their quality of life and devalue their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| If you want to talk about the rights of property owners, let's talk about the hundreds of people in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| and those who live across Middlebrook who definitely will feel the negative impact of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Speaking of traffic, where is the traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| It's not on their website, Tenova's website, months after they said it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| It's not in tonight's online agenda packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| And why hasn't a second study been done by Tenova, either with or without the city's participation in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| It's unreasonable to vote on this rezoning without a thorough traffic study of more than just Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| A few modifications on Middlebrook will not help the people of West Hills with the cut-through traffic on all the major streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| A look at a street map and common sense tells you that all of the through streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| and the streets that feed them will carry heavier traffic as people try to find their way to and from Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| Not every car and ambulance is going to travel on Wise Garber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| That can't be disputed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| And there's no way to close off access from Middlebrook to those surrounding streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Plus, there is nothing to be done to deal with the fact that there are two major schools that turn Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| and Vanoisdale Road into one big traffic jam at various times during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| not to mention the heavy rush hour traffic already on Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Regardless of how you vote tonight, this issue will go before the MPC for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| and to the state for a certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| We'll be there to contest it, but this is your final opportunity to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| As you have said, you can't force Tenova to do anything, but you can tell them what you think is best for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| I urge you to support what's best for the citizens of Knoxville as a whole and vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| This is Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Some councilmen see this as a land use issue only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| And with present agricultural zoning, the hospital can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| And regarding accessory use, with all due respect, the building, the chief building official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1525)|
| 0:25:34| not MPC, makes that determination of appropriate accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| The building official's decision can be appealed to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| BZA's decision can be appealed to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| So you, this council, are the ultimate deciders about accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| And the situation, it was discussed last time, this situation is not at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| not at all remotely like the funeral home accessory use of a crematory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| That decision was based on an interpretation of state law regarding crematories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| And in this case, you have very compelling arguments for a physician's office building as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| First, every single hospital in Knoxville, without exception, has a physician's office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1584)|
| 0:26:33| And also, a physician's office building meets every single criteria in our zoning ordinance for accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| It is customary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It is incidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| And it is subordinate to the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| The property will be more valuable if it's rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Even the present property owners or the heirs are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and have said so about a higher assessment for taxes with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| I'm going to mention the traffic study that Mr. Swingle mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| But Mr. Greve had referred to that study at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| but yet the neighborhoods have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And evidently some of the council people haven't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| And I could not find a copy in the full agenda package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| At a recent council meeting, one councilman asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| don't we always honor petitions from a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Yet a petition was given to you at the last meeting with 700 names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| and they were opposed to this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| We've always depended on council to be consistent, using the same criteria when they make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1668)|
| 0:27:57| Most of you on first reading expressed wanting to stay neutral about the building of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| But by voting for the rezoning, you are putting your fingerprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| your okay, your endorsement, your stamp of approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| as well as your vote representing many citizens across the city who are opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| It gives Tenova a decided advantage as they apply for a certificate of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| The bottom line is Tenova can build this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| and the physician's office building under the present zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Please allow the certificate of need to be determined only on its own merits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1727)|
| 0:28:54| without the support of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you, Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| Ms. Shirley Bunting, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1745)|
| 0:29:17| My questions about this will be far simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| I'm Shirley Bunting, 7313 Toxaway Drive, and I am north of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| My concerns about this are that not enough environmental work has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1772)|
| 0:29:40| Has anybody ever addressed what is underneath the ground in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| This is a high cave area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Is there any way to prove that any kind of a structure of this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| will be appropriate for the land that is underneath it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| There has not been enough study done on what will happen if there is water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| That's an agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| If you put blacktop and a building all over that and a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| what's going to happen when you get a hard, hard rain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And we have had a few of those of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| These are the kind of questions that I have that I don't think have been addressed by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| I could be mistaken, but I have not read them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| and these are some of the issues that I would like some discussion on about the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1827)|
| 0:30:34| and what is underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| We don't want to be like what happened to Baptist Hospital many, many, many, many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| when it was in South Knoxville, and they got in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and discovered that they had a cave system under that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| that they had to fill with concrete before they could ever get the building off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| And hence, the building never was what they had hoped that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| because the upper floors did not get built as appropriately as the lower ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| I don't think that we need to have an issue like that come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| And has there been any kind of a study as to what's underneath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Because this entire area is honeycombed with caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| And I will submit any time that I might have left over to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you very much, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Okay, we're now on to Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1898)|
| 0:31:49| Thank you for being here, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| My name is Charlotte Davis, and I reside at 104 Crawford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| I'm here to ask those of you who voted to allow the rezoning of the property on Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| to reconsider your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Some of you gave us your reason that property rights should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| This issue goes far beyond property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| If property rights was always the deciding issue on requests that are heard by MPC and by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| then there would be no question what the outcome of voting would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| The casualty of permitting this rezoning to happen is the eventual demise of St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| As one member of council was quoted as saying in reference to Baptist Hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| a vacant hospital is a depressing sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| Some of you made reference to the help that the South Knoxville redevelopment would be to struggling merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| I do not disagree with either of these points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| but why can you not apply these same points plus others to the eventual demise of St. Mary's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| That vacant hospital will also be a depressing sight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| and merchants in the vicinity of St. Mary's will be left struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| Interestingly, a local business with longtime ties to St. Mary's was approached about eight months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| with the suggestion that they look for property on Middlebrook Pike so that they could follow their move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2005)|
| 0:33:34| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| I think I gave you extra time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| This move will affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I'm almost through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| This move will affect many people who will be left critically underserved for their hospital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| For those who voted yes for this rezoning, please reconsider your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| Okay, Virginia Pitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| My name is Virginia Pitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I reside at 7439 Westridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| I'm on the Benosdale Inn, and I am certainly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| I know about the traffic for the Benosdale and Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| It's well within where the school is, just a few houses down from the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| But what I want to really talk about is the ad about the Dowell Springs complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2077)|
| 0:34:49| which just started after this Tenova thing came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| That is a nine-to-five complex, and if you ever go over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| you will know that there are a lot of buildings that are empty and that the FBI takes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2103)|
| 0:35:14| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| That area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| And I think that that is something that should be taken into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| because they keep talking about Dowell Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| It's totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| But thank you for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you very much, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| And our last speaker is Pat Serio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Pat Serio, 7431 Westridge Drive in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| The first matter I want to address is environmental stewardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| I have taken the following excerpts from an Episcopal conference on environmental stewardship entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| A Pastoral Teaching from the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church, Quito, Ecuador, September 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| And they are excerpts since I have very little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Christians cannot be indifferent to global warming, pollution, natural resource depletion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| species extinctions, and habitat destruction, all of which threaten life on our planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| Because so many of these threats are driven by greed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| we must also actively seek to create more compassionate and sustainable economies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| that support the well-being of all God's creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| If we cannot live in harmony with the earth, we will not live in harmony with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| This is the appointed time for all God's children to work for the common goal of renewing the earth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| as a hospitable abode for the flourishing of all life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| We are called to speak and act on behalf of God's good creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| The church prays regularly for the peace of the whole world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| for seasonal weather and an abundance of the fruits of the earth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| for a just sharing of resources, and for the safety of all who suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| This includes our partner creatures, animals, birds, and fish who are being killed or made sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| by the long-term effects of deforestation, oil spills, and a host of other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| in which we intentionally and unintentionally destroy or poison their habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| I'm sorry, ma'am, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| Okay, council, that ends the folks who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| Mayor, no doubt this has been an extremely difficult decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| an extremely difficult situation that all of my colleagues and I have dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| but I am going to go ahead and make a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| I know that we have all spoken to this question, and we don't need to belabor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| but there is one thing I wanted to call to my brethren's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and that is there's a sort of a passing of the buck going on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| because when this matter was before the MPC and they were voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| several people threw up their hands and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| well, we're just the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| and we're here to look at the land use and we don't know nothing about no hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| and they didn't use that phrasing, but that's what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| I'm going to read from Michael Caine who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I will support the motion to rezone to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| My personal opinion is I ask city council to really look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and really determine whether or not there's a need for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| because I do think there will be significant impact to the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| particularly north of Knoxville and also to some degree to the West Hills area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| And he goes on in speaking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| But the point is they thought they would defer that question to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| which has a policy mission in addition to any technical viewing of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| And so I think we really shouldn't limit ourselves to, oh, gosh, it's a land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Can we put an office on a piece of property that's near a big road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| I mean, I think that's an easy one to answer, and maybe some of you answered it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| But this is a pretty dramatic effect on the community, and it has been said at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| and I think it's true, no one can make Tenova practice its medicine where we want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| But we don't have to go the extra mile before we have some determination on the certificate of need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| and I do think this body has to look at the health of this whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| maybe even explore options that would make the existing site more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| And I ask you not to put blinders on and to be the public stewards that you've been elected to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2394)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I'd like to reiterate a few of the points I made the last time we discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| This rezoning, in my opinion, is premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| It could drastically impact many people who live and work north and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| We don't know what the future holds for HMA or, if required by CHS or another entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| what they might want to do with Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| One option is to expand Tenova North to allow for decompression and renovation of Physicians Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| These state-approved plans are viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| This could save the company up to $100 million versus building a new hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| Physicians Regional is needed right where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| This is the second busiest emergency room in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Clearly a hospital is needed north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Let Tenova get the certificate of need on its own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Supporting this rezoning, I believe, is not for the greater good of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| especially those negatively affected north and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Supporting renovation of Physicians Regional is the way to serve those that need it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| I support hospital development in Knoxville, but it needs to be economically feasible, necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| and contribute to the orderly development of health care in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| So let's let the state decide that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| So is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| We have a motion and a second to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Mayor, I just wanted to, just as I announced last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| I'll be abstaining due to the conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| Ms. Mitchell, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2508)|

| 0:41:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| The motion passes five to three and one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| I'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| 11A is a resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| to consider and make a recommendation to city council regarding the possible addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| to the zoning ordinance by potentially adding definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| and to consider the appropriate zoning districts for their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Councilman Campin, is your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| with the Tennessee Housing Development Agency to become a servicer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| in the Hardest Hit Fund Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| 11C is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation if necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| of a fee simple interest in certain property located at 117 Rose Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| believed to be owned by David Erskine Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| at an estimated cost of $42,000 as recommended by the Chronic Problem Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Yeah, I just wanted to, I guess, commend Becky and the folks that she worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| including the hearing officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| This is an example of one of the properties that have blight and issues that don't get resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| and we have now mechanisms in place where we can put down an order, direct them to repair and fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| and if not, then further steps to protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| And, Becky, you may want to add something to that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| the moral is that a bad apple can spoil the barrel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| and we don't want to see our neighborhoods get run down and damaged by a bad apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| But tell us a little bit about this property, just to emphasize what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| This property is located in Fountain City, and it's been blighted, it's been vacant since 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| and been a blighting influence on the neighborhood for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| It has quite a few codes, violations, dirty lots, vehicles, structure issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2654)|
| 0:44:23| Also, it's in arrears and taxes, and we have negotiated with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| He is willing to sell the property to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Of course, all the liens and the taxes will come out of his proceeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| but this will turn out to be a very good outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| We'll list this property in Homeacres and resell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Hey, Becky, I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| What's the next step there as far as, you know, putting it into the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| and then how do people just go to bid on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Once we purchase the property, it will be listed in our Homeacres listing, which is online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Anyone can apply to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| There is an application, Homeacres application online as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| and that's at the city of Knoxville development website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2725)|

| 0:46:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| If Christy could maybe just for the record explain what this money is going to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| I know that a number of people in my area as well as the city are interested in what we're spending the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| so if she could get us some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Ms. Branscom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Christy Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| The first step in this process is, of course, to determine what is in those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| so we'll be engaging QE2 to do an environmental survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| and an assessment of any hazardous materials that may be in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| They will then help us prepare a scope of work for the demolition contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| and then they will also be providing project management services during the actual demolition of the abandoned structures at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2833)|
| 0:47:22| Christy, are these mostly the cottages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| We'll be looking at Waterside, Village Mall, which are some of the larger structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| and then there will also be several cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| So this is a study to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| This is a study to consider all of those structures out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And then you'll have a priority in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Exactly, and then we'll have a priority based on which projects we want to take down first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| and the cottages will probably be some of the last buildings that we will take down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2868)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Governor Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| I'll try here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Christy, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| We spent the first round a couple meetings ago, we spent a million dollars to assess the one historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2875)|
| 0:48:05| Yeah, that wasn't just for assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| That was to enter a contract for the restoration of the historic administration building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| So that will include some renovation to that building then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Oh, yes, and actually QE2 will also be doing some of the evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| and assessment of the HazMat in that administration building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| before we do the actual work that you guys voted on at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| which was for the actual restoration of the admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Okay, so does this contract include doing any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| It includes no demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| It's just HazMat remediation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| But does it include the study of that historic building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, it does as a part of the complete scope of services that QE2 will be providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| It's not only for the buildings that will be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| It's also to evaluate the administration building before we begin the restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Okay, and it's looking at the entire property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| I mean, you're trying to do phase one on not just the buildings, but land, other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2945)|
| 0:49:13| We're not going to necessarily be doing environmental studies of the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| the actual ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| We're doing the evaluation of the actual structures out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| because you have to take all that hazardous materials out of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| before you can do the demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| You've got some underground storage tanks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| We think we might have a couple of places where we have underground storage tanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| We're still investigating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| So will that be included in this $600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| That will probably be a separate contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| We're still evaluating exactly what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| So if there are underground storage tanks found?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| Then we would have to come back, and we might engage QE2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| but there would probably be another process where we would bid that work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| because it is a little more specific type work than what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| You answered part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| It doesn't have any of the actual demolition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| but it studies sort of how to get there in terms of hazardous materials and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Do we have any idea how much money will be involved in the actual takedown demolition work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| We're in the process right now of developing our estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| We did do some preliminary estimates, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and that's how we came up with that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| I think it was $5.4 million that was in the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| And so we did base that number on some preliminary estimates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| but as you know, when you go out to bid, numbers can be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| so we're hoping we get better numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| So that's your ballpark and you hope to beat it is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| We hope to beat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Yeah, we do hope to beat it, but it's hard to say until it's actually out there in bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3045)|
| 0:50:51| You might ask Chief Sharp if he'd like to do some fire testing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| some of those buildings, maybe a good training ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| If there weren't hazardous materials in there, I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Well, you can take those out first and then burn them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| A motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| 11G is an initial resolution authorizing the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| to borrow funds in an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $32 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| through the issuance of its general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Yeah, I see that we have Jim York here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| and I did spend some of his time today getting an understanding of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| but it's not the easiest thing to grasp at first glance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| And so since this item and the one following it are kind of sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| I thought we might take that on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| Jim, first off, this first resolution, 11G, is to get the proper, what, legal notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| the resolution of intent so that the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| or at least the taxpayers know we're about to go out and have a bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Jim York, finance director of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| The answer is the first piece is the initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| This is the first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| It announces again to the public that we plan on issuing debt up to $32 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3134)|
| 0:52:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| It starts a 20-day period during which a petition could be filed to request a referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3144)|
| 0:52:32| Again, this is the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| The second piece and the companion piece that will follow is the actual bond resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| which puts a lot more meat on the bone, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and it lays out some of the parameters of the potential bond issue and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| Let's stick to the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| The thing that caught my eye was that it said, I guess if you're a person, a citizen who's opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| that you have 20 days from the date of publication to get a petition signed by 10 percent of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3179)|
| 0:53:06| And you informed me that was sort of following the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| But as I understand the numbers, there are 105,446 registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| So someone would have to run out in 20 days and get 10,544 signatures, which probably is near impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| But this is a legal process we must go through, and so we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| And presumably, you know, no one will raise, you know, the ewe and cry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| but that's the process that's in place in our city and our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| The initial resolution, you know, again, sets that process in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| And that is the process that is set out in state law in terms of issuing debt and allowing for referendum on the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3220)|
| 0:53:51| I'll ask you to stand by and we'll get the mayor to get us to vote on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| and then we'll take the second piece in order, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| This has to be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3263)|
| 0:54:24| Now 11H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| 11H is a resolution authorizing the city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| to borrow funds in an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $32 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| through the issuance of its general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| So now we can focus on the second aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| which is actually to authorize the bond issuing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| I guess that would await the 20 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| but this would actually allow the mayor to execute the documents to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| in essence, putting general obligation bonds on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| Tell us briefly, I guess, just about the amortization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| because I thought it was really interesting how you explained, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| I personally hate borrowing money and having more debt for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| but how you explained with that chart in the back and the amortization schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| how you're trying to ease the burden on the city by doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| because I think that is very interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| and I think the taxpayers would want to know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I'm looking at page 192, the actual schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| What we have before you is one type of amortization schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| This is what we would call a back-loaded amortization schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| It takes the entire existing debt of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| and then layers this additional $32 million on top of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| and tries to level out the entire what would be roughly $201 million in debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| and amortize that on a fairly level schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| That is one way to approach the amortization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| and that's the one we have, again, listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| The other alternative is, again, what you would typically see in some sort of mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| and it would be what we would call a level amortization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| which would be, in this case, somewhere on the order of $2.2 to $2.3 million each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3376)|
| 0:56:24| that we would just, again, layer on the existing debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| That would result in us having higher debt, higher total debt payments in the first few years, lower in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3387)|
| 0:56:40| The first method, again, tends to equalize those over each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| so you'll have relatively level payments over the life of all the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| And I think that's the core of what I was trying to get you to tell us about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| and I give you, you know, great kudos or however my friend says it over here, to have looked at this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3416)|
| 0:57:08| because what you're saying is we have existing debt that's being paid down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| and will drop off the schedules in two or three years, in six years, in ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| and you're trying to have this amortization set up so that we end up paying a little less up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| while those are still on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| But as they come off the books, we can pick up the payments on the tail end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| and so we don't really increase the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| The debt service burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| We might increase the amount of debt the city has, but we don't increase the burden each year on the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| Is that a fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| I mean, it's approximate, but is that a fair approach to what you're trying to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Well, I appreciate that, and I think it's very interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| and I applaud that you have worked very hard to try to protect the taxpayers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| So kudos to Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| That's our new phrase, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3480)|
| 0:58:01| Kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| 21 kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| One question, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| So the debt would be how long would that debt roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Again, this debt that we have laid out, this proposed structure, is for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| So in 20 years, when it is really high, we won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| That's what you'll be sounding like in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| That's right, and we won't be here to answer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| I think you've got to worry about the 20 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| I think it's important that we go ahead and itemize what projects this is intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| We talked about it at a previous meeting, but we've got a building that's coming on into the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| Lake Shore, but let's spell out what the items are where we're spending the $32 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Again, what we have laid out before you is a very, very broad ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| and it has done that for very specific reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| The larger projects that we are talking about is the public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| That's on the order of $15 million plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| Lake Shore, $5.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| The Prosser Road redevelopment, that's roughly $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| And then we discussed some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| We're going to probably have to do some workarounds on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| and that's why we've made this very broad in nature to give us the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Again, you always draft these bond resolutions very broadly to give you that flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| because we have not gone to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| We have not yet worked out the entire cash flow needs on all these projects and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| and so we have to have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| In terms of when we will actually hit the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| we will probably not hit the market until spring of 2014 at the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| One important piece of this ordinance, and the other one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| is what we officially call the resolution of intent, and that is the piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| It's actually Item 12B in this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| but that gives us the authority to expend funds prior to issuing the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| in repaying ourself with future bond proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| And so the intent is, again, to cash flow the initial short-term cash needs out of existing revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3631)|
| 1:00:39| and then once we issue the bonds, we will repay those funds that have provided that cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3639)|
| 1:00:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Yeah, I guess I'd be remiss if I don't mention one more thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| and that is Section 7 of this draft form document he was talking about that would, in essence, be either an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3652)|
| 1:01:01| or a bond, maybe it's a bond covenant, but on Page 183 of your package, agenda package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| And that is that because this is a genuine, excuse me, I can't even say it, general revenue bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| that means the city is pledging its full faith in credit and, in essence, authorizes in this process that it will levy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| and collect a tax in order to pay the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| I mean, that's the obligation we take on, and that gives, what, assurance to the bond purchasers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| and the municipal bond buyers that this is something that's going to result in repayment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3693)|
| 1:01:41| and they have to assess our credit worthiness and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| But we are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| By doing this process, we, in essence, covenant, I guess, with the bondholders to raise the taxes needed to pay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| And that's why I think your earlier explanation is important, and that is that we're trying to structure it so that we fit it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| within the existing scheme we have of how we pay our debt service so we don't have spikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| and valleys and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Again, these are what we call general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| They do carry the full faith and credit of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| And, again, there isn't an obligation that you will provide sufficient revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| and do whatever it takes to pay off the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| And, again, as we put everything together, we're going to look at everything to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and minimize the cost of this entire issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| So we may end up with some slight structural variations on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| But, again, as we get closer to market, we'll be able to figure those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| We'll figure out, again, what our total cash flow needs are, when those will come on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and, again, be able to do those things because we seek to minimize our total interest cost on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| And we're paying what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Three, four percent of the property tax revenue goes to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| Isn't that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3789)|
| 1:03:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| And so I was bringing these points out just because we may understand it as we read these papers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| or ask questions, but the taxpayers, I'm sure, are as puckered as I was when I see us wanting to issue this amount of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| It's a huge amount of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| And no one wants to get overburdened with debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| And so we've got to be careful as we act on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| And I think full disclosure is important to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3811)|

| 1:05:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Kristi and I had a conversation this afternoon about this particular item and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| for her maybe to give some additional information in terms of why we're going this route and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| why we're using PBA like we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Well, PBA was established to help both the city and county with their project management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| needs and the coordination of the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| The city does have an existing contract with the PBA for project management and pursuant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| to that existing contract, we pay anywhere from two and a half to three and a half percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| of the project budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Our experience has been very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| We've had very good project management services by PBA and they do provide those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3948)|
| 1:05:54| at a reasonable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| In this particular case, PBA will be managing a construction manager at risk process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3956)|
| 1:06:02| delivering the Public Works Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| And Jeff Gallion is also here with PBA if you have any other additional questions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| PBA directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Another question that I do have that we also discussed, it's my understanding that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| contract with the architect will be, it won't be with the city, but it will be with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| It will be with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| And that contract has been negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Of course, it has not been executed pending the vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| And I think the other thing, you mentioned that the fee to PBA will be anywhere from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| two and a half to three and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| And I think council needs to realize that we're looking at a fee of about $450,000 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| we, as the city, are paying for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| And sometimes, and again, Christy, we discussed this, I know that some of my colleagues in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| the architectural profession have brought up whether or not we go out for an RFQ on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| something like this instead of just automatically giving PBA, you know, such a large fee for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| I'm not saying that the work's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| I'm just saying that I think all of us need to realize that a three percent fee is $450,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| And with the situation and the economy the way it is, that is taking work away from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4032)|
| 1:07:18| potential people that could provide professional services to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| So I just think we ought to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| And I would like to ask, since Jeff is here, Jeff, you want to explain a little bit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| detail about the kinds of services you are going to offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Jeff Gallion, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| We do manage the design and construction of the entire project and then all of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| provided services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| PBA is not really receiving a fee of three percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| We have a fixed amount of money for our department that's split between the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| depending on what the use is by each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| For instance, if the city was doing $10 million in projects and the county was doing $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| in projects, they would split that equally, so 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| So our fee for our department is not increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| We're not bringing on any more staff to manage these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| So we're not getting $450,000 to do this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| And what's the three percent fee then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| That's an estimate of the value depending on how much work we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| The more work we do, the less that percentage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| So right now I think we're doing about, just finishing up State Street, close to $25 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4122)|
| 1:08:51| $30 million in contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| Again, our fee is a set fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| It's not a percentage of each project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And that's charged on an annual basis to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| So what is the city paying you per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| It varies depending on how much work we do for the city and how much we do for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Just to clarify, we annually fund PBA at a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| At the end of the year we do a reconciliation with PBA based on how much we have used PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| And Jim York can probably provide a better explanation to help you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4163)|
| 1:09:28| The answer, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Okay, PBA's project management is somewhere on the order of $650,000 to $700,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| That's for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| That's for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| That's for PBA project management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| And, again, the percentage that we spend depends on the type of number of projects and the value of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4185)|
| 1:09:54| So, for example, let's say that there was a $10 million worth of projects for the city, $10 million for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4194)|
| 1:10:02| Then that total, $650,000, would be split 50-50 between the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| If, for example, we have 20, they have 10, then we would pick up 66% of that cost and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| The way this is structured, actually the more projects we add to PBA's workload,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| it actually drives down the percentage split in terms of management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| So, with this project, what we'll do is ineffective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| It will probably have an effective rate somewhere on the order of, I'd say, maybe 1% instead of 2% to 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4235)|
| 1:10:43| And, again, it depends on the number of projects that we have PBA managing for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| It's kind of a unique structure that we've done to finance the project management capabilities for PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| The other thing that happens is it provides us some additional ways to manage the procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| and the construction process and to utilize this construction manager at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| which we think will actually end up saving us money on the overall cost of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| So, by having PBA manage the project for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| it gives us a little bit better opportunity to take advantages of that particular approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| I think the construction manager at risk is definitely the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| I think part of it is, and by giving this explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| it really explains to my colleagues exactly what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| because I think the feeling was that we're giving another contract of $450,000 to PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4297)|
| 1:11:43| which could be, if it's out on the open market, might be something different on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| So that was part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| The other question I have to Jeff is that with this particular project or any other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| do you see hiring any more people for PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| In the past we've done, we did the transit center, and that was a $29 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| We did Hardin Valley, which was a $50 million project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| and Powell Middle School, which was about $19 million, all with the staff we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| So we don't anticipate any needs for additional staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And the reason I bring this up is last night at the League of Women Voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| it was brought up about minorities and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| And I think that one thing that the city needs to do is they need to set the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| and set the standards of being able to hire minority firms and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| And I would hope that PBA, in your consideration of going through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| would look to that in terms of what firms might be out there that you might be able to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| and whether or not it's for PBA itself or for this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| And we certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| We conduct pre-construction meetings for minority and small businesses to bring them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| and show them what the packages are that we're developing for the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| and break the packages up into smaller components so they are able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| And we're very proud of our record with the city providing minority participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| I think last year we were around 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| I know in the past you folks have done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| I just want to see it encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| And the construction manager at risks, that delivery method allows us to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| where we can actually have a choice about who the subcontractors are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| And then, again, breaking it up into small packages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Councilman Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| I'm almost hesitant to ask, but I have just a small footnote question here for Christy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| This is a $15.7 million project as estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| Our engineering team is, in essence, building a house for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| And I hope that we'll encourage whatever outside designers we have to make sure we're not gold-plating inadvertently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| because we like the best for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| And, too, that there's some kind of value engineering so that someone comes up with ways to perhaps build this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| that saves some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And I know that you'll be rigorous about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| But I think that's important that we don't conflict ourselves into trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| A couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| It's not just engineering, but it will also be public service that will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| It will also be fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| We're also trying to figure out if we can move the sign and the signal shop over to have everyone more centrally located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| to be able to provide our services more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| I think we're looking at every possible way that we can make this building as efficient as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| And I think Councilman Grieve alluded to this earlier, trying to set the stage and set the bar for how to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| as efficiently as possible in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| If we can set the example, you know, that's the best scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| We will be working very closely with PBA, and we'll be very involved in making sure that we look at every possible opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| to engineer, value engineer the building, but to make sure the building functions the way it needs to function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| but to build it as efficiently so that it not only costs less on the front end but operates efficiently as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| I appreciate that, and I appreciate that you have a background that will help you be a real effective person in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| And, Jim, I don't suspect that you'll put gold handles on the toilets, but I just want to make sure we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| That's reserved for the COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| That's only, yes, the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| We'll have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Council, I would like to have a five-minute recess before we get into the next item for just a quick break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| I don't have a lot of style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4558)|
| 1:16:13| It's pretty cool, the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| Council, we are now on Item 11L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| Item 11L is a resolution approving an amendment to the Knoxville South Waterfront Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| and Urban Renewal Plan to provide for tax increment financing prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Mayor, I'd like to call on Blanchard and Calhoun to, I believe they've got a presentation here for the Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| so if they would come up if they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Blanchard and Calhoun, the rest will come forward, and please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| My name is Mark Senn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| I'm with Blanchard County Commercial Corporation, 2743 Perimeter Parkway, Augusta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| Mayor, Council Members, I appreciate you taking the opportunity tonight to listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| We have a very exciting project that is a mixed-use project that we hope will anchor many good things in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4631)|
| 1:17:20| The project consists of renovating two office buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| completely taking apart basically a 184,000-foot office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4645)|
| 1:17:34| converting that to a hotel and restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and building some multifamily units, 300 units, constructing some student housing, and also constructing retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4658)|
| 1:17:51| So it truly is a mixed-use project in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| I think the total private investment we're estimating right now is about $144 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| The total project cost is about $166 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| A big component of all this is the public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| and that's what the majority of this TIF is being requested for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| The public improvements involve incorporating and bringing a riverwalk through the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| from one end of the property to the other end, tying in both bridges and tying into your existing riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4699)|
| 1:18:28| It also includes building a plaza for the public to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| It's an overlook, if you will, raised about 15 feet up off the river where you can have public events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| and hopefully it will be kind of a stopping point for people to get out with their bikes and walk and get on the riverwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| and also enjoy concerts and other things that can happen on the plaza facing the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| It gives a great view of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Another part of that component will be redoing Blount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| which would include possibly a roundabout, which has been proposed for that in your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| We have a traffic engineering study going on now to work that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| and also what public improvements are needed along the streetway as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| That would be, you know, does it require median?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Does it require only street parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| How to landscape it, how to make it really look pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| So those are the public improvements that we have involved with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| that I think will really help make this an anchor for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4769)|
| 1:19:34| I have Rhodes Seeger with me who will briefly go through the slide that we'll show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4774)|
| 1:19:41| We'll make it quick, and then if you have any questions, we'll be more than happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4781)|
| 1:19:49| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| My name is Rhodes Seeger, Blanchard & Cowan Commercial, address 2743 Perimeter Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| I'm trying to get the slide up, but we can kind of go through what you guys have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I know Mark did a good job of kind of going over the overview of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| It is a large project, so we wanted to break it down into different segments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| and give you an idea of the time frame for each segment of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| The first step in this development will be the demo of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| Everything highlighted in yellow is what we'll have to demolish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| That will include the main hospital buildings, which start from the office tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| which we'll keep all the way over to the Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| It totals around 588,000 square feet of area that we'll have to demo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| It also includes the old Valls Inn and a bank building there at the corner of Blount and Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Will the public be able to see any of this or just the handouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| And we can make this available to the public so that they can go through it if we're not able to get this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| You'll put it online or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Yeah, let's keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| We'll make sure it's on the website or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| So January 1st, we'll start demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| We're estimating that time frame to be around nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| So we'll complete the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| We'll have demolition complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| During that time frame, if you look on page four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| we'll also start the renovation of two office buildings off of Blount Avenue next to the Valls Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4879)|
| 1:21:27| That's the Baptist Professional Building and the Eye Institute Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| which is where Tenova's offices are currently located and also the Eye Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| On those two buildings, they total around 81,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| We'll do a complete exterior renovation and interior renovation of both buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| We'll start that work in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| There's currently tenants in both buildings, so we'll have to do most of the work at night and on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| So we're estimating to have that completed at the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| Our goal with both buildings is to bring it up to a Class A office building for both of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| On page five, this is the Baptist Medical Tower located right off Gay Street at Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| This building was built in the early 90s, so it's still a nice building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| It's around 180,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| We'll do a complete exterior renovation of this as well and interior renovation of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| If you look on page six, this gives you an idea of what we'll build back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| We'll start this in March, the renovation of these buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| and it'll have a 100-room hotel and 52 Class A apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| a 6,500-square-foot restaurant on the bottom floor, and a fitness facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| We're estimating this will start in March of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| We'll have it complete in March of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| If you look on page seven, this gives you the view looking from downtown to the backside of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| You can see on the bottom floor there we'll have a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| which will connect to the Vent Terrace and the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4981)|
| 1:23:06| And again, that'll open March 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| If you look on page eight, this is where we'll build student housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| It'll be 250 student housing units located off the Henley Street Bridge at Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=4997)|
| 1:23:22| It's currently a vacant parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| The plan for this is to start construction in May of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| If you look on page nine, this gives you a rendering of what we'll build back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| Estimating construction will be around a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| We'll open this back in July of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| This view that you're looking at, that's from Blount Avenue, looking back at the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5022)|
| 1:23:53| If you look at page ten, this is the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| Unfortunately, we cannot start construction on the apartments until the hospital building has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| Again, that's estimated to be complete in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| So we'll start construction on the apartments, our Riverwalk and the Vent Terrace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| and 18,000 square feet of retail in October of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| Estimating construction to last around a year on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| We'll open the apartments, Riverwalk, Vent Terrace in October of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| Also, when you're looking at this, you can get an idea of the Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| It'll stretch from Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| It'll go under the Henley Street Bridge and connect to the City View Riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| It'll also have access to Blount Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| The Vent Terrace is around 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| You can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| It's located next to the office building closest to Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| I want to show you on page 11, we've had some questions regarding parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| Each phase of this development will have its own parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| The apartments will have a parking deck in the center, which you can see in the gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| In the center of that will be a parking deck for the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| The student housing will have its own parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| We currently have a 650-space parking deck that's currently existing on the south side of Blount Avenue, which we'll keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| We view that as an area where the public can park for the Riverwalk and the Vent Terrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| Look at page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| This will give you an idea of what we'll build as far as the Vent Terrace goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| Again, this will be around 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| Our plan is to build this and deed it back over to the city for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| That's a general overview of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| At this time, we'd open it up for questions from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Any questions you'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Let me, before we do that, let me call on Mr. Wetzel to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| and explain some of the details before we go to the question part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| First of all, let me apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| We thought we did have a PowerPoint ready to go tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| Something happened to the equipment, so I'm not sure what did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| We'll have this presentation posted on our Web site tomorrow for the general public to see at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| Passing out the packet, I guess there's two things that I passed out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| One is a change to the actual ordinance that you'll be passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| This is the document right here that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| Amendment to the South Waterfront Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| On page three of that document, we had the word exclusive put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5182)|
| 1:26:27| It should have been the word inclusive in that document in two different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| And so we're going to take care of that to make sure that you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| That's on page three, second paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| It basically said when the redevelopment issue was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| it anticipated there might be $139 million worth of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| We limited that to $60 million when it was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| and it would be inclusive in this project and not exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| So at the end of the day, when this action is taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| the TIF district and the South Waterfront will still have $38 million of debt capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| and there will be $22 million come out of that and put onto this particular project is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| And that's what that change was to make sure that was clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| We have a $160 million project, $165 million project, of which in Mark's total private investments roughly $144,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5227)|
| 1:27:16| Of that, there's going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $30,000 to $36,000 of equity investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| from the gentleman that you've heard tonight from Blanchard and Calhoun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| There's going to be roughly $108,000 worth of personal debt on the project there, and then a $22 million TIF note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| You're talking about millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| I'm saying thousands of millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Sorry, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| I've been through these so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| You're talking millions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| I'm just leaving the zeros off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| $166 million total project, $22 million TIF, $30 million private equity investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| and $110 million roughly in debt at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| And then as you continue to go through the sheet, it's really the second sheet that we gave you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| It had the numbers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| You see the cash income flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| The total income before debt service will be right at over $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5282)|
| 1:28:10| What's that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| I thought I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| And then the cash flow after debt service will be roughly $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| So it's a six percent return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| And, as you know, that's not a lot of return, but that's already got the TIF figured into it at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| So if you go on to the next page, you'll see that the projects are eligible for TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5310)|
| 1:28:39| It totals up to $28 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| The request is for $22 million at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| A big part of that is the riverwalk improvements, $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| That includes the riverwalk between the two bridges, Blount Avenue improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| moves on to the river terrace and some work on the front of the building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| So there's a lot of public improvements there in that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| We can go into a lot of detail if you want, but I think the pictures you've seen say that better than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| If you go to the last page of the handout, this does get into the financing package to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| It's the worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| I think the easiest way to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Bob, do you have extra copies of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| We don't have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5358)|
| 1:29:19| I think council does have a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| I'm sorry if you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I don't, and I don't think Ms. Mitchell does either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| It's just the answer sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| You don't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| I'll get a copy later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5374)|
| 1:29:35| I thought I dropped one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Anyway, if you look at the bottom, there's a number of ways to read this spreadsheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| and they can all get complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| It doesn't matter how far you get deep in the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| But in the end, here's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| As a city, we currently, well, let's drop to the bottom line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| where it says TIF summary on that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| We currently receive $308,000 worth of taxes currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| During the TIF period, we'll receive $588,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| And then the property tax after the TIF will be $1.4 million to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| That's kind of the bottom line numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| And if anybody has questions as you go across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| the total available for debt service is $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And that's what it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| And if you take it now over up to 30 years, that will amortize the $22 million loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| So that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| And we can get into a lot of the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| or not a lot of the details as you want to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| But basically, it's going to take up to 30 years to amortize the $22 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| based on the incremental income that's coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| We should emphasize this is debt that will be borne by the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| The city is not recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| The recourse is the developers at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Well, I think it's important, Bob, to go a little bit deeper here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| with the incremental tax dollars that will be received from this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| as to exactly what that goes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| And to be real specific about what those dollars go for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| it will be for the remediation of blight, which is a big part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| The building on the brownfield level will go for the demolition of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| and help put back and to prepare that site for new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| It is a brownfield site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And then there will be another roughly $12 million that will go to the public improvements part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| the river walk from the Gay Street Bridge to the Henley Street Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| to the railroad bridge and then down to our new greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| Down below, it will also be the public plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| and it will also be improvements along Blount Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| the roundabout on Blount that's shown in the vision plan and the sidewalks out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| And what would be the possible exposure to the taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| At this point in time, there's no exposure to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| The investment, again, from Blanchard and Calhoun is $30 to $36 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| $30 to $36 million in cash or equity investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| And then they'll be able to know for both the big construction loan and for the TIF note as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5518)|
| 1:32:06| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Councilman Alvope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Well, I know you spent some time explaining this to me today, but I didn't have these other sheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| One of the things you just mentioned was the $36 million of equity being put in by the investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| and the development company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| I thought the old numbers we had were $28 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| It's $28 to $36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| You know, when they get to their banks, that's when those numbers are going to finalize at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| So it's a range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| It's a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| Well, they still have a lot of work to do, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| So let's put this in context, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| This is one of the first, not one of the first, but it's probably a medium step in the financing package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| They go through tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| If this TIF is approved tonight, if it's approved by county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| then they will go to finalize their actual loan closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| At that point in time, everything will farm up as what their actual cash contributions are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| Our part is known at $22 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Well, the reason I want to go back a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| and I think Councilman Pavlis may even have alluded to this, is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| I think people's first reaction is, oh, my God, we're giving away $22 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| and it's going to take 30 years before we see a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| And that's the first impression I think you get from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| and certainly what you get from the newspapers and the media, that we're putting in a big chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| and we're going to freeze the tax rate, and then the increment from this building value is going to go solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5614)|
| 1:33:41| to amortize the loan that the developer is taking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| And you went pretty far today to help me understand at least that that's not really correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| One thing is, for example, and you went over this last sheet very quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| but right now the building has an appraised value of $31 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| and when you apply the 40 percent tax rate to get to the assessment that we use for commercial buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| as opposed to the 25 percent we use for residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| you're talking about that first number in the summary, the $308,000 is kind of the tax level they're paying the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5652)|
| 1:34:22| and they're paying some to the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| But then, because you're building $150 million project, $144 million project, you're spending $165 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5665)|
| 1:34:35| but some of that's tear down and haul away kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| So you're building a $145 million project in terms of its end value, 148 end value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| The increment that's there is used two ways, and I don't think I got that from anything in the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| but I did in talking to you and going over these numbers and talking to Jordana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| And what's happening is as the building gets finished and is now evaluated as a completed project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5696)|
| 1:35:05| there's obviously more to tax, and it, in fact, is taxed at this $148 million or thereabouts level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| And two things happen with that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| Part of the increment goes to pay our debt service as a city because I think you said by state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| we can't give away the debt service portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| And that is reflected in the difference between that $308 million that you show in the summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| and the $588 million, or excuse me, thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| We're down to thousands here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| We're down to thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| We're getting to the short money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| And that's about $280,000 difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| And that number goes to help the city pay down its debt service that it carries because it carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| It's a proportion of our budget that we commit to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| Right, that we can't give away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| We cannot invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| No one has tied our hands, so we don't give away that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| We can't invest in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| We can't invest in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| It's not giving away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| It's an investment in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Well, it depends on your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Some people might see it that way, but we can't invest in the project in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| It has to stay at home and pay the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| So by fostering the project to go forward, one, we do something good for the south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| that we're all interested in seeing succeed is that is having this project done on a site that's kind of limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| in space and has a lot of demolition and issues that have to be addressed on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| And, two, we will increase the payout to the city once the buildings are completed, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| and the value is there on site by getting that tax payment percentage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5796)|
| 1:36:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Now, the only piece left so I think that's all to the plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| The only thing left is my concern that when we have such a long period like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| we're not talking five years, 10 years, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| We're talking 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| And you explained that's the time it takes in an amortization schedule to get enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| to pay down that piece of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| And so it might happen sooner, but that's the projected time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| But the concern is that 588,000, not million, but thousand, might look good in year one today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| or year five when they finish the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| But 30 years out, that will be reduced to a third of that just by, you know, depreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| It depends on the value of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| That number will always rise with the value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| What will rise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| That number can rise with the value of the property because it's based on the assessed value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| And it can either go up or down depending on what the market does to real estate in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| But I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| But those are the concerns that I think the citizens are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| Why are we putting so much in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| And part is there's a lot of public improvements and there's a lot of demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| and there's a lot of costs on the front end to get started there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| I think that's all very accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5876)|
| 1:37:57| All those things are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| I would say the great risk here is to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| It's not to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| The risk is to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| And I don't think anyone wants to see that sort of dead building sitting on the hillside staring at our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| and maybe even warning off people who might want to visit or enjoy our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| And to put people there is going to bring health to the businesses downtown as well as on the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| People will use our hotels and restaurants and shops and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| So, I mean, everyone wants to see this development go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| But as you ran through those numbers, I guess the news, good news for the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| is that we will be getting more than we're getting now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| and hopefully the project will bring economic stimulus that will provide other things like sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| and all the other things that go into making up a revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| And the only thing I'd add to that is the reduction of risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| The longer the buildings sit there like they are, we have potential growing liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| Just think of Jackson Avenue, for an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| So I think we have that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| On those numbers that were kind of ranges and stuff, when will that be more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| They will have to firm up by the time they close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| What you all are approving now will be the $22 million in the 30-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| That's the level of our commitment, and they use that to go to their lender and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Look, I've got a cash stream that will help pay that debt down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Is that a separate note, a separate $22 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Ours is, there's a $22 million TIF note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| There's a, I guess, construction and takeout note, Mark, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| And then there will also be the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| But we're not a part of the construction note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5971)|
| 1:39:32| We are the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| And so that excess revenue that's left over goes to pay down that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| They pay the tax, but it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| Yeah, that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| All this is collected tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| We collect all these tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| We keep our portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| We send off the rest to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| But if they don't raise enough to pay down on that note, Mark and his team are on the line for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| And the other reason I ask those things is it's complicated, I think, for most people to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| and figure out what are we doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| And we're stimulating growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| We're finding a means to make it go forward because the site is challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| And hopefully we get a good project with positive results for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| You're killing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| I think one of the ways to make it simple is that, like, several people have called me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| are we the city giving them $22 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| I think we need to just make sure that the citizens understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| But sitting there now, just the way it is, is worth only what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| But as we prove it, it's going to be worth more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| It's only large because the investment is so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| And we need that large of investment to handle that much property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| And we're very fortunate something like this has come forward, this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| The other question I have, then, is what kind of public input will we have on the plot areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| if those are going to be public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| I think Mark and his team, and Mark may want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| They've been very forthcoming with whatever thoughts we have on what that ought to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| and how that ought to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| They'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| I mean, have we had public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Because we're still at this concept stage on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| But we will have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| There can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| There will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| I'd just like to say two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| One is, I mean, there are opportunities that, you know, that money could be paid back quicker than 30 years, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6093)|
| 1:41:38| One is we're very conservative in our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| We say the cost will be $144 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| Well, if the value is $144 million, then I've made a mistake in investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| So we're obviously hopeful that it's going to be valued worth more than what our cost is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| So that's a conservative number in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Therefore, as the value would increase, so would the payment or the benefits derived as it relates to the taxes to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6118)|
| 1:42:07| The second part of that is that it's based on a 1.1 debt coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| 1.2, excuse me, debt coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| That means that there's more taxes being generated off this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| than actually needed for the debt service over 30 years by 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| So if all that money is being applied, it means that the term of the repayment will be shorter than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6146)|
| 1:42:34| 30 is the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| So it's set up, you know, the bank requires you to have overcoverage basically on the debt from your estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| So both those items allow us an opportunity to pay back quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| The 22 million, you know, you look at the 22 million, you look at how it's broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| If you're going to build a river walk in this area, you'd have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| And that's what part of this money is going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| If you're going to do improvements to Blount Avenue, you'd have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| You'd have to do those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| If you're going to do an event terrace, you'd have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| This gives you an opportunity to have all those improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| and pay for them by the taxes generated by the private investment on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| And I hope people see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| It's not a gift to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| It's an opportunity and a way to do a lot of the public improvements when you look at the dollars being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| And the way to pay for it is with the investment, private investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| that goes along with the public improvements that are being done with you guys hopefully approving the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| Councilman Grave, did you have more or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I will be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| I gave money from Hoxton Hills, so I'll just go through it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| And I think that everyone wants to know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6228)|
| 1:43:49| This is probably the biggest TIF we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| It is the biggest TIF we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| But I think Bob ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| The biggest project we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| I think Bob summarizes it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| You know, the risk is not doing anything and just letting that building sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| And I don't believe that this council, the time that I've served with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| has exhibited that type of a mindset, and I hope we wouldn't take to that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| I mean, obviously, you know, we talk about South Knoxville, and it's a huge catalyst for South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| but it's a huge catalyst for all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| I mean, we've got a vacant building there that, you know, call it what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| but it's an eyesore because it's sitting there vacant and nothing is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| And we've got a very vibrant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| And even though it sits in South Knoxville, it's still an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| And we keep talking about what's the plan for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Well, we keep growing out and growing out from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| And this is another outgrowth from downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| And it's a huge outgrowth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| But let's go back and remember, too, what's happened to the people, the merchants along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| They have suffered ever since this bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| And this project is going to be something really great for Knoxville for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| But in the short term, in the interim, I mean, this isn't going to happen a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| This is going to start now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| We've got the good news that the bridge is going to open sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| But guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| There's going to be construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| There's going to be all type of people bustling around this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| They're going to go eat at the Shawnee's, at the King Tut's, wherever, and Arby's and McDonald's and everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6314)|
| 1:45:22| So, you know, I think that the merchants deserve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| It's been a long time coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| And not only that, but when this is completed, there will be probably, I think, 2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| I forget how many jobs it will create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| However many, if it's 1,500 or 2,000 jobs, it's going to replace what was left vacated when Baptist left that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| So, you know, let's think about that positive that it will bring to, you know, the public part of it that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| I think, Mark, you described it great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Just to go and do it, you know, would be very, very hard for us as a city to take on that extra debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| So it's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| So, you know, with that, I'll let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| But I'm going to, of course, obviously make the motion that we approve this tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Any other comments, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| We're looking forward to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| Twelve days in ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| I just ‑‑ there's really not too much here on the information sheet, so I'd just like to ask Mr. York to come down and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| He'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Where is Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| There he is coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6415)|
| 1:47:00| This is obviously a very significant amendment to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| And one of the questions I had is we just had a ‑‑ we just issued quite a bit of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| and so what's the advantage and disadvantage of not including this in that bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6430)|
| 1:47:19| Well, again, what you're doing here is we have a variety of projects that we've pretty much designated the debt proceeds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6439)|
| 1:47:29| This is additional funding that will be used to pay for public improvements related to the development of ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6449)|
| 1:47:40| Rivers Edge Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Rivers Edge Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| At Island Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| In South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| What we will have is the developer will be doing various public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| We will then ‑‑ the city will then acquire those public improvements at a cost not to exceed $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6473)|
| 1:48:00| And, again, that's what we're doing today is this budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Again, that's what that relates to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| The cash will probably not come out for a couple of years, but we're doing this so we can get financing in place for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6488)|
| 1:48:16| And, once again, this is a $15 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| Mr. John Gunford is right behind me here, and he asked if you have questions on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| It's a $15 million development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| It's anticipated we'll kick off TIF revenues into this amount, roughly this 2.5 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| And so we're just setting the budget up where we can pay for those public improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| with that new TIF revenue that comes in when the development is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| This one is different because this comes ‑‑ you just amended the big ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| you voted to amend the big TIF district and create an individual project for Baptist Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| This is a project directly out of the South Waterfront TIF district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| So you budget 2.5 now so we can have an agreement with Mr. Gunford to do the public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| which we will pay for when they are completed to a couple of years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| But we can't go forward with the project until there's an improvement of having it in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| But the proceeds for this will come from the TIF district itself generated by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| You look a little confused, Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| I am confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| So is this ‑‑ but this is different than a TIF, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| It's within the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| Yeah, this is ‑‑ what you're going to deny is different than a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| This is not a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| This will be a direct cash outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| We are optimistic that the development will spin off additional taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| and you can look at it this way, but this will be a direct cash outlay to purchase the public improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| Based on the TIF revenues that will come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| based on the new increment that will come in from the John Gunford development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| My confusion comes in that you had detailed information on these other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| but what are we as a city buying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| At this point in time, you're buying nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| What you're going to buy, what you're going to buy at the 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| and really KCDC is one that will be buying, and those details are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| There's the widened roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| John, you might want to come up and help me explain this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| There's a lot of requirements in the form‑based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| and it basically buys all the required public improvements in the form‑based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| John, you've looked at this more than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| Why don't you give a couple of comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Yes, good evening, Madam Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| I'm John Gunford with Camden Partners out of Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| The TIF payment, I call it a TIF payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Effectively, we have approximately $180,000 annually of additional property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6640)|
| 1:50:48| that are generated from the Rivers Edge apartment project that we are proposing to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6648)|
| 1:50:55| And that is what's being used to fund the public portion of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6655)|
| 1:51:01| And that public portion includes widening the roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| putting in some new roadways to comply with the form‑based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| as well as a riverwalk to serve that project and the neighborhood around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6670)|
| 1:51:18| What I'm confused about is, like on the previous one, we had documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| In other words, it's almost as though, Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| you're saying approve $2.5 million and what it's going to be is a riverwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6692)|
| 1:51:33| I understand your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Let me say this, too, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| This will be on two readings, and I'll get you a lot more detail by the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| We had a lot of work to get the detail together on the one right before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| This one's been trailing right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| That's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| The one before is very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| And this is a different project because we're not actually amending the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| but we are amending the budget for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| And I would say that our engineering drawings have actually been through MTC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| so there is some detail on the part improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| Just share it with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6730)|

| 1:52:12| Mr. Gunford, as long as you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| I remember attending a public meeting sometime in the spring or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| when there was sort of an uproar about the project and did it fit the existing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| And I understand you've been back to the well in the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Can you just take a minute and tell us how you've resolved some of those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6747)|
| 1:52:32| Because it was controversial at the time when you were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Well, the controversy surrounded a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| One, the size of the development, the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| And we went from, at that time, we were proposing 180 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| and we've dropped down to 134 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| So we've reduced the scale of the development more in line with the existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| And then I think we got everyone comfortable with the product type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| There was a concern about it being a student housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| And we did a market study, posed the question about student housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| and I think we've done a good job in getting the neighborhood comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| that we're not building a student housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| It's more of a market rate apartment project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| We did our demand studies, and it came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| and showed a strong demand for the product that we're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| So that is the way, and I've been back in front of several neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| and shared those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6809)|
| 1:53:31| And I'm sure the council and I personally appreciate your taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| and the energy to meet with those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| and hopefully you've got a better project and certainly one that is better received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6822)|
| 1:53:43| I think if you do that, you end up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| I think if you go back to the community, listen to what they are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| eventually you'll end up with a better product, and I think we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| And also on the public improvements, a big part of it is the boardwalk along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| and we are hopeful that that will be a benefit not only to our units that we're putting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| but the existing units as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I thought you had a marina or something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| We do not have a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| We have a dock that goes out into the water, but it's not a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Bob mentions the appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| Is anything coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| Are we taking anything out of the fund balance for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| I think Jim would need to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| The source for this will be appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| And, again, fund balance is, again, what some people, and I don't refer to it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| but some people refer to it as the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| That's not the proper accounting terminology, but I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| that's what people around here call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| So we would be withdrawing from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| If all the numbers come in exactly as planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| then this would come from appropriated fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| It would come from that rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| How much will be paid back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| How much will we be withdrawing from the fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| I guess that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Up to $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| But, Councilman Brown, let me also remind you that with the new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| we're going to be generating new taxes to come into the city treasury as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| That's the key part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| I just had another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| Have we given a TIF on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| I don't know if there's anybody on this Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| but when the South Waterfront TIF District was created in 2005, you authorized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| go back to where we were earlier tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| $60 million worth of debt in the South Waterfront TIF District over a 40-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| So, that has already been authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6964)|
| 1:56:07| Mark Mametoff, I think, is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| Our modern Council can come down and go into more detail about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| So, go back to what we did tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| You actually reduced the amount of that $60 million to $38 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6974)|
| 1:56:18| because you put $22 million at Babson's and now we'll have $38 million for the rest of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| So, we haven't put any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| Not in this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| There has been money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| There's the money for the South Waterfront that were spent in the last administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| the early days of this one, actually going forward with Sudbury Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| are monies that have been allocated to the South Waterfront project, TIF project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| We have not generated enough proceeds to pay it back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7003)|
| 1:56:47| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| Because now we're, because we need, if we want this development to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| we're going to have to get these public improvements to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| A lot of the earlier investments will hopefully come to fruition when Sudbury Park is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| and we'll get the development around that and these other spinoffs start to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7023)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| And so the project is $17 million that will go on to the tax rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| Fifteen to $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| And I want to thank John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| He has done, Mr. Gumpert, he has done an excellent job of coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| He not only met with the Island Home folks, but he met with Osevere and the South Woodlawn as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| So, I mean, he's, you know, and this council has been very up front that we expect people to come in and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7048)|
| 1:57:36| And he's gone, I think, over and above to inform people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| He listened from the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I've seen the renderings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| I mean, is everybody going to be happy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| I don't think that project is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| But I haven't heard back from anybody formally that there's opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| So, you know, I made the motion to support it, and I hope we go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7074)|
| 1:58:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7089)|
| 1:58:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7091)|
| 1:58:12| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| We'll be back in two weeks for the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| 12D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations, Article 4, Section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7096)|
| 1:58:21| to amend Section 4.0 and adding Section 4.2 to establish development regulations and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| for the area described in the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7112)|

| 1:58:35| We have two people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| Well, I've got one person signed up then to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Mike Clark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| Checked the wrong box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7126)|
| 1:58:47| Helping somebody do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Mike Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| I have a business at 1824 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| I'm also the president of the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| and we've been working very closely with the members of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| and we'd just like to let you know that we fully, fully support this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| and think it's going to be a really, really good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| You know, I've lived here all my life, went to the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7147)|
| 1:59:11| and when we were kids, you know, we went downtown, downtown kind of went away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| and, you know, the malls were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| I really love to see what's gone on downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| and we think that Cumberland can really, really do some of the same things that the downtown has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7162)|
| 1:59:29| When you folks, when Citi put in money downtown, redid the streets, redid the lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| made it look nice, made it attractive, it boomed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| and we really do think that Cumberland can do the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| and we would like to see this go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| That is our desire as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265131015?start=7186)|
