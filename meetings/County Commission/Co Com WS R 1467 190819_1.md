| 2:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8967)|
| 2:29:28| I was just curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| Anyhow, that motion is probably before us and as you all saw on forum, we as a body also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| agree that this would be the time of year when, you know, moving forward, it's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| in our commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8977)|
| 2:29:38| I would like to point out that this is the day after Labor Day, so everybody watch your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8978)|
| 2:29:43| vacation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| We have an unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| I already have a non-refundable trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| That day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Thirty-eight anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| That week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8992)|
| 2:29:53| You're gone that week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| I'll take that from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| Anybody else gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| You got two gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| Two gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| Who else is going to be gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8998)|
| 2:29:59| Evelyn and Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| It's like a Baptist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| You get all the bad assignments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| You have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| Can we do the tenth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| We've got to take a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| If Mr. Law Director would take a look, I mean, I know that the Rules Committee, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9006)|
| 2:30:10| brought to us a resolution last year or a year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9010)|
| 2:30:15| Exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9015)|
| 2:30:16| Or was it last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Well, it's a unanimous resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| Director, take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9022)|
| 2:30:23| I mean, I know that the Rules Committee, I believe, brought to us a resolution last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9023)|
| 2:30:28| or a year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9028)|
| 2:30:29| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Or was it last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| It was passed unanimously by this body to schedule these reorgs for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| I know, John, you helped make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| Knowing now that we've got two commissioners that will not be able to make this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| reorg meeting based on the date scheduled from our rules, if we want to schedule this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9045)|
| 2:30:52| for a different time in order to accommodate our two commissioners, what is the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| Do you look for a majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9057)|
| 2:30:58| You'll have to have another resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| You can only wipe out a resolution by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| This was resolved by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| The only way to get around that is to revolve and reappoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9062)|
| 2:31:14| It's a resolution that amended our rules, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| Could we not suspend our rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9079)|
| 2:31:20| I think the proper vote would be to suspend the rules as it relates to scheduling this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9080)|
| 2:31:24| What does the rule exactly say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| I think the gist of it is we will have our meeting the following Tuesday after September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9087)|
| 2:31:36| The first day after September 1st, which, obviously, with the Labor Day holiday, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9096)|
| 2:31:41| going to be Tuesday then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| I don't even know if we specified the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9102)|
| 2:31:43| I may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| I don't know if we specified the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9105)|
| 2:31:46| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9106)|
| 2:31:47| I just think my husband did this as a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9107)|
| 2:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9108)|
| 2:31:49| He should have read our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9109)|
| 2:31:50| He's the one that pays the bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9110)|
| 2:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| Here's what I think should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9112)|
| 2:31:53| Basically, should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| So, it says you've got to be held on September 1st or the next business day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9114)|
| 2:32:24| See, this is a good lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9144)|
| 2:32:28| What happened a couple of years ago is we moved it up to, I think it was two years from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| this year, we moved it up to the work session day, and it ruffled some feathers, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9152)|
| 2:32:39| we changed the rules because somebody got their feathers ruffled, and now here we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| stuck again wanting to change our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9163)|
| 2:32:46| This is a good lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| Here's my recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| I think we have to send this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| I think that we can post on the forum a couple of alternative dates, and at the meeting next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9177)|
| 2:33:05| week we will have to vote to suspend the rules to schedule this meeting because we are subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9185)|
| 2:33:11| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| That, I think, is in the short run the way to remedy this, and what I'll ask is both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9192)|
| 2:33:23| our commissioners who are going to be, I guess, out of town that week, but I'll post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9203)|
| 2:33:28| a couple of options to the forum, and hopefully we can come into the meeting next week, next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9208)|
| 2:33:35| Monday, ready to make a decision on RE-ORG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Does that sound acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| And I'm looking to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| A vote to suspend the rules will take a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9222)|
| 2:33:43| Takes a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9223)|
| 2:33:44| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| So what happens if you do that, and then there are other people that aren't available at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| the other dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| We'll make sure everybody's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| I mean, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9235)|
| 2:33:56| What days are we changing it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| We're not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| The bottom line is we scheduled this meeting based on the rules that this body approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| last year, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9246)|
| 2:34:09| We've got two commissioners who can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| I think it's in the best interest of the commission and the community to have everybody represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| here at that RE-ORG meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| The way to amend it is we do have in our commission rules that by a two-thirds vote, you can suspend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9258)|
| 2:34:25| the rules for the purpose of one vote or a meeting, and we'll vote to suspend that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9265)|
| 2:34:32| rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| We can then have a discussion about when would be the best date for everyone, and we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| schedule the RE-ORG meeting in September to find a date that will work for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| At least that's my take, and I'm getting a nod from my friend, the law director, who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9285)|
| 2:34:49| says that will meet the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Commissioner Cairns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| Yeah, I just want, in all fairness to my husband and all that, he has Mondays for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| So Labor Day being Monday, he's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| So the proper motion on this, I believe, is to send it forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| because we'll have to deal with it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| Who made the original motion on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9315)|
| 2:35:16| He withdraws his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9316)|
| 2:35:17| You can change the motion to send forward no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| So you agree to that, and the second agrees to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| So the motion before us to send this forward with no recommendation, all in favor, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9328)|
| 2:35:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| No one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| We have which...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9334)|
| 2:35:35| How many nays do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| We have two nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| Two sayings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467190819?start=9338)|
