| 0:03:27| I'm Gina Vandergriff and I am a Cub Den Leader and an Assistant Scoutmaster with both Pack 255 and Troop 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=207)|
| 0:03:36| We're out of South Knoxville and our chartered organization is Colonial Heights United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| And we appreciate you having us here tonight with us. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=223)|
| 0:03:53| Hi there. I am Matthew Bryan. I'm also an Assistant Scoutmaster with Troop 255 with these boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| And I was recently a part of Pack 255 as well when my son was with the Pack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| But then he crossed over a couple of years ago and I'm no longer technically with the Pack, but I'm still with the Troop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| Well, thank you so much for joining us. This should meet the citizenship in the community as well as the Arrow of Light requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=252)|

| 0:04:51| Is there any other elected officials that I have through my old eyes have not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| We wondered if the mayor and I thought if none of us saw him, he surely isn't here, but he snuck in somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=298)|
| 0:05:05| There he is. Okay. Yeah. And Mayor Jacobs. Thank you, Mayor Jacobs. Is there any thing you'd like to address with the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=305)|

| 0:05:41| Now we're going to move into the public forum part of our agenda. For those of you who are here to speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| I also want to advise everyone, both my fellow commissioners as well as our guests in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| we have right now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| We have 11 guests who have signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| We are to manage this. I'm going to probably limit it to five minutes per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| I know that there are some who wish to speak about the attorney fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| That's also something that we have planned to add as an agenda item for discussion purposes later on in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| And your opportunity to speak may or may not come up at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| but I did want to make sure that you all were aware that if you've reviewed our agenda online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| that it is something that's on as a proposed discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| So the first one on our agenda is for public forum, if we've got the timer ready, is Herb Moncier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| Mr. Chairman, if we might defer the three individuals on the attorney fee matter to the consideration of 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| I think our comments might be more applicable to the discussion on number 55 when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| May we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| And that would be Mr. Holifield and Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| Or is it Terrett or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| It's Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| G-A-R-R-E-T-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| All right. Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| All right. We'll do that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Okay. Next on public forum is Dr. John Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=440)|
| 0:07:30| Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Oh, here he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Oh, he's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| I am his wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| I'm Wendy Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| And if you could state your-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Wendy, could you also state your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Yes. It's 2537 Kings Mountain Lane, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| He was unable to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| He's a physician, and he sees patients until 6, so he is with patients right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| So I have to kind of fill in for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| But we're here to speak on behalf of Knoxville BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| He's the president of Knoxville BMX, and I'm a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| We have some others here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| So we just really wanted to kind of talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| because I haven't had the opportunity to speak to all of you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| just about our vision in Knoxville BMX and what we hope to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| because there's a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| And first, we really just want to reach the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| We want to get kids on bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| We want them to be able to have opportunities other than your traditional stick and ball sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| We want them to be able to get out there with their families, you know, just have another outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| We have several ways that we want to serve the community in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| There are several things within the education, Department of Education itself, as far as schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Like there's a STEM program that we want to help to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| There's a Ride to Read program that we also want to implement in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| There's a program for track modeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| There's just several opportunities for us to be able to be involved in ways just outside of cycling itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And so that's one of the components of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Another way we want to be involved is we want to help all children have this opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| So if there's underprivileged kids, we would have a program that's a loaner bike program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| We've already got donors that have given us their word that they want to help in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| where we're going to have a fleet of bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| So if a child comes to our track and they don't have a bike that is a race bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| but they really want to get out there, we're going to have a whole array of those bikes, helmets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| all the things that they need so that they can participate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| We've talked to some other members of the community, some organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| about having a scholarship program as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| So if there are children out there that also need help financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| that we could be able to supplement and help those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| So there's just a lot of ways that we want to reach the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| We were born and raised in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| That's where I'm from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I went to school at Southville Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| That area is just very important to me and our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| So that's something that's important to us in that community in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| We want to give back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| That's where we've been our whole lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| So that's one part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| But the other part of the BMX itself is there's an economic impact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| And South Knoxville could also use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| I mean, there's all the cycling that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| And this is just going to add to that because the mountain biking, it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| My family participates in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| But this helps to reach some of the younger kids that aren't able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| and gives them a different opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| And with USA BMX, and they're not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| they were unable to be here because they have their Grand National next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| which is a huge event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| It's one of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| But they've already said that within the first one to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| we will have a national event at this track if we build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Economic impact, currently in Music City, they get $1.4 million every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| Music City has had a national for at least the last 20 years every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| It's one of those things that once they start it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| they're committing to us to be able to put this event here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| minimum five years in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| So that economic impact, if you add that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| that's well over $8 million in the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| So we know that this can get money back as well because it's an investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| but there's money there to be made back from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| So there's several ways it can impact the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| And we just wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I know that not everybody's gotten to hear everything about BMX and the sport of BMX,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| so I won't rehash all of that because I don't have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| But we just wanted to be here to say that it's just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| we've been working on this for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| My husband started six years ago with Madeline Rojero and then also with Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| And so we've put a lot of time and effort into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| And if for any reason we need to hold off and continue to look at numbers and budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| we're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| We will do whatever it takes to be able to help get this project to continue forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| and to, you know, to get this in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| So really that's, you know, we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Any questions that anyone has, we will answer those as well as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| But that's just basically, we just wanted to share our heart with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| And I know I'm not my husband, and he really wanted to be here, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| But, you know, so that's basically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| Just wanted to share that with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| So hopefully that helps and we can fill in any other gaps that you have for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| I've noticed that Commissioner Daly's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| And I see the Appalachian Mountain Bout Clubs here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| and I think they're scheduled to speak if they want to on the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| I've been in contact just for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| I've been in contact today with John David, the president of the BMX USA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| We've been on a couple of phone calls and passing back some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| And Mr. David has reassured me that I forward him the numbers that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| He has reassured me that these numbers can't come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| And during the presentation at the PBA, I've got some questions on where these numbers come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| and how many RFQs were sent out and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| And I've got great concerns that we're looking at maybe I'm going to say the word inflated number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| I was talking with the president, David, today, and a similar track that was in Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=784)|
| 0:13:13| it's not Roswell, it's Powder Springs, I think, Powder Springs, Georgia, was only $850,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| How we come from a track at, you know, the last track that was built at $850,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| to now we're at $1.9 million, there's a lot of questions that need to be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| And hopefully some of these questions will be asked tonight and next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And I'm in no rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| And I hope this commission is not in any rush to pass judgment on these large numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| until we get a good set of numbers, good reasoning behind why these numbers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=823)|
| 0:13:53| And if it takes 60 days or 90 more days to do this, that's what I want to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| This is a very important project for not only South Knoxville, but for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| It is a moneymaker, it can be a moneymaker for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| And I was shocked almost to the point when I seen the first number at $1.9 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| and now I see we've got some information today and now we're up to like $2.4 million on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| And these numbers, we've got to come up with some rationale behind these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And hopefully we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| And I'm hoping that, you know, John David, the president of BMX USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| and Dr. Edwards, who is the president of BMX USA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| and I think he's got some office holders here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| If you would just raise your hand, the treasurer, secretaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| What I might want to do, I know we've got a lot of folks here for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| and that is something we've got proposed for the agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| I don't want to kind of start our item later in the agenda right now if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| So we do have two other folks who do want to speak to this item that signed up for public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| and that's Brian Han.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Is Brian here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| Brian, if you could state your name and address for the record, and you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| My name is Brian Han, 654 Helix Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| That's 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| I appreciate Carson inviting us to this workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| I'm the past president of the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| and I was president during the time of much of the urban wilderness trail construction in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=930)|
| 0:15:42| We were asked at the last meeting, the workshop at South Double Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| whether or not BMX ties into mountain biking and cycling in general, and it absolutely does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=947)|
| 0:15:56| We have an issue with getting younger people into our sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| just because it's quite difficult to put a child in the woods away from their parents, unseen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| on quite difficult terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| And a lot of folks, if you ask them, they started their cycling career with a BMX endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=969)|
| 0:16:21| I can't speak to the numbers that are being thrown out there in terms of the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| I can speak to when this kind of all came up four or five years ago, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| we were kind of at the table asking our opinion, and as a mountain bike organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| we absolutely support increased healthy activity, and cycling just happens to be our domain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=998)|
| 0:16:47| When the numbers did come, originally, I do remember a number that was going to take, build new fields and a track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1007)|
| 0:16:58| and it seemed, I'm a construction guy, I renovate buildings downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| The numbers seemed low, and it's not surprising to me that this project is a bit over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| Quite a bit now, you say 1.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| But at the same time, there's a will and I think there's a way for the community to get this project done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| Now, whether that's adding more money from the county budget, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| That's why you all sit up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| But I will say that in South Knoxville, we have scrabbled together an amazing network of trails for very little of the county's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1049)|
| 0:17:41| and I think with a little creative attitude towards this project, it can get done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1061)|
| 0:17:50| I'm not sure what that is, how that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Like I said, Wes and I, Wes is the current president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| We're kind of on the sidelines of this, quietly supporting this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| But I think when Knox County comes together and a bunch of people come together that want something done, we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| So I just would ask that you all don't just discount the work that's already been done on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| and see if there's some folks that can make this thing happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Next person on public forum is Matt Hull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1102)|
| 0:18:34| And Matt, if you could formally state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| Good evening. My name is Matt Hull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| My address is 7701 Martin Mill Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| I was asked to come tonight and speak about youth sports in south Knoxville and how it relates to this BMX project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| I currently am the touchdown club president at South Oil High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| I am the commissioner of the South Oil Youth Football Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| I am a board member and one of the founding members of South Oil Youth Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| also assistant scoutmaster at Troop 36, former cubmaster at Pike 236.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1146)|
| 0:19:13| So I serve two terms middle school PTA, two terms Bonnie Kate PTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| So I'm very active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| The way I got involved in this whole project is because of my relationship working with the parks department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| with the youth football program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| I was approached by the parks department to figure out how to gain community support for the BMX project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1167)|
| 0:19:35| and to have it work and coincide with the youth sports we already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| So when I talked, initially met, I said, well, you know, this stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| which I think some people feel like is not being used, is actually being used quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| At the time this discussion began, we had a middle school girls' soccer team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| a middle school boys' soccer team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| We had youth football teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| We had a semi-pro football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| We had Bearden youth football programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| We had the PTA was using it as fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| We had PBIS, which is incentive programs for the middle school, field days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| All of this was going on in the stadium before this project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| So this is hundreds and hundreds of kids that are using the stadium, and it's benefiting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| So basically I said the information I've gathered from the community is that they don't want to lose these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| They said, well, you'll never use all the seating here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Our other two options are Safety City and Melton Hill, which is on the other side of the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| We want to keep it close to the cycling community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I said, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| You make a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Take the field on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Give us a place where we can do youth athletics and make sure that we don't lose our track and field stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1239)|
| 0:20:47| because that's one of the sanctioned sports that the school is involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| So this all came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| We had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I said, look, you need to have audiovisual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| You need to be able to tell everybody what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| There was a huge meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I think it's been two years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Several people in this room were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| There was a PowerPoint presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| There was a map of a typical Tuesday night at Southville Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| There was soccer practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| There was football practice on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| There was BMX practice down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Everything was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| So basically what has happened now because we've come to the discussion of this being over budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| we now have no track and field facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| There's no determination of what the students, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| there's 50 to 100 kids that are not denied to participate in a school-sanctioned sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| where they're going to be able to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| The track is no longer functional because of damage and moving the dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| There's no fields, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| The ground has been leveled and it's been top-seated to prevent erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| but I do not know the current condition of the top fields now that are on grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| and whether they can be used by the student body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| So basically what we've done in essence, trying to create more activities for the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| we've taken them all the way as far as the outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| You know, those facilities were used to raise money for us to do these sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| because several of them are non-sanctioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Some of them are sanctioned and done by the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| So really I'm just here to speak to say we need to make some determination to allow these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| to have what they initially had before this all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And I hope that we can add more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I think South Knoxville is growing, but I want to make sure we don't lose anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| The next person I have registered for public forum is Christy Lynch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| Christy, if you could please come down and formally state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| Christy Lynch, 326 South David Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| Good evening, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| I want to first thank you for your time in serving our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| I am a resident of Farragut Hills Estates, and tonight I am serving as a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| I am here simply just to make you aware of item number 59| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| that's going to be on your agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| You have been given a packet of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| There are 48 properties that are very concerned about this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| and some of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Some of the neighbors have been able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| So if you all will please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Forty-eight properties are in agreement on what they want to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| We know times have changed, and so development is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| So we respect the property owner's right to develop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| and we do not oppose the property being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| But what is currently being proposed is three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| We live in a 64-year-old established subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| It's mostly agricultural, single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| We have lot sizes varying as small as one acre and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| Ask any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| We love the character of our subdivision, especially the large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| We're not the kind of people to look over our neighbor's fence and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| We just love living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| We even have one of the original lots that was ten acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| and it was developed in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| It's going to be wooded lane on your map in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Nobody objected to this being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| It has been a welcome addition to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Everything was developed in line with our deed restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Today we are humbly asking that you each please take the time this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| to look into this matter further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| We would like the opportunity to meet you, to talk with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| But if you could please at least come and drive through our established subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| to get a better understanding of its character and our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| Our subdivision is simply asking that we would be allowed to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| the existing character by the commission denying the three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| and limiting the density to one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| For your convenience, my name and contact information is on the front page at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Next speaker on public forum is Bert Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Bert, if you could please come and formally state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I'm Bert Benedict, 1710 Howard, in Fountain City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| A few weeks ago I talked to you all about restoring face-to-face visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| at the Knox County Intake Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I was thinking that some of you may think that this might be impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| since I presume that we're under a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| and I know that they just recently paid the county some money for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| You should know, however, that many other states and communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| have restored face-to-face visits for the inmates at the intake populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| and have rejected Securus as a provider for phone visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1611)|
| 0:26:59| in many cases due to the fact that it's so costly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| especially in rural areas like outside of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| You know, we have a lot of inmates at the intake center that come from the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| These people are poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| They don't have the money to call on the Skype and all that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| Anyway, you should know that places like Texas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Arkansas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1642)|
| 0:27:32| California, and Massachusetts have all reinstated face-to-face visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| in the last few years and have ended their contracts with Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Cities like Natchez, Mississippi completely did away with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| Washington, D.C. has gone back to face-to-face visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| And so many people in the legal profession realize now that face-to-face visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1676)|
| 0:28:10| actually help the families and the inmates achieve, what's the word I'm saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| but they don't have as many people suffering from depression in the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| Sometimes they sit there for many, many months at a time with no visitors, no phone calls, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| So face-to-face has helped with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| Also, the people in the justice centers and in the intake centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| use visitation rights as a thing to promote good behavior amongst the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| You know, if they're there and they know nobody's ever going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| you can kind of see where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| And it's all part of the plan to reduce inmate population in many of these states by at least 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| That is a national goal that we are seeing as a routine now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| is that states and communities want to eliminate 20% of the people that are in their jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1751)|
| 0:29:18| And a lot of that is being done by bail reform and other forms rather than just incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1758)|
| 0:29:27| So in Texas, of all places, you know, law and order Texas, everybody thinks Texas is tough on crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| Well, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| But they have reduced their inmate population in the last five years by 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| and it's saved the taxpayers of the state of Texas several hundred million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| The programs, you can find it on the Internet as to what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| So in closing, I would like to read this to you from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| this is from a recent article from the Christian Monitor magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1799)|
| 0:30:11| In Texas, their form of government is the county judge is the chief executive of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| and its top elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| The county judge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Not the sheriff, not the attorney general, but the county judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| In Texas, Dallas County, which has gone back to face-to-face visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Judge Clay Jenkins says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| psychology and common sense tells you that it's better for the prisoners and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| to sit across from each other and see each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| rather than talking through a cell phone or a Skype device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Seventy-three percent of the people in our jails have not been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| That means they are innocent until proven guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Here again, Judge Clay Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| He opposed ending in-person visitations in a told NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| and 100% of these people's families, their spouses and their children, are innocent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| And they are the people that pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Okay. Next on public forum we have, I believe it's Miriam Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| If you could please formally state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1890)|
| 0:31:38| Yes. Hello, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Miriam Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I live at 2833 White Oak Lane in Knoxville, of course, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1902)|
| 0:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I would like to reiterate many of the things this gentleman just spoke of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| For the visitation rights in Knox County jails, it really still surprises me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| and I get more and more alarmed about just thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| And I have looked up many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| I'd like to just read some of them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Again, for many inmates in county jails awaiting trial, the days are long, lonely, and stressful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| For them, visiting with family is their only connection to the outside world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| It is a connection that deserves as much protection as the right to private counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| It is an act that needs to be safeguarded by those operating the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Many county jail inmates have not been convicted of a crime, as this gentleman just told us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| and do not have the resources to make bail before trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| While some who enter these local jails only stay a few days or weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| many remain behind bars for months at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| While inmates wait to appear before a judge, these individuals deserve to communicate with loved ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| Their families should not have to carry the burden of high fees intended as revenue for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| That financial burden, we remind leaders, unfairly affects the largest population of the incarcerated, the poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2001)|
| 0:33:32| Counseling clients on the video system alone is more problematic than helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| In the safety of inmates, it is not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Other advocates also are concerned about the possibility that attorney-client conversations are being illegally recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2024)|
| 0:33:55| This was an article in 2014, so this issue has been around for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2035)|
| 0:34:05| And as this gentleman said, it's been dealt with in many cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| In April, securists and top law enforcement agencies in this county in Texas, Travis County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| were sued over recorded conversations between defense lawyers and inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2059)|
| 0:34:27| Communications protected under the Constitution, advocates say the recordings were turned over to prosecutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2067)|
| 0:34:38| Of course, I'm not saying that that has happened here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| It certainly may have, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| But that was actually done against securists several years ago, four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| In-person visitation has a public benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| In 2011, again some time ago, Minnesota Department of Corrections study shows that visits from family and clergy reduce recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2096)|
| 0:35:10| These visits can significantly improve the transition offenders make from institution to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2110)|
| 0:35:19| A single visit, a single visit can lower the risk of a person to re-offend by 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2119)|
| 0:35:30| When visitations are reduced or eliminated, recidivism increases, according to the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| Benefits to public and inmate safety, supports for fragile families, and adherence to the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| are all important parts of the corrections equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| And I ask all of you to please consider the importance of face-to-face visitation for people incarcerated awaiting trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2152)|
| 0:36:05| It is extremely important for them and for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| The next citizen who has asked to speak at public forum is, now you were Sandra, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2173)|
| 0:36:23| She was Sandra, right, I've got so many I'm trying to keep track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| That was Miriam, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| So Sandra Cannon is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Sandra, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Does anyone know Sandra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Is Sandra Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Okay, I'll keep her name handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| We do have another segment for public forum at the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Next citizen on our list for public forum is Chris Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| Chris, if you could formally state your name and address for the record, please, when you reach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| I'll try not to do it informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| My name is Chris Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| My address is 2131 Riverside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| My father was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| My grandfather was born in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| According to my Uncle Buford, we've been here for about six generations, so I'm a local kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| I want to talk about some of the in-person visitation or lack of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| Last time I was here, I mentioned that there's about at least 100 years of studies that show the benefits of in-person visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| where there's almost none to show that video visitation is in any way an adequate substitute for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Well, I wanted to dig down a little deeper into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| I have a report here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| It's from the Volume 17 of the Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Law Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| This was called Moving Visitation Forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| It was done by Houston State University, Arizona State University, Florida State University, and George Mason University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| Now, there are hundreds of studies that show all the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| In-person visitation makes people commit offenses less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| It hooks them up with the families that they were dependent on to stay with afterwards so our tax dollars don't have to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| It hooks them up with their potential employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| This has been found in countless studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I think I might have found two corporate studies that said doing it through pay-per-view Skype, knock-off Skype,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| was in any way an adequate substitute for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| But let's talk about the studies that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| This is from the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| As mass imprisonment continues to dominate American crime policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| prison visitation has received increased scholarly attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| As a key source of social support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| prison visitation allows inmates to interact and communicate with loved ones over significant periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Such meaningful contact can help minimize the pains of imprisonment while providing prisoners with an important coping resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| Visits also provide inmates and their visitors a chance to maintain or rebuild relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| an opportunity to plan for release with respect to housing, employment, and other critical reintegration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| Now there are about six different studies that were in that paragraph I just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| backing up pretty much every sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| As we know, scholarly papers like this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| And given this, they say it's unsurprising that the research largely indicates that visitation is beneficial for prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Now all this is geared, every single study, is towards in-person visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| not knock-off pay-per-view Skype where if you have the money you can see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| or you can maybe go look at the box that has your loved one that's by the bathroom bolted to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| Some of the studies I would invite you to look at would be from Criminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| let's see, the American Journal of Criminal Justice, the Arizona Department of Corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| which I read the study, found that in-person visitation was an invaluable tactic for controlling issues in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2382)|
| 0:39:49| They had a tiered, four-tiered system, and people worked to behave clean and be on their best behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| so they could get to the best level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| The Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, Punishment and Society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| the University of Chicago Press, Victims and Offenders, the Arizona Sentencing Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| There's one from Federal Probation, Family Ties During Imprisonment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| Do They Influence Future Criminal Activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| The Lancet, the Washington, D.C. Urban Institute, Stanford, California University Press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| the Bureau of Justice Statistics Report, the Prison Journal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| the International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| I could burn up all my time pointing at a hundred years worth of studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| that show the positive effects of in-person visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| which, by the way, ending was supposed to free up some of our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| which apparently has not worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| So what have we gotten for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| The only reason, the only thing that this pay-per-view policy does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| the only cents it makes is dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We are commodifying citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Apparently up to 70% have not been convicted of a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| They have been commodified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| They're using this to make money off them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| And I've brought up tons of studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2462)|

| 0:41:32| productive citizens into our town for a very highly questionable practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2492)|

| 0:41:41| And I would submit, you know, this is a democratic process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2501)|

| 0:41:49| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| All right, thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Okay, we are now at the point of our county commission agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| where we take amendments to our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| and set the agenda for this month's work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| which will in turn affect the actual county commission meeting next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| As indicated on the county commission forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| there are several items that I've taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| We also have several items that we'd like to formally add to the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| I'd like to, as I've done the last two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| bring up the five items that we'd like to add for a quick vote to get them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| The first item is item number 54 that was submitted by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| That's related to a discussion on the BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| I'll call on Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| John David. Is this discussion or is this John David's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| This was the John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| You had mentioned in the formal item that it was going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| that John David was going to be here and to discuss the BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| He will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| He got tied up in some other weather delays or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| So as long as we're talking at the line item transfer, we can scratch item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| Okay, so you'd like to withdraw item 54 and discuss that during line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2589)|
| 0:43:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| What about commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| This is for setting it for next week, so he's going to be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| He won't be here. We'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| So he will not be here next week, so you're going to formally withdraw this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Yeah, John David, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| I know we've had several of the public speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Do you wish to have a substitute motion to just add it to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| or discuss that when we're talking about line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Let's wait while we add line item transfers because they know that there is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| They can come back for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| We can add it to public forum if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| Okay, we'll withdraw that then. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Okay, the next item is item 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| This was an item that was added related to the attorney fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| and a discussion of how we'd represent the county if that mattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| The chair will entertain a motion to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| All right, so moved by Commissioner Anders. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Discussion on this? I know Commissioner Schoonmaker, I see your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Just a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| I'm looking at item number 56 that met the deadline for the work session agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| why are the to-be-addeds put ahead of something that met the deadline for the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| I see there's a discussion item from Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2688)|
| 0:44:55| Do we normally do that, insert things to be added, or does it normally go after the item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| I think those items, I can't remember exactly when they end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| I think they came in maybe on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| We're voting on whether or not to add this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I'm just asking a question procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Should these be realigned to where they're in proper order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Are you talking about 54, 55, 56, just in proper numerical order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Yes, because 56 was actually there prior to the other two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| I now understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| You know what, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| We can, if this body would prefer to add 54 and 55 after 56, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2731)|
| 0:45:38| Either way, I just want to make sure these items get added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| I'm sorry if we didn't catch that when we were making the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Usually, I think you are correct, they should have probably been added afterwards since they were to-be-adds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| Anyhow, back to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| The whole point of this workshop is to set the agenda for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Once we set the agenda for next week and we decide what's on and what's off, it doesn't matter what number it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| The motion before us is to add item 55 to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Add item 55, and if it comes before 56 or 58 or 22, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| Let's decide to add it or not and move on with our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| All in favor of adding item 55 to the agenda, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2782)|

| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| The next item, there are three items that I'm suggesting we add tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| One, I received a letter of resignation from Commissioner Wright Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| No surprise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| So, we do need to add that as a spread of record item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| All in favor of adding that item to agenda, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Excuse me, I need a motion to add that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2808)|

| 0:46:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| Second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2814)|

| 0:46:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| I'd also like to add for next week's meeting an honorary resolution honoring Commissioner Wright for his service on commission and serving as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2821)|
| 0:47:11| The chair will entertain a motion to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2835)|

| 0:47:18| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2841)|

| 0:47:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| The next item I'd like to add, once again pursuant to Commissioner Wright's formal resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| is dates for a public hearing and an appointment of a commissioner to replace Commissioner Wright in his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2852)|
| 0:47:41| I'd like to add that on as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| You don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| Well, we don't need to, so we'll just add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| That covers the ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Item 58 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| Item 42 will be deferred a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Go ahead, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I guess maybe this is the time I could ask Chris Caldwell from our finance to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| I've got to review the non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| The items that have been pulled from consent are items 5, 12, 21, item 28, item 35 and 37,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2905)|
| 0:48:40| and items 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2920)|
| 0:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Can I have a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2934)|

| 0:49:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| I wanted to add a discussion item for the schools about just some clarification on the SSOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| why a lot of them haven't been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| And the other thing I'd like to do is look at item number 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| and talk to Public Works about some things that we do with roads that we should maybe attend to when we accept them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2960)|
| 0:49:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| So we'll be adding a discussion item regarding to the SSOs, and we will be pulling item number 50 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2973)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Are there any other changes or additions for the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Could I get a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=2988)|

| 0:50:06| The next item on the agenda is approval of the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Do we have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Moved by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3017)|

| 0:50:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| We'll next move into the school part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| For those of you who may be our guests or haven't attended a meeting, at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| in the agenda, the county clerk's office will be assisting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| The first item is item number five, resolution 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| It's approving a student space flight experiments program, SSEP, agreement with the National| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| Center for Earth and Space Science Education for the Knox County schools to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| in SSEP mission 13 to the International Space Station at a cost of $24,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3067)|

| 0:51:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| Frankly, I pulled this one just because I thought it was really interesting and thought the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| public might find something else with space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Is there someone from the schools who could address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3089)|
| 0:51:30| Dr. Laura Denton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| I'm the grants manager for Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| Anything in particular you'd like to know or just a general overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Tell me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Is this where we have our students do experiments and then they get to go up to the space station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| If you could elaborate on that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| We invite schools to participate and schools who choose to, they have their kids really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| design and experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Last year we sent a tooth to space to look at how gravity impacted healing in a tooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| So it runs the gamut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Things that we would probably never even dream of trying to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| And the kids do a great job of coming up with the experiment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| They design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| They compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| And we've had one chosen for every mission I think that we've competed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| That's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Any other questions for my fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Next item is number 12, resolution 208.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| It's authorizing the acceptance of the Education Innovation and Research Grant Award from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| U.S. Department of Education in the amount of $2,405,543| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| with required matching funds of $416,672| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| covered by preexisting budget salaries, benefits, and occupancy costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| for the term of October 1st through September 30th, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| for the Think About It Systematically Preparing Students for the Workforce Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| If you could address this, I know that whenever we get a grant for over $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| it's probably in the public's interest just to find out a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| So if you could please address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| Go ahead and name and address for the record again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Laura Denton, Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| This grant is a federal U.S. Department of Education Education Innovation and Research Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| It's actually a pretty distinguished award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| There were 280-something applicants, and we were one of 18 awardees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| So essentially, in a nutshell, what we're going to do in Knox County Schools is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| starting with five schools next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| we'll enroll fifth graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| In years two, we'll enroll third through fifth graders at ten Knox County Elementary schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| and work with them throughout the year, beginning in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| and including camps throughout the school year ending in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| to work essentially on STEM skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| And these young people also have the opportunity to partner with local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| We've involved our CTE folks and have partner businesses coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| to work with these students to have essentially a capstone project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| in hopes of not only increasing science and STEM proficiency in students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| but also increasing their interest in STEM careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| both in the academic college-bound sector and also in the CTE side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| I saw Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| What schools are we starting with first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| So we proposed five schools initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| We had to name schools in the application, and once we got funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| we went back and said, okay, we got funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Here's where we're going forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Currently, we have Ball Camp, Bell-Morris, Cedar Bluff Elementaries signed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3288)|
| 0:54:58| So we have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| How many years is this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| It's a five-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| So the federal fiscal year runs October 1 to September 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| So it's October 1 of 2018, so we're actually a little bit into year one technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| and we'll run until September 30 of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Is the $2 million in grant yearly, or is that a one-time to cover five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| It will be a yearly, and it's a yearly amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| and they vary slightly for the total of $2.405,543.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3325)|
| 0:55:30| Is the program successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Have you all looked at ways to keep funding this after the grant runs out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| So this project requires, by federal statute, an independent evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3334)|
| 0:55:40| and so we will be able to know in four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| we could come back and say this is how successful this has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| and at that point it really allows you to look at a cost-benefit and to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| you know, we want to extend it because it's given us these benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| or we tried it, it didn't do exactly what we thought it would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| Are there any positions that will have to be hired to fulfill this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| that aren't currently on payroll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| There is one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| It's a facilitator-level position, and that's the sole position that will be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| There are teacher stipends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| If you look at the budget, there's a lot of stipend money for curriculum development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| and for the actual instruction pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Those will be existing, you know, staff people who do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| much like we've done summer school in the past or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| You don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Motion to approve by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| And do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| It came from, where did that, was that Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| I can second, but I had just one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| So when we do the first five initial schools, will the, oh, wellness schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Give her a second to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| After the first five initial schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| and we move to the adding additional five schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| will the benchmark be taken at the five-year mark of those five initial schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| or after we do the ten schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| How would your assessment be done at the five-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| at the five schools that you've identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Well, we will look at all ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| And it's really at a student level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| So we may have, you know, Johnny who does it for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| Or we may have Sue who comes in as a third grader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| and actually does the program for three consecutive years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| So it's really at a student level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| Any other questions or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| We good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3454)|
| 0:57:35| I'll now entertain a, I believe we had a motion from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| and a second was that from Commissioner Gill on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| The next item is number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| It's Resolution 217,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| a resolution approving the Knox County Schools Certified Retirement Incentive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| Motion to approve by Commissioner Smith and a second was by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| If we could have someone from the school system talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| My name is Kelly Drummond, 7127 Presidential Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3501)|
| 0:58:22| Thank you, Ms. Drummond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Can you share with us just a little bit about this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Is there any information in particular that you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| or would you like a general overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| I think a general overview would probably suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| The Retirement Incentive Plan will go into effect if it's approved by the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| and it will go into effect November 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| It is currently we have approximately 688 individuals that are eligible for the Retirement Incentive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| That information will be presented to those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| and they will have until January 19th to complete their interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| and their forms to indicate that they're interested in retiring with the Early Incentive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| The Early Incentive Plan would allow for their individual retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| to be paid for them for up to 14 years or to the age of 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| if they are eligible for this Retirement Incentive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Yes, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Who was the first light on this when I saw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| Was it Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Is this something that the schools routinely do every so many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| or what's the purpose for bringing this on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| And I ask that because the general vibe has been we need more teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| and here you have 688 people that may have an opportunity to walk and have less teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| So why this and why now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| It is a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| It is not something that has been offered prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| It is something that we are looking at to reward individuals who have had long-term service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| who are interested in retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| It's an opportunity to provide that incentive for those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3607)|
| 1:00:12| The plan is also set up to encourage individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| who are interested in potentially coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| There's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| But if they're interested in potentially coming back to serve in a part-time capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| so we do not lose their knowledge and their ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| but we would like to incentivize and encourage individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| who provided long-term service to the district to have that opportunity to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| while also encouraging individuals who have the interest in coming on to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| So while there is a need for individual teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| there's an opportunity that some of these individuals may be able to retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| and we may not need to replace some of those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| But it is not a pure system just to remove individuals as a retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| If somebody chose to retire but then come back in that part-time capacity that you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| would they be compensated additionally and their retirement continue in a part-time capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| or do they essentially then stop that because they're coming back into the employment of the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| No, sir. You would not come out of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| You can come back in a part-time capacity and teach two classes or a half-time basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| and would not need to come out of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| It would also provide the district with not a loss of that knowledge and that certification area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| but it also would allow us to be able to get that information and get those classes taught at a higher capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| So we would be able to bring potentially two part-time teachers back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| and they would be able to cover a full load in a high school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| And my last question, and I'll give up the floor, thank you for indulging me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| is how does this benefit the children in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| It benefits the children in Knox County because we would have individuals who are interested in retiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| but who, because of financial reasons, did not choose to retire, but they have the opportunity to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| It also encourages for the potential for new individuals to come in into the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| who may be interested in coming into the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I've got multiple commissioners that would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| The order that I saw the lights in was Smith, Daly, Bussler, Biggs, Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| So, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Mr. Chairman, I'll go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| You'll what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I'll go last, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Okay, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| I'm along the same thinking as Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| that we're hard-pressed to get teachers, we're wanting teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| and we say we lose teachers to Alcoa, Oak Ridge, wherever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| and it's beyond me that we, and I want people to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| I retired to become a full-time county commissioner, and I love being a full-time county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| I'm crazy, but I do love this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| But I'm along the same thinking as Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| The last time we offered an early retirement was for the Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| and I think we went above projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| What is your projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Do you think it's going to be 50%, 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| Out of the 688 individuals, we forecast approximately 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3808)|
| 1:03:34| On an annual basis, we have, on average, 125 individuals that retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| So we believe that number will increase by approximately 200 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Is this number, are we saving anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| I guess the question is, with early retirement and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| and then still having to hire part-time teachers, is the school system saving money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Or is this, what is the reasoning, basically the reasoning behind this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Is it just so a teacher can retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| It does have the potential for savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| and I'm going to ask Mr. Joe Snyder to talk about that or Mr. Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| But it does have the potential for saving the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| and that is one of the benefits to the district for the cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| Even if we replace individuals at a half-time basis, there is a potential for savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| If we do not determine out of the attrition rate that we don't need to replace those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| through restructuring and reorganization, there's an additional savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| But I'm going to ask Mr. Joe Snyder to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Joe Snyder, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| And I'm sorry, Commissioner, can you repeat the last part of your question there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| The question was about how many do we expect, around 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| And is the reasoning behind it, is there a cost savings there if these 350 retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| And if so, what, in your opinion, might that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| And then the second part of that question was answered about the part-time teacher coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| So budgetarily speaking, like Dr. Drummond was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| it depends on whether that position is lost through attrition, through some restructuring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| or whether it is, in fact, replaced by a new teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Our estimation is that in the event where a retiree is replaced by a new teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| you're looking at gaining $12,000 to $15,000 per position that retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Obviously, if it's lost through attrition, you're losing the full dollar value of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| The second part of that is for every new hire that you have that replaces someone that retires right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3937)|
| 1:05:43| Most of you all are aware of our TCRS legacy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| Our employer contribution to that is 10.46% for every teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3947)|
| 1:05:54| Any new hire is under our hybrid plan, which is at a reduced cost to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| So there is some budgetary savings there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Next would be Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| I had some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| This sounds sort of like in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| It's been going on for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| They used to call it the golden handshake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| And the object of that type of program was to get rid of some of the higher paid employees in the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3977)|
| 1:06:28| Now, I know this is not a company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| This is a school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| So you could put more what we call where the rubber meets the road, those people in those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| So you took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| And that was that goal for that, is to reduce that overhead cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| So are you saying basically the same thing, we're just targeting teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| No, it's not unique to just teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| It's anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| So anybody up through there could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Right, anyone that's on the certified retirement TCRS would be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| So potentially supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| And so what you're saying is if those people retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4026)|
| 1:07:09| and those are some of the places that you can combine their, not authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4029)|
| 1:07:17| but their work with other departments, then you will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| So you will start consolidating down and make it more lean, mean, and fight machine, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| So hopefully as part of this process, we would evaluate those situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| and where possible restructure to make it more efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| So, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Next was Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Is this something new, having teachers retire and they come back on contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Are there other positions that do this in the Knox County school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Or is this kind of something, a new program you're trying out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| So, no, we do have currently, in order to increase our pool for substitute teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4078)|
| 1:08:08| we actually incentivize certified retired teachers that want to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| and still participate in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| and they can work a certain number of days throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| and still draw their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| So that part of it is not new to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| So a principal could retire and come back and substitute teach if he or she felt the need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| And the second part of my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| will they be getting the benefits package insurance and stuff like that if they come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| So will that kind of cost them a little bit more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| So if they retire and then come back and work on a time card basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| they would not be a benefited employee at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| So there's some additional savings there for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Is that Commissioner Biggs, you're done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Yeah, I want to reemphasize that, what Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| So if they retire and they come back and teach part-time, they cannot get any additional benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| Their retirement is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| They come back, they do part-time, they only get paid for the hours they're instructing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| And then the other thing is I know in a lot of the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| particularly trying to get younger teachers and all those that are graduating into the workforce and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4164)|
| 1:09:33| I know sometimes they have to get moved around year after year, and particularly in a certain school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4173)|
| 1:09:42| They could teach fifth grade one year, third grade one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| and they won't get a permanent position until a teacher retires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| So say a teacher takes this early retirement, that teacher that's been waiting for someone to retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4190)|
| 1:10:02| would they get that permanent spot or have to still worry, or would you put in part-time teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4202)|
| 1:10:12| I think I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| When a new teacher comes on board for the beginning of a new school year, they're hired into a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| If they come into a position mid-year at another time, they're coming in as an interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| and they may be taking over someone else's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| So I'm not sure if you're just talking about being moved from that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| No, I'm talking about a teacher I know several that have taught in a certain school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| And one year they'll teach fifth grade, and then they have an opening for fourth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and then the next year they'll have second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| So they don't get to be, say, a kindergarten teacher or a second grade teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| until somebody retires in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| If the individual retires out of the school, out of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| then they can apply and be eligible for that full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| Well, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| I would hope that they would be able to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| and that we wouldn't let retiring teachers in that school and then use the part-times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4272)|
| 1:11:19| and not let someone be a regular second grade teacher or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| Yes, ma'am, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| The 688 individuals that are eligible, what percentage of your workforce is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| So total certified work base, you're talking about approximately 4,500 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| So percentage that up, 15 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Potential of losing 15% of your workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Of the certified workforce, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| If all of them took the incentive, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| And then I was reading your documents that were submitted to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Do you have a copy of your CRIP plan in front of you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| No, I do not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Well, you may want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| On page 2, you have the conditions of ineligibility, and you list A, B, and C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| and then you go to the next page, and it says F, G, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| So is there some parts to that document that are missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| I will have Mr. Scott Bolton from Employee Relations to double check that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| and will submit the corrected documents to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Is that it, Mr. Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Does this affect our collaborative conferencing agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| and if you could speak to that issue to bring people up to speed about what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| The collaborative conferencing is our MOU with KCEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4379)|
| 1:13:06| and it is our partnership through collaborative conferencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| and it allows for us to have a conference with the employees, the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4390)|
| 1:13:18| excuse me, the teachers, and with management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| And so we have spoken to KCEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| KCEA rep has been involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| We have presented this information to KCEA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| and all of the representatives to have that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| and it does not require approval from KCEA to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Mr. Bolton has been working on this for many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| and has had a lot of thought put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| One thing this will enable us to do is we all know through our BP formula our position count is way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| This will give us an opportunity to restructure some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| and also many of you all know that teaching is a very, very hard profession that grinds on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4446)|
| 1:14:13| and this will give an opportunity to some of our teachers that, for a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| may be burned out to retire early so that we can hire some younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| more energetic people into these positions, which will also mean savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| This is not something that's just come up in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| They've been working on this a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| You do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| All opposed say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4489)|
| 1:14:59| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Is there something you wanted to talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| No, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| Or immediately thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4517)|
| 1:15:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Next item for consideration is, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Item number 28, resolution 305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| And I'll be reading the revised caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| It is a resolution approving a contract with Correct Care Solutions for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| provision of professional mental health services for Knox County inmates for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| the period beginning December 3, 2018, and ending November 30, 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| in the amount of $418,821 for the first year of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| with slight increases each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I'd like to make a motion to send without recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| since we've got a new caption or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| There's a motion to send with no recommendation from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| and it's been seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4571)|
| 1:16:13| Hugh said that somebody was ‑‑ Hugh said from the sheriff's office said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| that there was somebody here to speak to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| if anybody had any questions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| So I'm going to let that go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| It's fairly new to us, since we just got it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Well, I know that Jill just recently handed us the new resolution with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| change in the caption on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| Also, I pulled this one on in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| mainly because it's related to mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| and wanted to find out if there's any insight to this that the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| department could bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| Is this for mental health professionals to be working in the jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| I'm not sure exactly what this was related to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| but I thought Sheriff Spangler might be able just to give us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| more insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| I know that we've had some visitors talk a lot about mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| and I thought that this was a relevant item to shed a little bit of light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Sheriff Spangler, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| And that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| It's for our detention facility, our jail facilities, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| all three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| And what it is, it is a contract that came up for rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| And so Helen Ross McNabb had that contract that did not bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| This was the only bid that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| So that's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Is there any other discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| The motion on the table is to send forward with no recommendation that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| require being voted on at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4667)|
| 1:17:54| Item number 35 is Resolution 406,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4674)|

| 1:18:04| to provide survey and civil design services related to the extension of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| Cherahala Boulevard from Horseshoe Bend Road to Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Mr. Snowden, I'll tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| I pulled this one off the consent agenda because I remember we had a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| heated zoning discussion on this matter last year or maybe it was the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| So one of those items at that particular zoning discussion was to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| following up on this road construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So for those of us who recall that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| I thought this was a good opportunity for you to give us a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| I'd be glad to, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| Yeah, this body approved the rezoning of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| one of the properties that this road will connect to in December of 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| It went back through MPC as a use on review and concept plan in March of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| year, and now we're hopefully contracting with Gresham Smith to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| Cherahala approximately one mile from its current terminus to Horseshoe Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| to allow for better access for that development that actually is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| he is allowed to build 40 units prior to the new roadway being constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| and then after the roadway is constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| he can complete the rest of his subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| In addition to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| we'll provide better access for Faith Promise Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| which currently now has some obviously accessibility issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| So we're excited about the project and think it'll be a good safety project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| and benefit for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Is there any other discussion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| This motion is all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| Sorry, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| I just want to just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| if you could briefly speak to the timeframe, length of process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| how we will go about making sure they have the access they need and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| general information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| the very first thing we'll do before we even start much design is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| speak with Faith Promise as well as Todd Napier at the Development Corp to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| make sure that all their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| because we're actually going to install an on-ramp for them for their traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| to go northbound on Pellissippi toward Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| So that'll be the very first step in that process before we start the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| We hope to have the design and right-of-way completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| hopefully by spring of next year, summer of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| and actually start construction hopefully in the late summer of next year with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| about a year, 18-month timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| So within two to three years, the roadway will be open in service to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| This item is probably before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| The next item is number 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| It's Resolution 501, Approving Amendment No. 1 with HomeSource East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| to provide an additional $106,664 in 2016 and 2017 Home Investment Partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4865)|
| 1:21:15| Home Program funds and program income for the construction of 12 units of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| multifamily rental housing for seniors known as Willow Place II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| federally funded through HUD Home Program funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Motion for approval by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| We have Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Dwight VanDeVate, Knox County Community Development, 400 Main Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| Suite 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| Could you just, thank you, Mr. Chairman, speak to the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| Because senior housing is just extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| and the work that we do there really needs to be highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| I appreciate that, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| And this is actually one of our favorite developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| because it serves such an underserved population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| Willow Place will ultimately build out to 40 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| It's owned and operated by HomeSource of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| but Knox County, through our HUD funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| will have funded about 50% of the construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| So this development would not have been possible on this scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| without the support of the county and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| Currently 20 units exist for seniors age 55 and above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| that are 80% of HUD AMI for a single-person household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| I know that's a lot of acronyms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| but what this does is it serves very low-income seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| typically people who are living strictly on Social Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| but it maintains them in a quality of housing that would not be an option otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| Commissioner Anders, I think, can speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| It's a lovely development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| You can drive up to it, and it looks like an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| where you or I would be very comfortable having a family member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| and we're proud of the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| This will get them an additional 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| It will be 32, but we will be back to this commission at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| probably next year with additional program funds to build the final eight units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| and we'll have a total there of 40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| and we hope HomeSource will continue in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5000)|
| 1:23:29| We have 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| Now, Commissioner Carringer, did you say you wanted to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| We've got a deferred item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| I just wanted to ask if our finance director, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| has spoken to about a couple times on the deferment of the Andrew Johnson building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| because I think several are getting calls on that as to why and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| and he's got a good explanation on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| and I thought the public and all would like to know why we've kind of had to keep deferring this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| for a few months just to let it out that everyone knows why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| This month we actually had some title issues that we were working through as it relates to the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5053)|
| 1:24:19| and so we're working through those to make sure that B and A are comfortable with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| as we work through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Other than that, what we have been trying to do is correlate wherever the move is going to happen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5066)|
| 1:24:35| with the sell the A.J. at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| and so we're trying to make sure that those at least are close in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| and so more of a timing issue than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Yes, and so I kind of understood, too, before we vote to sell it or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| so that we know exactly what's happening and what we're really voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| what's going to be moving in, and just all the transition that we know about with this sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| Yes, we think it's a lot easier to bring everything at once if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| If we get to a place to where it's just a special call meeting on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| and really only other than that's okay, but at least we want it to be close in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| And I just want to make sure that the information occurs prior to us making a decision upon it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5123)|
| 1:25:32| if we could have an assessment of what the school system needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| and I don't know if it's funneled through the education committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| to really make sure we understand what our needs are, what the school system needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| how much this building costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I mean, it's been several years now, and my memory is probably not the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| but I really would like a real conversation around this deferment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| so that we are all on the same page at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| The chair believes, as this item has been deferred for another month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| the appropriate time and place for this would be when it is up for a final vote for us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| hopefully in advance, get all the information to share with all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| If there's so much of it, we can post on the form and try to call a specially called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| if it looks like it may require a lot of extra looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| But at this time, the item before us is really just a deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| And at the same time, will we be provided the information of how much capital improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| that the county has already put into the Andrew Johnson building since we purchased it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| I'm sure that we probably need to check with Mr. Caldwell and schools and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| Honestly, I don't know, but I know that it would all be relevant information to get as we weigh that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5206)|
| 1:26:55| Okay. Moving on. Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| Item number 45, resolution 901, is accepting the courtroom security report for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| and requesting the chair of the court security committee to issue the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| to the administrative office of the courts on behalf of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| pursuant to Tennessee Code annotated subsection 16-2-505D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| Okay. Is there a motion for approval on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Okay. There's a motion to approve by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5242)|
| 1:27:26| This item came to us from Mike Hammond for us to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| Do any of the commissioners wish to discuss this item, or we can just pass it forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| Okay. Seeing no discussion, this item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| All opposed, please say nay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Item number 47 is resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| It's approving the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knox to enter into a payment in lieu of tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| pilot transaction with Orange-Knoxville-Cumberland LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| with respect to certain property located at 2223 Cumberland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| Can I have a motion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| Okay. There's a motion to send with no recommendation from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| It was seconded by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Okay. Is there any discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| I know I'd like to probably get Mr. Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| I want to find out what the will of this body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Would we like to do most of the discussion on this item next week, or how much discussion would this body like to do tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5315)|
| 1:28:43| Frankly, I'm open this floor up for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Well, I think after speaking with Mr. Meadows and reading through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| but, you know, really this item is before us only because of the fact that it's a new law that got passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| And so it's passed the but-for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| You know, I'm not a big fan of a retail TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| This is really not a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| But with the constraints that the new zoning has placed and the construction requirements on the strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| I think this is kind of going to be the way of the redevelopment down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| And so I don't know that, I mean, I'm satisfied with the answers that I've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| I just, I think the public needs to know the only reason it's come before us is because it's a new law that they were unaware of affecting this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5361)|
| 1:29:31| So that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| We have a light from both Commissioner Carringer and Commissioner Schoonmaker and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| I'm not sure which of you two rang in first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| I'll go in the order of Commissioner Schoonmaker, then Carringer, then Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Since Mr. Meadows is already here this evening, why don't we go ahead and get his quick overview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| just so to kind of go into detail exactly what Commissioner Anders was referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| that this was all basically all been done paperwork-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| There just was a difference in the way the state law that came into effect the date of initiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5405)|
| 1:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Yes, I agree what Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Schoonmaker also stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| We have all the city officials here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| I see Mr. Lyon and Mr. Emmett and maybe some other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| So it is going to be kind of multi-level use and all for, I think, housing and CVS and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5432)|
| 1:30:41| What we'll do, if it's what this body desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| we will ask Mr. Meadows to share with us kind of a big picture on this project and why it's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5444)|
| 1:30:53| And, Mr. Meadows, I'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| If you could formally state your name and address for the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| Greg Meadows, 3015 Keller Bend Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| I represent Orange Knoxville Cumberland in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| Would it be possible to flash up to put up that project rendering we discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5468)|
| 1:31:15| If I could, I'll speak to the project first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| and then if I might the second to address what Commissioner Anders had mentioned in terms of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5477)|
| 1:31:26| The project itself is a total cost of $74 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| It is a multi-tenant facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| It's 88% of the income of the project is student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| 12% of it is the CVS that you see in this rendering at the hard corner of 22nd and Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5504)|
| 1:31:53| From a square footage standpoint, the CVS represents about 7% of the square feet of the total project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5513)|
| 1:32:02| and the student housing is roughly 199,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| The reason I mention that I'll come back to when we get to why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| The project itself has been one that we've been working on for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5533)|
| 1:32:32| What we were hoping to do is to start construction the second week of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| with completing the project for turnover for the school year for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| That would be in July of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| We are at the process and are permitting for the project that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| aside from satisfying bonding requirements and certain other prerequisites for issuance of those permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| those are ready to be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| The project itself consists of the CVS and the retail component, an underground level of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| a second level of parking that's on the same level as the CVS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| and then a third level of parking that's just above or adjacent to the CVS you see in the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| Above those three levels is the podium for the student housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| It's a difficult site from a topo standpoint, from rock, soils, and the construction phasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5599)|
| 1:33:27| We have put together a plan with Children's Hospital that owns the parking garage behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| to coordinate construction activities in a way that will minimize the impact to traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| and minimize the impact to their shift changes that use that parking facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| So in accommodating the project, there's been some significant challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| that led to us going through the pilot process with the city and the city IDB and third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| The third-party review was done by Municap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Their determination was that the project would not be able to move forward without the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| and that with the pilot, the project would not achieve a return that was above what they consider to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5644)|
| 1:34:13| So from a timing standpoint, the pilot was approved by city council in April of 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| and then was approved by the city IDB a couple of months thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| In October 1, a statute amendment went in place to the pilot statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| that basically says that if your project contains a retail component, of which, again, ours does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| If you look at square footage, it's roughly 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| If you look at net operating income, it's roughly 12% consisting of the CVS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| If you add that retail component and the pilot is for more than 10 years, it requires both city and county approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5687)|
| 1:34:55| And so we're before you asking for that approval and would have liked to have been before you earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| We were honestly caught by surprise at the effective date of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| From a timing standpoint, we are under contract with the equity folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| to have to close and start construction the second week of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| and that's our concern and why we had asked for going to commission on the 19th of November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| instead of your December 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| Is there anything I can answer about the project or the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| No, but I've got a question for Mr. Caldwell, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5737)|
| 1:35:46| He's back there in the huddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5746)|
| 1:35:58| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| This being brought before us and I see that there's a deadline in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I just want to see how finance feels about it, what your opinions are in the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| if the mayor has any discussions about it so we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| Since we're discussing it tonight, we won't have to discuss this next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| We got this the same time you all did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| The mayor had a conversation with Bill Lyons from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| through how that process worked from them filling out the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| going through third-party review for a 15-year pilot, and just went through the general steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| And so since it has passed city council, has been through third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| I think the only change here is the change in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| So before that, it wouldn't even come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| I think that's why it's late getting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| But other than that, I can't speak for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| I think he was comfortable, but I think he would have liked to have had more time to review it, as would we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5825)|
| 1:37:14| But ultimately, knowing that the city's been through this process for a period of time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| I mean, they do the same process that we would do on these as it relates to third-party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5841)|
| 1:37:28| So from that standpoint, from finances standpoint, we're comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5848)|
| 1:37:35| I would like to give Mayor Jacobs time if he would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| I mean, it's up to the mayor to – thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5857)|
| 1:37:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| And I'll just echo what Chris said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| He basically summed up my thoughts on it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| It would have been nice to have more time to look at this, but I'm comfortable with what the city did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| I agree with Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| Normally this would be more problematic, but because of the changes in the law and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| I think it's appropriate in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I've got three lights on, I recognize, in order that I noticed them, which is Anders, Gill, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| This is my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| You're second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| So Commissioner Gill, then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| I think Commissioner Smith, he's first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| I wanted to hear from the city and the financial effects moving from that pilot from 10 to 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| and the process that the city unfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| I'm Bill Lyons, city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Thank you, commissioners, for considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| We, too, were concerned, I'll say, about the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| I'll get right out in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| We wanted to be able to have a little more time to begin this new process of pilots coming to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| because this was a factor of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| We were a little surprised that this one was captured because we'd voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| The city council had voted on it a number of times, had IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| It just needed to come back because of some technical issues, and that forced this back to October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| And we would have liked to have been able to wait until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| But as you heard from Mr. Meadows, there are factors at work that really causes great difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5961)|
| 1:39:28| Our consideration of this, as with all these pilots, goes to a lot of scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5968)|
| 1:39:36| This has to do with Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| where you can't even tell from this picture as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| This is an incredibly difficult site, up hard up against the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| It's been non-producing for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| The whole code at Cumberland Avenue encourages much more dense development such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| and is going to eventually put a whole lot on both the city and county tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Obviously, that will be deferred during the pilot process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| We see this as a real investment of being stewards of the long-term tax bases of both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| In terms of the length of the pilot, obviously, I would hope it would be obvious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| we would not want to grant a year longer than we think is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| And when we go through the third-party review, our instructions are to Municap, who performs this for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| give us the absolute minimum amount of years necessary to make this project bankable and feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6024)|
| 1:40:35| The necessity of dealing with structured parking on a very difficult site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| makes this project really upside down without any consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| And they came back with the 15 years, which they said put it in a questionable mode anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| relative to the risk and the ultimate return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| We would have loved for it to have been able to function within 10 years, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| but 15 really is the absolute minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| And we press pretty hard with them on all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Every once in a while, we can squeeze another year or two out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| But in this case, we're convinced that given the challenges of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| we're very thrilled to be able to use this, to have a great use of this space and to enhance the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| But we think it will take 15 years of pilot for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you. And I know we just finished Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| And the accessibility and the traffic of such a large-scale project is going to be a challenge to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6081)|
| 1:41:30| And how are we going to address that issue? Because I'd still like to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| Yes, a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Now, Cumberland, we're really changing greatly the intensity of the development there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| And we've already got $190 million of new investment since we've had that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| And much of that is on the tax rolls already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| Others will be coming on later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| We've had some other pilots and one TIF, especially for University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6111)|
| 1:41:56| All of them present traffic challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| If you notice the building, I think you were at the ribbon-cutting at First Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| There had been an extension through the light into that building to enable that parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| We're requiring that we don't have anywhere else for these cars to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| The developments have to be able to handle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| And that means an awful lot of structured parking, means some difficulty in entrance and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| And part of the problems I think Mr. Meadows probably would be glad to speak about or bemoan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| was we had design after design for them to be able to get that parking in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| and to be able to come up with something that we thought worked with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| There were many design challenges for that, especially when you had a retail component as well as the residential component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| We see students living there as mostly it's car storage rather than parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| because the whole idea is they come, they put their cars, and then they walk or bike and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| The retail does add some challenges to that because there will be some in and out onto Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| So that is a challenge with every one of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| We think we've met them well, but unfortunately for the developer, it adds a good amount of expense to make these work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| I do understand the time constraint on this, and I do understand that the state law was changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| and this is only before us because of, I believe, either a name change or some technical things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| that need to be corrected on what the city council had passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| But usually the state, when they make laws, they make them for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| And I'm sorry you all got caught up in this, and I'm really not appreciative of the fact that four days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| this landed in my email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| But I do, I can't appreciate the crunch you're all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| On Cumberland Avenue, how many student housing projects have been given polits or tiffs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| Oh, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| Third one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| This is, there's probably been, on Cumberland itself, there was, what, 1830, that 10 that we were just in, that was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| This would be number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| And then just off Cumberland, there's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Just off of Cumberland, you had the standard, which is the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6252)|
| 1:44:13| And then one on the south side of the river, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| That is within the, that has not, that is within the tiff district set up a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| but the project itself didn't get the tiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| Supporting the infrastructure in that old area is what received, it's a little different operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6268)|
| 1:44:34| but that's part of the tiff district, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| So in the Cumberland Avenue area, since it's been redone, I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| is the form-based concept and design necessitating the fact that people will have to have tiffs and pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| in order to develop there in this district now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I would say not completely, but it does contribute a lot because of the necessity of structured parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6292)|
| 1:45:00| to support these developments, which would not be able to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6300)|
| 1:45:05| So we wouldn't have the projects near at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| They would be somewhere else and probably, or the students would just be somehow dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| But the form-based code and the necessity of having this degree of density mandating structured parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| to make it work is largely behind these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Now, I would say that the pilots have been lesser in time on the standard, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| was significantly lesser because the construction challenges were much fewer there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| than we have at this project with Orange Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Okay, and I guess I'll make this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| As a free market kind of guy, I sometimes get a little confused when you have a ready-made market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| that has made it necessary to build four student housing units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| but yet everybody still needs assistance in doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Commissioner Anders, you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| Once again, the motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation for a vote that would take place next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6364)|
| 1:46:13| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| All opposed, nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Okay, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| Oh, sorry, I looked down at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Can I bring a point up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| I asked a question that was going to ask to the school people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| and we've already covered their agenda about talking to SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| And I see them standing back there, and I don't know if they're getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| They're not paid by the hour because I think they got paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| So what you're saying is, you know, usually we add those out at the end, so you'd like, if possible, we can add it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| Could we do that and be a little bit kinder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| I'd like to be a little bit kinder to you all at least once, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| So could we, just let me address that, could I, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Go right ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| Okay, we have on the agenda here, or what you have on your website, some things about SSOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| and how they are to be approved, and there's a reason why they have to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| If you look at the, let me pull it up here, there's a lot of yellow markings on this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6440)|
| 1:47:29| which means, to me, it means they haven't accomplished reestablishing themselves as true SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6449)|
| 1:47:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Yes, sir, there's still some reporting requirements on school support organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| and not all of those organizations have completed those requirements yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| So, you know, Garrett Radin is not with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| He's our supervisor of student activity funds and overseas student support organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| But primarily that's the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| And the reason why I bring it up, I think there's going to be more thorough looking at these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| And these schools, it's very simple on how they redo their reports every year like they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6491)|
| 1:48:19| It's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| It's not hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| It just takes just a little bit of time to make them legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| And we get hit on those by our audits every time because of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| And if I'm looking at this correctly, it looks like there is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6512)|
| 1:48:40| it looks like well over 60% of them have not redone their SSOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6520)|
| 1:48:46| and they have to be that way for them to exist, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| And we did that two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| I brought that up, and it seems to have got worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Is there a reason for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| I'm not sure there's a reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| I know it's probably a little bit cumbersome, I guess, for the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| But it is a requirement, and I know we're looking at it much more seriously, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6544)|
| 1:49:10| in terms of you must comply with those requirements in order for us to approve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6550)|
| 1:49:17| I guess there's been some instances this year that at least three of those SSOs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| have been looked at where their money has disappeared, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6561)|
| 1:49:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| I think there has been some monies that maybe it's not accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| So, again, it's the oversight, a little bit looser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| I mean, we're not over the support organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| but we are responsible for making sure they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| I just don't want to be in the liability of somebody saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| I gave $5,000 and it disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| Who's going to pay me back for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Why it hasn't been used properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| And it can be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| I mean, it can be problematic to us down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| So thank you for your attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| And, Mr. Chairman, may I say one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Not related to this item, but I do appreciate the commission approving the retirement incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| But before you go on, I've got two lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| I've got a light on from Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| We want to ask about the students at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6618)|
| 1:50:19| So while you're here, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| I was just going to say thank you for approving the retirement incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| And one other statement about that maybe wasn't real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| I know the board is concerned about trying to find monies to put into the salary schedule to enhance teacher pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6630)|
| 1:50:37| So any savings that the discussion will be with any savings with the retirement incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| we hope to improve salary and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| I know we've had quite a few teachers leave just this year and go to adjoining school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6645)|
| 1:50:52| And we've got a great teacher workforce, and we need to try to improve and enhance those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| And this is a way to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| And, plus, they're looking at maybe even adding a step on the salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| It's entirely voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| We're not trying to run people off, but people that wish to leave, it could be especially a job share situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| maybe in a high school where right now on a block schedule a teacher might teach three out of four periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6673)|
| 1:51:19| But if you job share, you could have two math teachers and one teach two blocks in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| and maybe one teach two blocks in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| You gain some efficiency with that as well as the teachers making a little bit more money with their retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6687)|
| 1:51:34| and doing a job share situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Superintendent Thomas, here's what I'd like to do just for a quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| I heard Commissioner Gill say that she wanted to get an update on the carbon monoxide situation at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| So while we're here, that would probably be an appropriate time to give us a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| But I also want to share with my fellow commissioners, some of us have been going for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| We had a meeting before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| What I think might be appropriate, and I will take a look around the room, would be to have a recess for ten minutes at 7 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6719)|
| 1:52:08| because there are still some other items on this if anyone needs to take a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| Seeing any, I'll just look around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| I seem to be seeing heads nodded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| So go ahead if you could provide an update on that Lonsdale situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| Sir, I know Mr. Oakes is here with us, but we have an all clear on Lonsdale back in school today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| Maintenance made the repairs yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| I know we were very cautious about checking everything out yesterday, but the repairs were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| We were cleared to open up and functioning as normal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| I just wanted to point out that Garrett Rader has been working very, very hard on this SSO organization registration problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| This is something that our auditors have hit us year after year on, and I know for a fact that he's been working diligently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6773)|
| 1:53:00| And it's not on the school's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| It's on the organization's, not stepping forward and redoing their application and providing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6782)|
| 1:53:11| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Commissioner Carringer, I saw Carringer, Biggs, and then Bussler on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| Okay, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| We're not talking about retirement or any of that right now, just with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| I just wanted to say thank you to our school board and for our superintendent, Bob Thomas, for having the commissioners go out this past Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6806)|
| 1:53:37| Some of us went to Ader and Burnett, and some were able to go over to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| And those of us that could not make Lonsdale, our District 1 school board has already reached out to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| and given us some dates and times that we can go visit Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| But I just wanted to say thank you all, and this is just one of the pictures that we got from one of the Ader and Burnett students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6832)|
| 1:54:01| And, you know, it just brings it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| It doesn't matter what area of town you're in, kids are kids, and they all have the same needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| And I just hope as a county we can move forward and make sure that all of our Knox County schools can contribute and give to every student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6851)|
| 1:54:23| no matter what area of town you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| So I just want to say thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| You all are working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| And I think as a commission and our school board, I want the public to know that we do want what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6870)|
| 1:54:38| And facilities also follow in line in the way our kids are able to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6878)|
| 1:54:46| But I would say Ader and Burnett staff has done an excellent job, which I've known for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| and I'm sure I know Lonsdale's has too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| So thank you all for reaching out and for us as a commission working with both of them to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6905)|
| 1:55:06| Earlier we talked about people coming back as substitute teachers and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| Is there any other contract agreements that might have, say, in administrative positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6912)|
| 1:55:24| that they come back and work for school systems, or is there a salary cap or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| Is there data that we could see maybe to look at stuff like this just in case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| Generally speaking, when someone comes back as retired, they're paid at the rate they were making when they retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6935)|
| 1:55:42| So, again, in terms of administrative positions, there's some time card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| There possibly could be some time card work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| I know we have some of our retired principals working in leadership selection-type positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| and doing some things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| So, basically, unless you're substitute teaching in a normal substitute position, you're paid substitute pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| But if we bring you back and you do an interim or temporary, say you do 60 days for a teacher on leave or 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6963)|
| 1:56:11| it would be at your daily rate that you were at when you retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Mr. Chair, I just want to go back one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| I know you all are working real hard on the SSO program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| The situation, and Garrett Radin and a couple of others, when I call for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6986)|
| 1:56:32| gives me information about where they're at percentage-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6992)|
| 1:56:38| But it's the individual, like if somebody was supporting, say, the choral department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=6998)|
| 1:56:46| or the band department and things like that, there's a lot of money goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7006)|
| 1:56:51| And it puts liability on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| But I just wanted to know what kind of pressure you can put on these organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| that you've got to do this to raise money under the names of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| And that's what I wanted to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| I'm not questioning their working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7026)|
| 1:57:09| It's the individuals that are working inside the school that I think we need to look at and put pressure on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7029)|
| 1:57:15| And how you do that, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| The ball's in your court, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| A couple of things with what the chair would like to do at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7046)|
| 1:57:30| Item number one, we do have a public hearing that was scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| When it was publicly announced, the announcement stated that it would take place at a set time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| or immediately following the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| We need to follow with that so when our work session is over, that is when we will have that public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| It will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| However, I do out of respect for this board, I know that most of us started here at 4.30 today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| so it seems appropriate to have a ten-minute recess and then dive back into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| The time is now 6.57, so I would like to ask all the commissioners to return at approximately 7.07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7082)|
| 1:58:14| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| That's ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7099)|

| 2:11:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7867)|
| 2:11:08| Statement of notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| Item number 50, consideration of the acceptance of New County Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| There is a motion by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| We accept these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| We just go ahead and said, yeah, we're going to accept these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| But they become a liability because down the road we're going to have to pave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| So why don't we look at these, what we do, a 25-year down the road paving cycle that we're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7896)|
| 2:11:44| So down the road 25 years from now we're going to have to pave these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| Shouldn't we add a little bit to the paving budget for these extra roads when we accept them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| We don't have to accept the full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7916)|
| 2:11:57| How many miles of roads are we accepting in these right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7917)|
| 2:12:02| I don't have the exact amount, Commissioner, but it's typically not too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| I would imagine in a month's time probably less than two miles on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| But those two miles cost how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7931)|
| 2:12:15| To repave a length of subdivision street, which these would, is about $120,000 per mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| And if we added just, say, a 25th of that on to your budget down to the point we got to that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| we'd have the funds there to pay for them when we had to pave them, repave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| Just a thought on how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| I'm not sure, but it would be taking care of situations down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7955)|
| 2:12:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7962)|
| 2:12:43| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Commissioner Busser, am I understanding you correctly that we should charge the developer for a future road payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| I thought the purpose of these roads were to provide access to properties that are built that we do tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| Well, we're accepting roads that are supposed to be ready for use for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7977)|
| 2:13:06| We accept the liability down the road that we're going to have to keep them up and repave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| And I don't know how we would do that, but there's some way we should get into a mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| adding a little bit more to his paving budget to take care of these roads to be paved in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=7995)|
| 2:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8005)|
| 2:13:26| Well, how about just maybe every month that we have new roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| he just has an extra light item that says what the fiscal cost is for these new roads, what it is as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8010)|
| 2:13:37| Just so you know, now it's 1.7 miles and it's going to cost X number of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| but the only trouble is it's in today's dollars, not 25 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| But we know it has a physical note to it, and we should prepare for that physical note down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| I'm sorry, I've spoken out of turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| So I think what I'm hearing from Commissioner Skinmaker is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8040)|
| 2:14:04| add a fiscal note to these when we approve roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| Mr. Snow, do you have a time machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8053)|
| 2:14:16| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8056)|
| 2:14:17| What are roads going to cost 25 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| Well, I can tell you that when I started at the county 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| it was about $25,000 to pave the same mile, and now it's $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| He's talking about trying to budget something for 25 years down the road, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8073)|
| 2:14:34| We've got the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| We've got the tax base to pave the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| Can we please move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| What was that number, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| What was your number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| What was that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8084)|
| 2:14:45| What was that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| About 20 years ago, the price of asphalt, we could pave the same road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| the 26-foot wide curb and gutter subdivision street, for about $25,000 a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| And now, currently, it's about essentially $125,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| so it's went up $100,000 per mile in roughly 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467181113?start=8104)|
