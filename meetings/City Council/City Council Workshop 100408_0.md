| 0:00:30| you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=30)|
| 0:00:42| we call this meeting this Knoxville City Council workshop on April 8th to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| order we go ahead and ask we'll open the meeting by having mr. Della Vopay do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=48)|
| 0:01:00| the pledge and mr. Brown to do an invocation first get all rise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=60)|
| 0:01:18| everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=78)|
| 0:01:36| all right um miss Wilson if you call the roll please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=96)|
| 0:01:48| All right, we do have a quorum. Councilman Bailey had called me a few minutes ago saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=108)|
| 0:02:08| he was going to be unable to get here. I don't know if we've heard. Apparently Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| knows he's going to be late, and I think we're expecting the other two. We'll see how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| goes. A couple, before we turn it over to Ms. Rojero, one quick agenda item. Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=138)|
| 0:02:28| Forum is not part of workshop agendas. I will go ahead and add that if there is no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=148)|
| 0:02:37| All right, so Public Forum is up. Let me say for the audience, we want everybody to sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| in, and there's a sign-in table, sign-in sheet on the back table. If you're interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| speaking at Public Forum, you can sign up back there as well. We're also pretty flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| at these, so folks probably can stand up there. Are there any announcements from Council that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| anybody wants to make before we get started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| Mr. Becker, I will not be attending the workshop we're having next Thursday. I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=184)|
| 0:03:16| suggest that Mr. Grieve chair that. We're having a workshop on the Pension Board. He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| our liaison with the Pension Board. That seemed a logical way to move, but I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| actually a decision you all can make at the meeting itself, but I wanted to leave it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| best shape I can. Any other reports from people? If not, we will, I guess, turn this over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| Ms. Rojero for a presentation on the Consolidated Five-Year Plan, and this will be on our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=218)|
| 0:03:44| Council agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| That's right. April 20th. Well, thank you all. I appreciate you being here. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| our annual workshop with Council to talk about the programs and the good things that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| doing in community development. It's also your opportunity to learn more about the Annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| Plan, the Consolidated Plan, which you'll be voting on in a couple weeks. You should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| all have a packet. What we want to do today, and we also have, as people come in to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| audience, we do have some extra packets. Our staff will hand those out. Really, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| purpose today is to provide an overview. Next slide, please. To provide an overview of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| department goals, programs, and funding sources. We want to highlight some of the events of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| the past year, and then we'll get into the specifics of reviewing the Consolidated Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| and the Annual Action Plan. We'll take questions along the way, but we want to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| have time for those before we leave. I'd like to start by introducing my staff that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| David Massey is our Neighborhood Coordinator. I think you all know most of these folks I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| going to introduce. Becky Wade is our Community Development Administrator, and she was basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| the person mostly in charge of this. If you've read this plan already, you'll realize what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| a tough job that is, so I want to recognize Becky and all the staff that supported her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| but it was primarily Becky's responsibility. We have Mark Rigsby, who is the Assistant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Community Development Administrator. Emily Woodle, who is one of our Project Specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Rogers Dowdy, our Manager for the Economic Development Section. Calvin Whitaker, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Housing Finance Supervisor. And Tim Demick, our Housing Manager. Oh, Stephanie. Everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=328)|
| 0:05:38| knows Stephanie. Stephanie is the ADA Compliance Director for the City, and she's the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| of the Disability Services. The mission of the Community Development Department is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| to revitalize low and moderate income communities, and to strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| And we do this by working with multiple partners, non-profit, government, private sector partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=362)|
| 0:06:12| and we use various sources of funding and programs to make this happen. When all is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| said and done, we have some desirable outcomes in all the work that we do. Basically, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| want to see safe, sustainable, and vibrant neighborhoods. We want decent, affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| healthy, and energy-efficient housing. We want accessible housing, and we want fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| housing. We want to see economic opportunities for individuals and businesses, and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| to see active public participation through strong neighborhood organizations. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| do all of our work and think that the community is better if we do this through very responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| and collaborative partnerships. So our office is organized into basically six main areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=411)|
| 0:06:59| We have the Office of Disability Services, as I mentioned, that Stephanie is in charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| of, the Office of Neighborhoods, the Fair Housing Office, in which we do investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| fair housing complaints, in addition to providing education on fair housing rules. That is Tara| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=428)|
| 0:07:17| Davis. The Housing Section manages all of the different housing programs that we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| be talking about, and Tim Demick is in charge of that. The Economic Development Section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| which does a lot of our blighted property acquisition, chronic problem properties, homemakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| the commercial facades, the business expansion loan programs, that's headed by Roger Stoudy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| And the Grants Administration Section is Becky's. We have something like 25 staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| members, a few are part-time, most are full-time. Now if you look at the next page, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=470)|
| 0:07:58| this big long page here, 11 by 17 page. This is really to give you an overview of the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=478)|
| 0:08:06| programs and projects and funding sources, and I'm just going to kind of go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| this, stop me, but I'm not going to deal with each one individually. You have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| a lot of these, because many of these projects, you either approve at the plan stage and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| you approve them when contracts have to be signed. So at the very top, we do get about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=501)|
| 0:08:31| a million dollars a year, more or less, in city general operating. That includes $323,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| for the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and it includes our Office of Neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| the Neighborhood Small Grants, which is typically about $30,000. Of course, we haven't seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| this year's budget yet. We also get city capital projects, which are listed there, ADA access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| blighted property, chronic problem properties, sidewalk repairs, facade improvements, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| for three years in a row, we had dollars from the city for the Park City and Phil Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| So it averages about a million a year, and this is basically the budgets. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| not balances that I'm showing you. These are the budgets until we get down to the empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=550)|
| 0:09:18| zone, and those are more of the balances and the projects right now. So those are the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| funds that we get. We then have a number of grants, mostly federal, sometimes state. Projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=562)|
| 0:09:31| from row number 9 down through 32 were projects that you approved this time last year, a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| of CDBG, HOME, and ESG. And for the new folks, if you don't understand what some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| acronyms are, please, the meeting will be twice as long if I have to say them all out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| but I will be glad to tell you what they are. So stop me if you need that. Then you go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| down to row 33 is the grant to Homeward Bound. When the Highland Avenue codes issue arose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=599)|
| 0:10:08| in Fort Sanders this year, you might remember many people were displaced because of major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| code violations, and we brought this contract to you. That was something that came as sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| of an emergency that was not part of the original plan, but fit in with the goals of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| so we were able to do that, and you all approved that $30,000. Then you move down to the ARRA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=623)|
| 0:10:29| funding. That is the stimulus money that we are involved with. Rows 34 through 37, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| are projects with the homelessness, thank you, homelessness, I know that, but it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=639)|
| 0:10:48| end of a long week for all of us, right? The Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Rehousing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Program. We then have the CDBGR program, which has some money for our facade improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| and the energy retrofits that Knox Housing Partnerships is going to do. Again, you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| approved these plans at the time. We also have the NSP1 projects. That was really the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=663)|
| 0:11:10| original HERA, the original stimulus dollars back in the summer of 2008. You can see there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| we've got Knox Housing Partnerships and Habitat, who are doing purchase of foreclosed homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| mortgage foreclosed or tax foreclosed homes. Flanagan, that you all voted for the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| night, that's funded out of this pot of money. We have some money set aside for demolitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| of blighted properties, and the Menvella Permanent Supportive Housing came from this pot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| And in all of these, you'll see there's a little bit of money for admin because it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| people to monitor these things properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Madeline, as we look at this big, long page, is there like about 10 different envelopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| that you're spending different piles of money, all of which summed up make up the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Right, we have about 11 different funding sources. Actually more than that, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=718)|
| 0:12:05| way I lump them, it turns out to be 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| Could you turn your mic on? Some people might not be able to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| The grant deadlines that are listed on the stimulus projects between line 34 and 51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| I know right now we're up against a deadline with the Empowerment Zone money, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| to, it's all reimbursed money and we have to get it spent. What do those deadlines mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| Is that when you have to spend it by or when you have to get reimbursed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| That's the deadline for spending it. The grant is over on those dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| So if you spend it on the last day, you can still turn it in and get reimbursed after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| that. I know that's kind of a technical question. Sometimes at the end of the grant, that gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| sort of sticky because you have to hurry up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Yeah, with the Empowerment Zone, June 30th is when you're supposed to spend it, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| still have another month to six weeks to draw it down. I will have to check on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| That's okay. You basically spend it by that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| I think that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I can just say, we've structured our contracts with the sub-recipients so that they end prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| to the deadline to make sure that they have time to get invoices in and that we have time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| to draw the money down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| And I actually have those contract deadlines next to the name of the project, you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| So they really, some of them were going to spend their money quicker, and so it's a shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| contract. And most of these were before you, I think just about all of them that are sub-recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| You all had to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| So when you get into NSPTHDA, that's the Eastport project that we're putting $869,000 into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| It's also the purchase of foreclosed homes in Mechanicsville, Hope 6 area, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| some infrastructure and demolition, quite a bit for demolition actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| So then when you get down to rows 52 through 61, these are some prior projects that still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| have funds in them, that we still have ongoing projects, or for one reason or another that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=840)|
| 0:14:05| project wasn't completed and we still have access to those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And as you will recall, each year, really in about a month, HUD, there's a point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=850)|
| 0:14:19| where HUD looks and there's a formula where you cannot have more than one and a half times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| your annual allocation sitting there up at the feds waiting to be drawn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| You have to have under 1.5 ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| And so we always plan for that and make sure that we come in under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| And that just shows you that HUD realizes that you can't spend all this money in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| You make a plan, you have a plan, and you implement that, you execute that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| but inevitably there are delays because of the economy, the weather, the sub-recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| There are different reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| Sometimes it's as simple as the contract language gets debated for months because we institute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=906)|
| 0:15:13| something new like insurance requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| That's happened to us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| There are some tighter insurance requirements and we've had some projects delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Well, actually a few of them haven't been executed yet, I think, maybe at least one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| So there are different reasons why projects are delayed, but HUD recognizes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| So we try to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| We want them done because certainly there's need in the community, but there are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| And this year, because we've had such a push on Empowerment Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| we've had to step back on some of the other projects in order to ensure that we met the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Empowerment Zone deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| So once we get past that, we can turn our attention back to some of the owner-occupied rehabs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| that are funded out-of-home or CDBG and other kinds of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| About the HOPE VI and mechanics bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Is that still an ongoing project with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| Is it not completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| You mean is HOPE VI ongoing or is it the purchase of foreclosed homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Well, I'm just looking at the dates here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| You have 3-19-13 and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| For HOPE VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| That includes more than just the mechanics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| This is a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| You know, they've completed the HOPE VI project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Really what this means is that there are homes in Mechanicsville Commons area that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=989)|
| 0:16:35| foreclosed upon due to people not being able to pay their mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| And so their proposal in this plan was to have some money to buy those foreclosed homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| put some money into repairing them, and then get them back on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| That's what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| And they have until March of 2013 to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| And was the intent there to keep those homes from going into a landlord situation to try to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| owner-occupied or just to try to keep more control of the housing stock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| That's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| And, you know, plus when a home is vacant, then that's going to hurt everybody in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| So it was to keep the homes occupied and to try and keep home ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| though they can rent them if they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| But the idea is home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| A number of the – all the people who bought homes in the HOPE VI area while the project was going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| were low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| They did have jobs and they did have mortgages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| But just like everyone else in the country, it was affected by the mortgage crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| So a number of those families went into foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| So when the ARRA money came along, we designated so much for that project so that they could purchase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1074)|
| 0:18:03| homes and then resell them again to low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| Now, we're not sure that this full project will go forward, though, because there are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| apparently some of those homes that were originally available were purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| And so whether, in fact, KCDC can implement this whole project as originally conceived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| you know, we're in conversation with them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| It is possible that we might come back with a revision to that contract, but we don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| So then you get down row 62 through 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| This is program income that comes in month after month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| and it's based on previous rehab loans that were made either through the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| which was a state program, or HOPE III, which was a federal program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| And so sometimes, like with 62 and 63 there, we'll actually take a chunk of that program income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1136)|
| 0:19:03| and allocate it to a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Row 64 is sort of a contingency fund, miscellaneous fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Sometimes we have projects in the housing section that just – there's something that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| but it just doesn't fit the CDBG or the house – or the home rules, and we can use house money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| And so it's a good fund for us to have when we kind of get in a bind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| because every one of these programs has their own rules, their own regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| their own reporting requirements, and it's a big maze that you have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| crawl through to figure out how to get some worthwhile projects done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And then finally, rows 67 to 78, those are the – yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| What is the income on that bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| That one, that is not income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| We're spending that income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| We allocated $100,000 of program income from house to the MinnVilla project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| Yes, so the money comes in, and this is how we spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And so the empowerment zone projects, all of these are under contract and are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1214)|
| 0:20:23| We've talked about these before, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| We're down to several – some big chunks of money related to construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| but they are working very diligently every day on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| Everybody should be praying for sunny weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| I want to recognize Roger's daddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| He's just been unbelievable and jumping through hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| You all approved that one – those emergency amendments for Vestal the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| That's to keep these projects going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| You know, one issue has been the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| that where we needed private sector investment on a lot of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| it was very hard to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| There were a lot of delays because it was hard to get financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| and there's just the instability and kind of concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| But we've got things moving, and it's our intention to spend every penny of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| The other challenge in spending that is that we continue to get program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| The Blighted Properties Redevelopment Program, which is the second from the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| as people get a loan, they develop the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| and then they turn around and either get their long-term financing or they sell the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| then all of a sudden we've got $104,000 or $250,000 that we have to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1291)|
| 0:21:37| before we can draw any more down from the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| And so it's great that we're getting – that people are paying us back like they're supposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| but it makes it harder for us to then get every penny out of the Treasury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| which is what we're trying to do because it is allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| You know, it's money that came from the citizens at some point and headed up to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| and we're trying to get it back to make sure that we can reinvest it in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| The final four rows that I have in green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| all of those projects will continue after the Empowerment Zone ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| because all of those are revolving loan funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| And so I don't have a projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| That's the next thing we need to do is sit down and figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| But the Business Expansion Loan Program, the Small Business Loan Program that the Urban League implements for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| manages for us, the Blighted Property Redevelopment, and the Minor Home Repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| all of those are generating program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| So those programs can continue at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| It won't be the same levels before because the income comes in over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| But they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| You're not fiscal year bound is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Correct, they are not bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| They kind of roll back in and you reinvest them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Right, and we'll keep reinvesting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| Okay, so just to keep us moving because we've got a lot of stuff here to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| That's kind of the big picture of the different things that we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| And those of you that went on the tour with us, you've got a sense of that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| as you saw the variety of projects all across town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| Okay, so we wanted to mention some of the highlights of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| First of all, we got an excellent review from HUD when we submitted our CAPER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| that's our Consolidated Annual Performance Evaluation Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1396)|
| 0:23:23| And I think we did share that with you all when we got that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| We began implementation of the stimulus projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Our office said the last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| and a half has just kind of been in a whirl between trying to finish off with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| the Empowerment Zone and then get out plans that could be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| and implemented for the stimulus project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| So new $5.8 million came in over the last fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| As you saw on the previous page, we have either implemented ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| or we have sub-recipients whom we must monitor for over 80 projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| which translates into literally hundreds of individual activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| which we have to document every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Every house that's rehabbed, every loan that's out there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| everything that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| These projects have all of these sub-projects underneath them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| And so there are hundreds of individual activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| And so that's part of what we spend our day and night doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| We already talked about the Empowerment Zone, that it's coming to a close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| This year we also launched the Vacant Properties Campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| and had the Genesee Institute from Flint, Michigan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| come in and do an analysis of our current laws as they relate to tax foreclosures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| and land banking authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| These are two of many tools in the Community Development Toolbox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| that communities use in order to address vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| And we are continuing that initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| And, by the way, there's a group of UT students in the MBA program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| that are working with us right now to identify what happens to those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| that do sell a tax foreclosure because our hypothesis, what we believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| what we know generally happens is that if you buy a property in tax foreclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| it's probably not going to get redeveloped anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| because you don't get a clear title and you can't get title insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| and, therefore, you can't get a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| But the way the laws are set up, there's sort of this trap that we fall into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| because of the way the laws are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| So we're looking at how other communities have changed their statewide legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| and we're also looking at things we can do locally working together with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| trustee, our tax office, and Chancery Court to try and improve the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| to hopefully improve our chances of getting clear title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| So we're approaching it a couple different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| That's a big, long story we probably don't have time to get into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| but we've launched that whole initiative and we'll continue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| We've continued our focus and commitment to visitable, healthy, sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| and energy-efficient development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| That's really been one of our mantras in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Both Eastport and Flinican will be LEED-certified buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| which means not only will they be developed in an energy-efficient way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| but they will go even further in terms of seeking sustainable development practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| And we've talked about that in some of our other presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| Yes, I believe they're all visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| There will be visitable features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| We made the Federal Fair Housing Accessibility Guidelines, Section 504, accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| I think some units are more accessible than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| All of our replacement homes that we're going to be building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| we're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| We're going to be building in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| All of our replacement homes that we oversee the construction of are required to be ENERGY STAR certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1643)|
| 0:27:32| which is a third-party certification that it meets certain energy efficiency standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Our CHOTOs, our nonprofit housing partners, all of their new construction is ENERGY STAR and they're visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1656)|
| 0:27:48| I already mentioned the CDBGR energy retrofits that Knox Housing Partnership is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Not only will they be retrofitting existing homes in the Park City neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| but they're going to be using young interns who will be learning basically green techs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| they're calling them, who will learn some of these skills in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| We expect to implement soon the EarthCraft certification, which is something that came out of South Face in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1690)|
| 0:28:20| It's, again, a third-party certification, and this is for renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| ENERGY STAR is more for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Our staff is certified, our housing staff is certified as healthy home specialists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1707)|
| 0:28:34| which means that they are experts in how you design a home and construct it so that there's good indoor air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| you address mold issues, water issues and such, radon and the rest of those things that make a home actually unhealthy inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1722)|
| 0:28:51| So we're really focusing on that and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| We work very closely with our Neighborhood Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| We actually expanded membership on there and have brought in some more likewise excellent members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1738)|
| 0:29:06| and their role is really expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| They're starting to take on some of the tough issues that will be or have been to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| and so we're happy for that role with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| When I mentioned all of the many, many activities, the sub-activities to these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| every rehab, every My Front Yard, every birth loan, we have to track all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| and for years it was done in a customized access database because the city's financial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1770)|
| 0:29:39| the Oracle financial system did not have the capacity, was not designed to be able to track that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1779)|
| 0:29:45| Diana Libertini, who many of you know, she designed that basically over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| And so we have worked, it literally took a year with finance information systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and our team meeting basically weekly to customize the Oracle financial system to be able to track all of this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| so that we didn't have to enter the same information two times, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| because really the only official books are the city books and not our access database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| So that's been a significant achievement, and we appreciate finance and information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| And, of course, the other big thing we did was develop this five-year consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| and that's what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Madeline, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| On the third-party reviews of the different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| whether it's sustainability or your, what did you call it, the gold star?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Lead gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Have you done a comparison in terms of what those costs are in terms of added to the cost of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| and what the payback is on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| I'm going to defer that question to Tim Demick, our housing manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| Can you address that, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Tim, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| Maybe come up to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| Yeah, and while you're coming up, we had a comment from the CTV folks that they can't hear most of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| so I'm going to insist that everybody turn your mic on and lean forward and speak clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| It's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| It's something I think we need to do a more formal analysis of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| We're certainly cognizant of the cost of going green and that there is a break-even point in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| So I think we are doing it informally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Some numbers I'll throw out at you in terms of the Energy Star certification on our new homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| we estimate that cost is about $2,000 extra per home, and we're seeing a 30% decrease in utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| So that's a pretty good payback period for the Energy Star certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| On the LEED projects, that is a more expensive certification process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| but we've worked with the developers to identify sort of the best certification route at the lowest cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| and we haven't gotten one of those done yet, so we don't have any data yet on the savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| But we're certainly aware of not wanting to put a burden on the project and to see a return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| A nice synergy on the rental projects that are going LEED at Eastport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| and Flinnegan is the owners pay the utility bills in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| so they're going to be able to recapture some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| A lot of times the developer doesn't actually pay the utility bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| and so it's not easy to get the incentive aligned as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| So it's a great question and a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| I think as we do more, we need to probably do a more formal take on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| In general, the costs so far have been minimal and the paybacks have been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| I know we're looking at that on several of the university projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| and the university had made the decision instead of actually going to LEED certified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| the state of Tennessee developed their own sustainability guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| and I don't know if you folks are aware of those in terms of they're a lot of the same items are on the state's list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| but it's not as detailed as what LEED is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| If you haven't seen those, it might be a good idea to take a look at those two just for a comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and then be able to really see what your payback is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| I think we're still very much in a learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| This is something that across the country, across the world, really looking at how do we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| and there are a lot of other approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| and so what we want to be is be on the front end exploring these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| and frankly, you've got to test some out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| You've got to be willing to test it out and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| That's what the state's doing also, so they're developing their own sustainability guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| To me, this is important regardless of whether the developer gets it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| because we've got low-income families that are now going to be able to be in a rental unit or another unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| and actually be able to afford staying there, and it's that ongoing cost that really is the killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| Right, and we've always said that a house is not affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Your rent may be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Your mortgage may be affordable, but if your electric or gas bill isn't, then it's not an affordable house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| so we've not really helped them by putting them in a house with a high utility bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| Okay, I'm going to turn this over right now to Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| She's going to start talking to you about the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I do want to say this, that if you struggle to read that, first of all, we want to say this is not our idea of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| This is a required plan, a required format that is tedious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| You have to kind of struggle through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Sometimes the same question seems like it's asked four or five different times in different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| but if you can struggle with that and get to the end and see what it is that we're going to be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| and what we're proposing, then I think you'll get excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| We're excited about it, but you just have to kind of delve through the report to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Okay, like Madeline said, the consolidated plan is a HUD plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| This is required by Housing and Urban Development for cities to submit every three years or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| We choose to submit it every five years so that we can receive our entitlement funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| We could actually have meetings like this more often if we chose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| We would not recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| We wouldn't recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| So this plan covers a time period from July 1st, 2010 of this year through June 30th of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2128)|
| 0:35:38| Additionally, we had to do an annual plan, which is included in your binder there, for just the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| That's July 1st, 2010 through June 30th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| So we had to do the same thing we do every year plus a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| For the first time, we combined with the county to do a lot of our information gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| and consultation with service providers and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| So I think it worked out very well for us to have the county with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| We were able to get a lot more participation from agencies and individuals when we did all our data gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| They're required to do the exact same plan for their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| The consolidated plan is a community needs study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| It's how you structure your priorities within the federal priorities, which are decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2194)|
| 0:36:43| suitable living environments, and economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| Those are the areas that our federal funds can be targeted towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| Within those, you come up with your local priorities based on community needs, the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| and the input from citizens and service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2219)|
| 0:37:06| The plan addresses how we, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| will implement the priorities that we've addressed in this plan over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| And then in the annual plan portion is where you get into exactly what projects will be funded each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| to meet those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| Our planning began with a series of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| They were meetings, like I said, we joined with the county and we invited agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| and community leaders that serve low to moderate income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| We held those meetings all one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| It was November 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| They were held all day long, and we broke that down to four focus group areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2269)|
| 0:37:56| We had a housing and economic development group, homeless service providers group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| education and job service group, and a health and special needs group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| We had 29 organizations participating and about 70 people came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| In addition to taking down all their comments and writing those up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| we provided them with surveys and got back their documentation on what they felt like their needs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| in order to assist them in helping to serve their population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| We also had interdepartmental meetings with city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| and with agencies that work very closely with us, like KCDC, CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| some of the agencies that we work with on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| We had 24 attend our interdepartmental meeting, intergovernmental meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2327)|
| 0:38:57| We also had a youth input meeting at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| David Massey went and met with a government class and got their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| and that's also included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Our first public meeting was held December 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| That was held, you know, widely advertised, open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| We passed out surveys at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| We also sent surveys out through the neighborhood's newsletter, through a variety of sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| and we got back approximately 80 surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Our next public meeting is next Tuesday evening at 530 at the Canceler Y,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| and at that time we will take public comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| All those comments will be included in the final plan that you will approve, hopefully, on April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2391)|
| 0:40:00| We will pass those out to you that night so you can see the public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| Okay, like I said, in addition to getting information from agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| and the public about what they see the needs are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| we have to evaluate data based on what HUD provides us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and this is data based on housing needs primarily of lower income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| As expected, the greatest need is for the very lowest income population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| Thirty percent or below of area median income, that's $17,650 for a family of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| shows a very high need for renters and homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| Very low income, that first category, I'm sorry, is called extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2447)|
| 0:40:54| That's a HUD definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Very low is between 31% AMI and 50% AMI, and that amount is $29,400 for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2456)|
| 0:41:09| Once again, we show very high needs in those areas as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| and for low income families, that's a family of four, $47,050,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| there still are needs primarily in the homeownership category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| And by housing need, what that means, it's spelled out in your binder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| but that's where somebody pays over 30% of their income for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| or they are in an overcrowded situation or they lack indoor plumbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| or full kitchen facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| So that is a HUD definition of housing needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| and that information is provided to us via their housing website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2507)|
| 0:41:57| We also evaluated the housing stock, and interestingly, citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2517)|
| 0:42:06| 67% of the housing was built before 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Well, that's a trigger for us because that's when lead paint stopped being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| Houses built prior to that are very likely to have lead paint in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| If we do any kind of rehabilitation on a house, we do have to test it for lead paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| We have to make sure that there isn't any or we have to abate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| For a full rehab, it has to be abated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| So, you know, it's very likely that most housing rehabs we get into require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| lead abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| I'm going to talk about the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| I'm confused about that because I saw that section in the booklet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| and I keep thinking, how many people are eating their walls or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| I mean, if you're not a contractor grinding it up and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| this stuff's buried under ten layers of paint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| What's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| But I realize there are regs that EPA puts out and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| but it's kind of like madness to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Well, you know, Tim may want to comment about this some more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| but there are HUD federal requirements that if you spend over $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| on any kind of project on a home, you have to test it for lead if it is older than 1978.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2598)|
| 0:43:28| Just briefly, it is a significant problem, particularly with younger children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| It's a neurotoxin, and the issue is the dust that's created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| And a lot of times with the older windows, anytime you have paint chips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| or peeling paint, once they become airborne,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| you can actually find lead children that have lead poisoning through screenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| The health department has some data on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| So I agree, in certain circumstances it does seem like overkill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| but a lot of our funding, there's some grant funding we have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| that's particularly tied to households with young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| That's really where it's worth doing the lead abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| It can be a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Do you have to get contractors that are certified and spend extra money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| In other words, I picture the asbestos days when they go in with the spacesuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| and, you know, if you leave that stuff alone, it doesn't get airborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| But that's part of the requirements that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| We have to use state-certified lead contractors on the lead work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| And that does increase the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| But if we're doing work on a house that has lead paint in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| we're going to want contractors who know how to deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| because we can kill workers if we don't do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| Workers can be poisoned too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| When you're removing the paint, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| As many of you may know, for the past ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| we've had an empowerment zone designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| and the empowerment zone has served as basically our target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| It's a neighborhood revitalization strategy area as far as HUD's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| And so we have focused our resources in the empowerment zone primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| for the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| Since that designation has gone away, we are no longer required to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| But in evaluating all the data that we had about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| and income levels and needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| we found that there were some target areas within the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| that we wanted to focus our resources on in a strategic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| And there's a number of reasons why we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| And I'll go through the target areas first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| Can everybody see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| You may see it better in your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Target area one is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2752)|
| 0:46:00| The census tracks are actually on the next map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| but we'll get into that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Target area two is Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, and Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| Target area three is Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| And then across Broadway, I'm not sure exactly what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| but it's Cecil, Chicago Avenue kind of area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| That's all one target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| And then target area four is South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| includes the South Waterfront Development and Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| And I'm going to go through some reasons why we chose those as our target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| First of all, this is the income map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| And if you can see that, the darkest red area in the center there of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2804)|
| 0:46:51| shows that 80% of the households have incomes at less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| or equal to 80% AMI, which is the population we're required to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| So as you see right off the bat, that dark red area has the lowest income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| The next darker or lighter, I should say, orange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| at slightly over 60% up to 80% of the households are at or below 80% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| The sort of mustard yellow is 40.1% to 60%, 80% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| And then the bright yellow is 20% to 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| So our target areas are overlaid on that, and they're cross-hatched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| And so you can see that within all of our target areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| we are serving low-income neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| What is the base rate that you use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| We have to serve families at 80% or below, 80% AMI or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| And what is AMI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Area Median Income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| And what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| It's $47,050 for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| So it changes based on your family size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2894)|
| 0:48:21| This is just zooming in a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| You can see the census tracts are on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| So you can see where the east one includes 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2907)|
| 0:48:37| Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, Beaumont is 12, 13, 14, and 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| Oakwood-Lincoln Park in that other area is 15, 17, and 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| And the south Knoxville target area is 8 and 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| Let me ask you a question about that family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| For one, for a single, you know, elderly person or an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| what would that figure be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| I didn't bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| One person household at 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| I know a lot of elderly people who live alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Would be in this target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| That number for one household individual is $32,750.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2962)|
| 0:49:27| That's 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Most of the families we serve are far below that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| We are allowed to go up to 80%, but most of the families we serve are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| in the very low income bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| This next map shows the NSP2 target area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| You might remember that we applied for an NSP2 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| That was the Neighborhood Stabilization Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| This area was derived from data provided on the number of high-cost mortgages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| and potential vacant properties within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| So, as you can see, this map, it's not 100%, but it overlays quite well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| over our target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| You're just saying that this verifies that your target areas are the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| target areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Those areas that are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| What's NSP2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Just help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| It's Neighborhood Stabilization Program 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| It was the second round of funding that came out with the ARRA money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| We applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| We were not successful in getting a grant, but it was more Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Stabilization money to deal with foreclosed, abandoned, and vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3041)|
| 0:50:48| And we're essentially looking at old center city, whether that's north, south?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| Yes, without some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| As you can note, downtown is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| 4th and Gill is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| Those are neighborhoods that really don't need our assistance anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| There's enough private investment in downtown, in 4th and Gill, in parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Old North Knoxville that, although we could possibly do some sort of project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| it's not an area that needs a lot of our funding at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| And your goal is to have no black lines on this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Well, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| Right, and we want to be clear with the target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| We are not saying that these are the only areas in which we will work, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| there are several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| We're analyzing right now which programs will be most effective in targeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| So even with 4th and Gill, if there's a particular chronic problem property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| that otherwise is not, you know, the economics are such that it's just not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| going to happen with the market, then because there is so much strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| investment there, we can make a move like with Luttrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| You know, with the council's approval, we were able to acquire Luttrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| and now that's turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| It actually closed, I think, Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| And so that purchaser, the woman who bought that, will start rehabbing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| and will move in it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| So we want it clear that this doesn't mean that we will not work in any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| area, but we're going to be targeting some of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| And if you're in that area, you might get a higher priority, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| for owner-occupied rehab or a My Front Yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| But we may even drill down more and say within a particular, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| within Oakwood-Lincoln Park, there may even be some parts of Oakwood-Lincoln| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| Park because we've got some chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| A Chodo might be doing some infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Then we might say, okay, we're going to do some My Front Yards right around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| there so that those investments that are occurring can be supported by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| more investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| So we just want that to be clear so you don't get calls from everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| saying they'll never do anything in their neighborhood for five more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3178)|
| 0:52:59| But the idea you just described then helps stabilize that area and is kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| of an example to the next block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| This next map doesn't show up at all up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| You may be able to see it better in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| This is one of the maps that was developed for the Vacant Properties Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3194)|
| 0:53:20| And it shows several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| It shows – is this the text?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| No, this is the nuisance structures, nuisance lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| I got the wrong one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| You got the wrong one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| This is a map of nuisance properties, vacant lots, blighted structures based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3217)|
| 0:53:46| on codes data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| And as you can see, it kind of overlays right into the target areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| we've designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3234)|
| 0:54:03| The next page shows the tax foreclosed properties in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| These are properties that have been to tax sales and sold and then properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| that are delinquent three or more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Once again, you can see the overlay with the target areas that we've chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| It also includes properties that didn't sell but are now in the hands of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| city and the county, which are 60% of those that go to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| How many parcels do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Do you remember that number, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| We may have to get back with you on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Under the ADA, are you required to make this print readable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Only if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| And you have to request it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| How many days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| 48 hours notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| Yeah, we apologize for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| But we could get you all five by eight maps if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Wrap your walls on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| And the final map, once again, shows our target areas with our redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3303)|
| 0:55:12| areas superimposed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| That's just because another reason for us choosing these areas was to build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| existing investment and the work that's ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Just because this is a new five-year plan doesn't mean we're going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| doing what we're currently doing in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| We're going to continue working and finishing the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| the redevelopment plans that exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| So all of our target areas encompass the current neighborhood redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| and other redevelopment areas that the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| If you want to turn over to your next page, page 12, you will see, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3356)|
| 0:56:05| you know, boiling down all this data, we have to get to some local priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| goals and priorities within the HUD federal priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| So there's a table there that shows within the decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| create suitable living environment, and create economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| we've identified five priorities of where we're going to focus our funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| The first one is home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| This is something we've been doing for a long time and we will continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| It's to increase the supply of affordable owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| improve the quality and energy efficiency of owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| improve access to fair and affordable owner-occupied housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| and increase the supply of visitable owner-occupied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| Within rental housing, we will increase the supply of affordable rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| improve the quality and energy efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| improve access to fair and affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| and increase the supply of visitable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Under homelessness, we will increase the supply of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| improve access to permanent supportive housing for persons who are homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| and provide supportive services for persons who are homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| or at risk of becoming homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Under neighborhood stabilization, and that's under the next category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| that's creating a suitable living environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Before you leave, when you say access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| is that the physical access things we talked about, the one or no steps, the 32-inch door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| It's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| We will improve access through a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| It can be through case management to get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| It can be financial assistance to get into housing in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| This does not necessarily refer to accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| Let me ask you about the rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| You work with individual houses as well as apartment complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3491)|
| 0:58:17| on energy efficiency and all of that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| We, from time to time, do rental rehab programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| We work with, say, an owner of rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Typically, there are people that aren't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| but they will rehab the housing with our funds through a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| and then pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Of course, we would require that they do ENERGY STAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| or some sort of LEED for homes, Earthcraft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3526)|
| 0:58:55| Under neighborhood stabilization, we will mitigate the impact of vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| blighted, and foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| eliminate environmental hazards that impede redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| improve the safety and livability of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| through redevelopment revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| strengthen neighborhoods by increasing the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| of resident stakeholder-led organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| support quality facilities and services available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| As you can see, that's a medium priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Over the last several years, our funds have been depleting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| our federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| and we haven't been able to support facility improvements as in years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| So if money was available, we would participate in that type of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Promote the development of mixed-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| improve mobility and access to transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| That's through sidewalks or bus shelters, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| Under creating economic opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| increase access to economic opportunities for businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| in low-mod income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| That would be our facade program as a prime example of one of the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3603)|
| 1:00:08| that would fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Increase access to economic opportunities for low-mod income persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| and remediate and redevelop brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Any questions about our local goals and our objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| What is that number two, the access to economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| for the lower-moderate income folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| You gave an example of the business one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| It would be a job training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| For example, we've funded a couple of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| through the Empowerment Zone over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| So is that that green training you're giving to some young people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Is that part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| It's an example of that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Okay, so given these goals, again, remember that these are five-year goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| and we have to come up with goals and priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| and strategies before we even know how much money might be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| And so you put out what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| One thing that does help, even though, and we told folks who came to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| planning sessions, listing sessions for this consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| we want to get all the needs here and what we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| And then as money comes in, you prioritize and figure out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| weighing a number of different factors, which we'll get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| But this is the big goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| And within that, there are a number of ways we can actually make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| and that's page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| These are potential projects, depending on the amount of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| Madeline, before you get there, we'll get back to economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| The third one, I'm wondering, redevelops brownfields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Are we working with Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| or someone in the Chamber to be helping in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| Are we relying only on our own programs in the Community Development Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| We work with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| You know, we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| I meet every two weeks with the Mayor and the Chamber and KCDC, and we review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Because they obviously have some access to tools to help with the brownfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Okay, so you are coordinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| So for the housing programs, the CHODO, our Community Housing Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| Organizations, the nonprofit partners, they would fall under this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| The owner-occupied rehabilitation that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| down payment assistance for homeownership opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| education and counseling for homeowners or potential homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| emergency home repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| We've done that for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| We have some partners that we'll see in a minute that do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| The My Front Yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| that is the residential version of the Commercial Facade Program, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| It's up to $5,000 and a five-year deferrable loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| which basically means you can have that forgiven over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| And we've seen some wonderful changes, exterior changes to homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| The homes have to meet some basic minimum housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| You know, if it's falling apart inside, we won't put a nice shiny outside on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| But for many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| that amount of investment has made a huge difference for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| and their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| The Ramps and Rails DRC, Disability Resource Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3799)|
| 1:03:25| they provide ramps and rails for persons with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| Rental rehab we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| Permanent supportive housing we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| And fair housing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| Those types of activities would fall under these housing goals and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| Under the Neighborhood Stabilization Strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| the Blighted Property Redevelopment Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| that has been funded by the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| and I mentioned would now have program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| We could continue that, maybe eventually putting some CDBG dollars into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| Blighted Property Acquisition, this is something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| We acquire both residential and commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| to mitigate the negative impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| And most of those have to come to you all for your approval, many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| Homeless services, again, that's key to stabilizing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| There are other blighted property programs that we have looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| such as community gardens, artistic board up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| which is a better way of boarding up houses that are vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| so they don't look so bad and have such a negative impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Environmental cleanup is a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Many years gone by, when houses were demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| they were pushed into the basement and covered up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| And now, in order to redevelop those properties, you have to dig that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| And so we know of several situations where that has been a serious cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3887)|
| 1:04:55| and inability to reinvest on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Neighborhood capacity building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| we've talked about that with our Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| That's key to stabilizing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Technical assistance to nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| this is something we've done for several years with the East Tennessee Community Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| and David Watson is here with us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| where he works directly with nonprofits and agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| and with us, really, on the facade and other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| to build capacity of nonprofits and to provide resources through his volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| that they might otherwise not have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| Public improvements, Becky mentioned this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| this is something we'd like to be able to do again if we had more money coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| but it's not one of our highest priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| as well as the public facility improvements and the services to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| That might be like senior care, youth care, youth development, important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| but we would have to have more dollars coming in before we could be able to invest in that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| We mentioned some of these economic development programs, the facades, the development loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| which could be the business expansion loan or the small business loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| that will continue on both originally EZ programs, and we've talked about those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3964)|
| 1:06:12| Okay, so moving along, cognizant of the time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| I wanted to ask you about the Fair Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Do you get very many complaints of housing discrimination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| Do you have a person on your staff that works on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| We have two trained Fair Housing Assistance Program investigators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| one full-time investigates Fair Housing complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| We average nine to 12 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| They're not all cause cases, but they have to be fully investigated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| and either they're conciliated or they may find a cause or they may be a no-cause case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4006)|
| 1:06:55| But, yeah, we have a full-time staff that that's all they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| And then Stephanie Cook works some on cases as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| She'll take cases if we get too many in at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| Okay, so that basically is, in a nutshell, the five-year consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| with a lot of other detail that I'm sure you have enjoyed reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| And I wanted to just say, if you have any questions when you get in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| don't hesitate to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| I'll be glad to try to do my best to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| I was wondering if you had the eight-page summary that had all that information compiled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| in the 135 in the first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| This is your summary, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Read the executive summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| Yeah, Emily just noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Emily worked a lot on this as well, helping with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| The strategic plan section really does kind of lay out what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| So that may be a place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Okay, so now that we have the five-year consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| we also have to prepare our annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And this says how we're going to spend the money that HUD just told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| They just told us exactly how much we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| So we actually developed our action plan based on what we thought we were going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| And so what we're going to talk about in a minute is a little bit of a revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| from what we posted a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| But this is how we spend just three of those 11 sources of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| Remember, we have 11 or more sources of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| CDBG, home, and emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| So in deciding how we use those, in addition to the data that we saw in these target areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| we also have to look back at our consolidated plan priorities and the HUD regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| which can be quite complex at times depending on the source of fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| We look at the mayor's priorities because as the community development department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| we work very closely in support of mayor's priorities and other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| We want to work collaboratively and leverage the resources of other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| We work closely with Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| We might put, like with Union Square Park, we put some money in 50,000 CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| They put some city dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| And we try to leverage our dollars that way and with other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| We try to be proactive as opposed to reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| That's why we are really exploring the energy efficiency, the visitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| We want to be out on the front in making the positive change happen that we think is needed in order to be a sustainable community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4176)|
| 1:09:45| And, again, we try to also be progressive in future thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| Part of the whole Genesee Land Institute recommendations is about thinking in new ways how we can address existing problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4189)|
| 1:09:57| So, in order to determine what we're going to do with our annual action plan or how we're going to spend that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| we need to know how much money we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| And I'm sorry, I hope your eyes are better than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| I thought this looked better on my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| But for CDBG, we are actually getting about 8 percent, I really cannot read this, 8 percent more than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4212)|
| 1:10:23| yeah, can you read it, Betty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| You have your glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Our HUD allocation of CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| Becky's actually older than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| By a mere few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| And Madeline points that out every chance she gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Only for a few months is she older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Yeah, our CDBG allocation is $2,032,567.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| When we did this draft plan, we estimated it at a little more than that, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| So, of course, we had to adjust all our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| That amount is an 8.1 percent increase over our last year's allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4265)|
| 1:11:17| Congress appropriating that much money to CDBG and then it getting divided up nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| There's a formula, which nobody can really explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| It's a complex formula on how it gets divided up among entitlement communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| We're considered an entitlement community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| We are anticipating $100,000 to reprogram from prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| Those are for projects that did not spend all the money that we had allocated to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| or didn't get started and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| But we have to carry that over from one year to the next and reprogram it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| So that's that next line, $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| We are estimating program income to be $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| And Madeline talked about our program income a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| That comes in from our owner-occupied rehabs that are funded with CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| When people make their payments, we get program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| So that has to be rolled into what we have to allocate to projects every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| Also, when we sell properties like Luttrell, we purchased it with CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| When we sell it, that becomes program income that we can then reallocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| So our total CDBG for the coming year is $2,262,567.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| And that's a 14.3% increase over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4353)|
| 1:12:39| As far as home money goes, we are actually receiving $1.391,991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4359)|
| 1:12:47| And that's a 0.5% decrease over last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| We are reprogramming $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| And we're estimating our program income to be $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| So for home, to spend on the coming year's projects, we have $2,241,991,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4381)|
| 1:13:08| which is a 0.5% decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4388)|
| 1:13:16| In emergency shelter grants, once again, it's gone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| We are receiving $82,579, which is a 0.2% decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4400)|
| 1:13:28| So our total allocation of funds for these sources of funds for the coming year is $4,587,137.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4408)|
| 1:13:38| And that amounts to a 6.4% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4418)|
| 1:13:47| Yes, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4427)|
| 1:13:53| It's been going down basically every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| It's either close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| It's not gone down significantly, but it's going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| Now, we don't know what will happen this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| There's talk about what's going to happen with this budget, but we don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| That would be for July of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4449)|
| 1:14:13| Congress appropriates for the October 1 start of the federal fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| but that budget then starts us in July of the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| It's a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| Okay, so if you actually skip the next page and go to the last page on page 16, which is an Excel spreadsheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| this is where the rubber meets the road in terms of how we're going to spend those dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| what we are proposing and seeking your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| First of all, under CDBG, the Community Development Block Grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| based on those priorities that we've outlined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| based on the programs that we have been working with and that we think will effectively meet those needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| we're proposing that we put $250,000 into the Commercial Facade Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| I think a lot of you know the difference that has made at Broadway and Central, up Central,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| certainly Happy Holler and all the way up, Magpies, Colorama Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| all the buildings straight up Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Also, Magnolia, we've got several properties that are having facades there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| We've got some in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| We consider that we've put about $3 million into facades between city dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4526)|
| 1:15:34| CDBG dollars, and mostly the Empowerment Zone dollars, a couple million of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| Those funds are going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Is there a per building limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Each building, there's a maximum of $50,000, but it's based on square footage, so it might be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| Also, 20% of the cost has to be contributed by the building owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4551)|
| 1:15:59| and it's a five-year forgivable loan if you meet certain conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| So last year, because we allocated dollars through, we used CDBGR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4563)|
| 1:16:12| You remember on that first spreadsheet I showed you, CDBGR is funding facades at $150,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| so we actually didn't have it in our annual plan last year because we were funding it another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| but we want to put that back in because the Empowerment Zone funds will be gone, so recommending $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| Blighted property acquisition, it's a key strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| Because of the dollars that we have this year, we are lowering that amount because we still have some from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4596)|
| 1:16:45| and some from the city funds that are all targeted for properties and moving forward, but there is a time lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| It takes a while to get this done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| and so we were comfortable that we could keep that program going with fewer dollars this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| And one reason why we've got the money left is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| we've been focusing on Empowerment Zone and getting those dollars spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| Number three, the Community and Economic Development Projects, that is a contingency fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| If something goes over or something pops up unexpectedly that needs a little bit of money that can make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| that's why we put a little bit of money in there each year, and that's a little more than $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| Our owner-occupied housing rehab, we're recommending $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| You'll see that we put over a million in it down with the home dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| so a lot of our owner-occupied rehab is through the home funds rather than the CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| We want to, again, put $100,000 in rental rehab, housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4662)|
| 1:17:49| Number six, the My Front Yard that I mentioned earlier, the exterior facade improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| that was all funded with Empowerment Zone, and by the time that's finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| we think we'll have probably close to 200 of those completed throughout the Empowerment Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| We think it's an effective targeted program, and so we're recommending $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| That would be 20, is that my math right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| About 20 projects might make a difference in some targeted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Housing activities delivery, this is basically the staffing that is required to do all of the housing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| There's not a cap for that like some admin costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| because this is staff time that is required to actually do programs as opposed to planning and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| So we're recommending $450,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| The CDBG admin is the non-housing admin that's like developing the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| having public meetings, monitoring sub-recipients, all that kind of work, a lot of what Becky's team does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| We are recommending $432,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| That's within that cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Number nine is rental rehabilitation for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| Every year, for several years, we have allocated funds to be in support of the 10-year planned in chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4751)|
| 1:19:20| and this would be the CDBG dollars for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Number 10 is emergency home repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| CAC is our partner in that project, and we're recommending another $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| I can tell you that the demand is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| We could put $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| We could put a million dollars into that, and we wouldn't meet the need in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| I think they've already spent all their money for this year, and the fiscal year doesn't end until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| Just like houses that have leaky roofs or problems with windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| Is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Typically, it's major systems that need repair, whether it's heat, air, electric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4798)|
| 1:20:04| plumbing, roof, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| So you're keeping them from going uninhabitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| Keeping a decent home, affordable home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Many of these are elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Mr. Brown, you talked about elderly folks in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| A lot of folks are elderly or are persons with disabilities who don't have the resources to make these repairs on their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4822)|
| 1:20:31| Okay, number 11, minor home repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| This is our partner, and this project is neighborhood housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| They actually leverage a lot of volunteer help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| This is their operation backyard project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| It's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| It's usually in the spring and summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| So we're recommending $70,000 to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| The Rance and Rails program from Disability Resource Center, that is doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| We've had about $12,000, I think, the last two years, and there's a great demand by people who need rails and ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4857)|
| 1:21:05| It might be a person with a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| It might be a senior person who can no longer climb the steps up to the porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| So we're asking for $20,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Here's the Design Center, number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| They're our partner in providing the technical assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| We'd like to renew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| This year at $60,000, that's an amount, it's less than last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| but Mr. Watson believes that that's a sufficient amount of money for them to continue what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| And number 14 is the Homeless Management Information System, the HMIS, which you all heard a lot about the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| This is the way to track individuals in the homeless service system in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| And we routinely contribute towards that, which is $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| Oh, no, it's greater than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| I don't know the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| I know the county contributes $10,000 as well to HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| Okay, so those are the CDBG funds and how we are proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| You see what they received last year and what we're proposing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| The home dollars, these are dollars targeted specifically for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4937)|
| 1:22:22| Where CDBG has a little more flexibility, there are more eligible uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| Home is more restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| And the rules are totally different, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| Number 15 is recommending over $1 million for owner-occupied housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| Remember, these are low-interest loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| They get paid back, and we're able to continue with that program income to support other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4960)|
| 1:22:50| That's some of that $350,000 that we're anticipating as program income next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| Down payment assistance, this assists people who are purchasing a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| We're recommending keeping it at $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| $174,000 is the maximum we can put into administration for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| We're recommending that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Here is our annual allotment for the permit supportive housing to support the 10-year planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=4994)|
| 1:23:22| and chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| We're recommending $250,000 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| And then 19 and 20 are funds that are allocated to the nonprofit housing partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| the Community Housing Development Organizations, or CHODOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5014)|
| 1:23:38| We're required to put a minimum amount down 15%, and we typically do even more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| So we're recommending $450,000 for their construction of the homes and $50,000 for operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5025)|
| 1:23:56| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Does Habitat fit into any of that 19 and 20, or is that something entirely different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| Habitat is not a CHODO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| Neighborhood Housing Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I'm drawing a blank here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| East Tennessee Housing Development Corporation, which spun off from the Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Those are the three, and I believe CAC has recently formed as a CHODO as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5059)|
| 1:24:30| So any of them would be eligible, and they work with our housing team to apply for those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| Okay, so the emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| This is, again, another funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| It's own rules, and actually even only certain percentages of each grant can go for certain services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| And if you want details, Becky can explain it, but I'm going to move ahead and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5089)|
| 1:24:57| Okay, the CAC Homeward Bound, $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| Child and Family Crisis Center, $11,835.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| VMC for their day shelter housing first, $28,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| That was that small amount that Ms. Weatherstone mentioned the other night, the small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| YWCA, $12,000 for their transitional shelter residence program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| Samaritan Place Catholic Charities, $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| And the Crossroads Welcome Center for CARM, $12,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| We're allowed up to 5% for administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| This is just a teeny little bit of that that will apply towards admin because we got a little more than we had anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5134)|
| 1:25:43| We originally made the awards, and it's quite time-consuming to manage these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5143)|
| 1:25:49| So there you have the total emergency shelter grant and the grand total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| In addition, number 28 there, we also, through our fair housing, the investigations that our fair housing specialists do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5154)|
| 1:26:02| we get some money back as cases are closed in certain circumstances, and we're anticipating about $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5162)|
| 1:26:11| We supplement the staffing and the costs of that investigation and fair housing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| with our CDBG funds that come out of the admin cap that's listed number 8 on your page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5177)|
| 1:26:26| So then if you go back to the page, we're almost finished here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| You go back one page to the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| We will be receiving public comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| When the plan, both the consolidated plan and the annual plan, when it was released a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5201)|
| 1:26:49| we announced that the public comment would be received by email, postal mail, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5209)|
| 1:27:00| call us on the phone and tell us, come to public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| We will record all of that, and that does get included in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| We will have our public meeting, I'm going to mention this again in case anybody's watching now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| Tuesday, April 13th at 5.30 p.m. at the Kanzler YMCA, and we will be presenting a lot of this information again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5233)|
| 1:27:22| Council will consider this plan at your meeting on April 20th, and then we need to submit a plan to HUD by May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5242)|
| 1:27:33| Typically, this will start, then we await their approval, and then we start, when that comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| this plan will start July 1, and we'll be bringing most of these, the ones that have subrecipients that are over $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5259)|
| 1:27:48| I guess it is, we bring those to you for your approval for the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| Let me just tell you what I passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| These pages are to replace the ones that are in your binder in the annual action plan section towards the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5276)|
| 1:28:06| The ones that are in there now were based on estimates, and these are the actual proposed projects and accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5286)|
| 1:28:15| So the pages are numbered 7 through 12, and you can just pull out the other section and replace it with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| If I might, just before you leave, we did want to just show you the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| Those of you who were on the bus tour saw some of this, but here are some examples of our chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5310)|
| 1:28:36| On the left, top, and bottom, and on the right, these are ones that, the one on the right, 2329,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| we actually are targeting for acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| The left has been demolished and the lot cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| We're not planning to purchase this now, but the blight was mitigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| You all have approved two of these, actually three acquisitions on MLK and the 2900 block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5336)|
| 1:29:04| and we'll be bringing the fourth one, the one on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Actually, that was Spooky's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| It's not there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| It's demolished, but we're still planning to acquire that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| We'll issue an RFP for development most likely for those four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| and try to get something nice that will be a healthy and safe environment across from the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| and the people that live in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| Here's an example on Chestnut Street of removing commercial structures in a residential area to bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5367)|
| 1:29:36| That's what we do with our blighted property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Union Square Park, this is another way where we have put in the previous years some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| We're still finishing the project, and this is to improve that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| while we're also doing significant residential improvements through the KCDC Park City duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5388)|
| 1:29:58| There they are, and more are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| The new infill housing that's not too far from that park that Knox Housing Partnership did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| this is the lead gold houses that was developed with the Blighted Properties Fund from the EZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| That's the back side of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| Here's a before and after of a house on Jefferson Avenue that was an awful house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| and a lot of bad criminal elements hanging around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| And it's had a good redevelopment using a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| This is a loan fund that gets paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| Another property on Jefferson, you can see the difference with what a good rehab will do for a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| These are my front yards, the exterior improvements, facade improvements, Minnesota Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| Here's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| Look at the difference, just a driveway, some downspouts, and a storm door will make on a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| Owner-occupied rehabs, from left to right, you can see some of the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| Again, these are loans, low-interest loans that people get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| and we work with them and help them get their home rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| Here's a rental rehab on Milligan Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| We even got a roof on it, a better kind of roof, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| Commercial facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| Here's one on Magnolia, a commercial strip center in Shakeland and Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| What's the head-to-toes salon is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| It looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Here are some other facades that are pending on Magnolia, or in process, some of them, I think, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| On MLK, the old cleaners had a facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| It looks a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| Here's another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5507)|
| 1:31:48| This is in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| You can see the before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Of course, the heart of all the facade program is really Broadway and Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| That's really where it started and has moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| Here's the plumbing company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| The affordable condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| Another facade on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Jennings Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| There's actually two right there, the Ironwood Studio and the Body Shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| Look at the difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| There were no windows on the JFG building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| Look at the difference when they added windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Of course, our $50,000 only paid for a small portion of that, but it did help them make that project go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| Some more at Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| Okay, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| I know everyone's worn out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| As you prepare for a council meeting, if you have more questions, please call me or call Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| We'd be glad to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I had just one, if people don't shoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| In any of those programs, are there monies that facilitate private contractors to undertake the infill housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5581)|
| 1:33:10| In other words, you hear a lot of complaints that it's kind of a risky business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| You go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| The margins are tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Codes wears your butt out trying to get the things up to some modern standard that it may not even be capable of reaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| without ripping all the walls down and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Is there some program we have that will kind of get those hungry builders to actually do some of the work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| whether we buy the houses at the end of the tunnel or make loans easier to get or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| One example is the Blighted Property Redevelopment Program that I mentioned was easy funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| We showed a few examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| This is where a private developer, for speculation purposes that they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| or an individual family person who, if they want to buy it and fix up a house themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5635)|
| 1:34:01| we will give you a development loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| A lot of these houses, you can't go to the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| If you've got a blighted house, you can't go to the bank to get a development loan, a construction loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| It's very difficult to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| There's no security for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| We give them a no-interest loan that is paid back, like a six-month loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| They go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| They can purchase the property if they don't already own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| They can do the rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| They can do it themselves, hire the private contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| And then when it's finished, they either sell the property and then pay us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| or they get their own long-term financing if they're planning to continue to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| So you're a bridge loan in that sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| We're basically the banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| We're giving them the money to do the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| They pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| We're bridging between that and the long-term financing or the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| What about the city building codes people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| Can they find a way to help facilitate older house rehabilitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| I can't really speak to the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| You control them, but are you working with them to find a way to make that kind of easier shopping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5700)|
| 1:35:07| I'm assuming that every time you touch an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| it's got to be frustrating the amount of things that are under current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| But once you change about, what, 15% or 20% of the building's value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| you've got to come to current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Is there some rule like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| I'm going to defer to my construction folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| I think it's fair to say there could be more clarity in that process, even for us, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| Figuring out exactly how the building code applies to existing buildings is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| So I think that's an impediment we actually list in our consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| So we're in discussions with we have a good working relationship with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| But I think that's something, as we learn more about it, we could share with contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| We use private contractors on all the My Front Yard projects and our owner-occupied rehabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| And so I know a lot of them have come to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| during this time, we're the only work they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| So I'm saying there's probably a lot of hungry builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| If we can find a way to make this sort of attractive, we may get more done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| As he said, we are using them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| That's the model, is to use the private contractors to come in and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| I have one comment to make on the emergency shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| and that's about the Samaritan's Place Catholic Charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| I had an occasion to use that when I was a caregiver for my mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| and they are an excellent place for people who need relief who are caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| So I just wanted to mention that, that I have used that as an excellent place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| Other comments before we go into public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Any discussion items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| All right, well, let's move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| We have one person signed up, Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| Ron, come on up to the podium, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Yeah, Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| I just have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Ms. Wade, you made, or Ms. Rojero, made the comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| or I'm not sure which one of you actually said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| and referring to page 12, federal funds have been depleting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| What exactly does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| I think you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| I think what I'm, I don't know who said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| I think Ms. Wade did, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Yeah, what I meant was our federal funds have been going down for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| And they're actually not fully funded with CDBG fund based on our formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| On the other hand, we've also got new funds, such as the stimulus funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5877)|
| 1:37:58| So some funds have actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| we've had a $5.8 million, almost $6 million worth of new funds this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| that we never got before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| But the standard annual funds that you get, the CDBG, the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| at one time there was twice as much CDBG as there is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| And the stimulus money is we're going to receive for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| Three to four, depending on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| So generally speaking, the HUD, kind of the total package of the HUD money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| we're like half of what it was eight years ago, ten years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| I really, I don't know the exact figure, but I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Well, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| And then the only other question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| There are, and I should also say that there are other opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| there are proposals out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| there are several initiatives that are starting, whether we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| through the Obama administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| So there may be more funds coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| We don't know yet at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| You know, actually, that actually answered both questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| So you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| Thank you, Mr. Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Is there anybody else who wants to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Mr. Grieve, you look like you had something to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5949)|
| 1:39:18| I was just going to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| what I saw in there also is that you are looking to possibly do another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| supportive housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| And that's projected just based on previous projects that we funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5968)|
| 1:39:38| and the 10-year plans long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| That's what it's for in our budget that we will submit to HUD, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5987)|
| 1:39:57| And then the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| It can be with certain restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=5999)|
| 1:40:08| Depending on what the other project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| we might have to do an amendment to our plan that requires some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| But, yeah, even though none of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| we're not locked into any of these things, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| That's the answer, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| I mean, this is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| The plans can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| And what we do, and I mentioned earlier that when we identify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| when we develop our plan, we look at the mayor's priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| we leverage with other departments on what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| And as I mentioned, actually, at the council meeting the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| the administration and the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| our department have all been committed to homelessness issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| and particularly chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| So we set aside a certain amount of money every year for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| for a project to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| We don't drive the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| We provide the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| And the 10-year plan is who really comes up with the strategy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| But some of our funding supports other city initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| and this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| Have either of you gone to Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| and seen if there's a human being with hundreds of these notebooks reading them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| I would tell you that both of us have been to Washington several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| dealing with the stimulus dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| and it is amazing what actually I have a lot of compassion for the HUD staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6088)|
| 1:41:36| who all of a sudden got billions of dollars that within six weeks they had to come up with plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6096)|
| 1:41:43| This is for the neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| It was pretty close with the second stimulus last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| So there's a lot of furious activity going on to figure out how to develop plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| and spend money quicker than you ever have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| but with greater accountability and transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| It's been a real challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| The reason I ask that is I try to sit and read this without a very sharp pencil in case I fell over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| It's full of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| It's our cure for insomnia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6135)|
| 1:42:16| It is repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| I want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| I want to thank you and your staff for, I think, a very fine job, good presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| The bus tour was very informative, and it's a lot of work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| and you all seem to be doing a good job with it, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| And there's a great staff at Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| A few of them are here that you've got to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Yeah, I would like to thank Mark Grigsby and Emily Whittle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| They worked on the tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Some other people did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| They're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| But, I mean, it takes a lot of work to get that together, mapping it out, driving it, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6167)|
| 1:42:58| I have two sort of historical perspectives, having gone through this a few times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| and one thing that I learned is that all of the things that we approve next week at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6184)|
| 1:43:10| in the one-year plan actually come back again because as each project is funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| then it comes through in a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| So it's nice as a council member to have an opportunity to continue to revisit it throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| and kind of get updates as that funding goes out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| The other thing is just to thank the Community Development staff for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Every year that we have seen it under your direction, it has gotten more concise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| it's gotten more focused, it's tighter, and I think better focused on the critical priorities that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| Six years ago it felt like buckshot, and now it feels very targeted and very strategic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| So it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| Pray for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Pray for sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| I think we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Thank you, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| You all have a nice weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6240)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop100408?start=6250)|
