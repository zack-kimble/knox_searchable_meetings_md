| 2:49:53| They're counting on your word, meaning something, and that's why you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10193)|

| 2:50:22| Charlie Dorsett and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| Most people at my school this year, I've been doing very well with the mask requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| and they, we have had found ways to enjoy the school year, even with the adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10230)|
| 2:50:36| that have been had to be made because of the COVID pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| We have found ways around the requirements and the COVID precautions that schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10239)|
| 2:50:45| taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10245)|
| 2:50:46| We have done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10246)|
| 2:50:47| I mean, I personally as well have been able to enjoy the school year with all the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10251)|
| 2:50:52| It has still been very enjoyable for me and for other people, teachers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| I can only speak for myself, but a lot of my teachers have said that they've been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| to enjoy the school year as well as they have last year with masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10260)|
| 2:51:04| Now it's been hard on everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| There may have been ways that teachers have had to cope, ways that students have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| had to cope, but we've still been able to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| We have only eight and a half days left in the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| Many people that I've talked to, including myself, believe that it's important to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10277)|
| 2:51:22| wearing masks for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10282)|
| 2:51:24| Masks work best when everybody wears them, not when just a selected amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10284)|
| 2:51:31| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| I urge the board to keep the promise originally made to sunset the policy on August 1st, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| then follow the local health and safety guidelines at the beginning of next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10298)|
| 2:51:44| I don't like wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| It feels very restricting, but I wear it not just for my safety, but for the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| of people around me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| I hope that we don't have to wear them next year, but only time will tell, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| no way of knowing what cases are going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10320)|
| 2:52:03| Thank you, Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10323)|
| 2:52:14| Thank you, school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10334)|
| 2:52:15| I was not going to talk this evening, Tanya Coates, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| I wasn't going to talk this evening, however, as we're thinking about the next couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10339)|
| 2:52:26| days, the eight days that we have left in school, I know that this is not a topic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10346)|
| 2:52:33| you would want to continue to do, but as educators in Knox County, we feel like we've done the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10353)|
| 2:52:39| Muhammad Ali of the okie-doke of trying to lean back and take the punches, but we cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10359)|
| 2:52:47| continue to be in this fight and knowing that other things are going on around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10367)|
| 2:52:54| Just as yesterday and this past week on Monday, that the Senate House Bill 623 and House Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10374)|
| 2:53:04| 508 about the race theory bill that is going to jeopardize your schools next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| I'd hope that you would look into that and about the policies about what educators have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10392)|
| 2:53:17| to teach because you as a district will be penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10397)|
| 2:53:21| Hey, Ms. Coates, we need to stick with face masks right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| I'm sticking with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10405)|
| 2:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| It's talking about how it's all coming into together, how this can affect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10407)|
| 2:53:35| As just some of our last two speakers spoke about how these changes have, we have allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10415)|
| 2:53:41| face masks to dictate what you're doing here in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10421)|
| 2:53:47| That was just one policy in regards to our, in regards to what you're doing in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10427)|
| 2:53:53| but we're asking you in regards to face mask and reopening, these are ever changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10433)|
| 2:54:00| We're asking that you also continue to give the authority to the superintendent and his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10440)|
| 2:54:05| administration to do what's best for students as he has done for this last 200 days of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10445)|
| 2:54:13| We have spent all of our time in Knox County schools this year, less five days with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10453)|
| 2:54:20| policy that has worked well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| We have made sure that kids were safe and educators having to take on custodial duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10463)|
| 2:54:31| We have taken on duties of making sure that kids are showing up to school, but when it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10471)|
| 2:54:37| comes to, we cannot allow, or I'm asking you not to allow to be bullied by just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10477)|
| 2:54:47| it's where we don't want kids to not get friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10487)|
| 2:54:51| Our kids are resilient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| They have made friends this year, more than probably what I've made this year, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10494)|
| 2:55:00| asking that masks should not dictate one of your policies that you have that causes dissension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10506)|
| 2:55:07| Again, we, I thank you for what you have approved last August, you revisited in September, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10507)|
| 2:55:16| as of today, we have spent nearly over 15 hours over one policy that other policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10516)|
| 2:55:25| have been on the way side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| And we're just asking you to reconsider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10530)|
| 2:55:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10531)|
| 2:55:32| That concludes public forum on the face mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10532)|
| 2:55:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10536)|
| 2:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| Comments, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| Can somebody repeat the motion that's on the floor for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10540)|
| 2:55:46| I had stepped out to use the restroom when it was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| It's the motion on the floor is to approve the amendment to policy C-240 and the revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10551)|
| 2:55:59| to the 2020-2021 reopening plan consistent with the amended policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| Thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| I would like to amend, make a motion to amend the policy to just say the face mask requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10569)|
| 2:56:18| will end on Wednesday, May 26th and just end it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10588)|
| 2:56:29| So, Ms. Christie is offering a substitute motion and Ms. Henderson, could you second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10589)|
| 2:56:35| that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10595)|
| 2:56:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10602)|
| 2:56:43| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10604)|
| 2:56:45| I was just going to wait since that was a substitute motion, but I don't know, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10605)|
| 2:56:53| stop me if this is not relevant, but I did have a clarification that I wanted to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10613)|
| 2:57:01| because last month I asked why do these people keep saying we promised, but, and I had no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10621)|
| 2:57:07| answer, but now I think I understand a little better with the email that went out from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10627)|
| 2:57:13| elementary supervisor that stated, however, Knox County Schools has not moved to green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| as a district at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| And we have made a commitment to our parents of virtual students who returned to our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10641)|
| 2:57:25| in January that we would follow our reopening plan through the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10645)|
| 2:57:32| I would just like some explanation from the superintendent, the elementary supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| someone in Knox County that it can explain to me because I don't remember voting on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10657)|
| 2:57:43| commitment to the virtual students as a board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10663)|
| 2:57:47| I don't remember this ever being discussed, so I don't know how this promise was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| to the virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| So, I'd just like some clarification because we've heard both sides believe the promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10673)|
| 2:58:02| was made or the metrics were supposed to be looked at, so how did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| Who wants to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| In terms of the reopening plan, we, when it was approved, it was for the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10690)|
| 2:58:16| so I don't know that any promise, where does it say promise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| That was in the email from the elementary supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| It wasn't promise, it was a commitment to our parents of virtual students who returned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10703)|
| 2:58:29| to school in January that we would follow our reopening plan through the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10709)|
| 2:58:33| school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10713)|
| 2:58:34| But, and I think some of the problem is, respectfully, Ms. Superintendent Thomas, is that, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10714)|
| 2:58:44| understood, maybe other members of the board thought differently, but I understood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10724)|
| 2:58:49| the metrics weighed very heavily on what we would do, and I also remember it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| talk of a fluid as we saw what developed with the virus, but now we pretty much have learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10734)|
| 2:59:02| that the metrics were only a small part of that, and it has more to do with consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10742)|
| 2:59:08| with the health department and others, so I don't know, I just, it concerns me that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10748)|
| 2:59:18| I don't know, I just don't think, I guess that was a part of the reopening plan, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| didn't understand the reopening plan the way evidently it was interpreted by the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10764)|
| 2:59:29| and the superintendent, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| Thank you, Ms. Founds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10772)|
| 2:59:34| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10774)|
| 2:59:35| Let Mr. Watson go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10775)|
| 2:59:38| Well, there were several people in front of, before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| Okay, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| I wanted to note just a few things, and I'll ask Mr. Dugler to correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| on any of this first part that I'm about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| First, Williamson County Schools, I'd like to be sure everyone understands, they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| still following their mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| There has been no court ruling saying that they cannot follow their mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10800)|
| 3:00:05| They sent out email clarification, and their mask mandate is still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10805)|
| 3:00:12| That the judge was not convinced regarding the board's authority, that didn't have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| to do with a court ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10817)|
| 3:00:18| It was simply a note, it was not a finding in a trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| There hasn't been a court ruling regarding face mask use in schools in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| What is referenced is a motion to dismiss, which was filed by the defendant, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| Williamson County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| They filed a motion to dismiss, and the majority of that motion to dismiss was upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| So it's not that Williamson County lost a case, it's that they won their motion to dismiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10841)|
| 3:00:51| So it's really the opposite of what is being presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| And the fact that their mask mandate is still in place should be fairly significant to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10858)|
| 3:01:05| The requests that I'm hearing tonight are to end this policy immediately, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10865)|
| 3:01:09| not at all what's on our agenda for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| What we are considering is whether to sunset this policy two months earlier than the August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| 1st date that we had already agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10878)|
| 3:01:23| Our summer programs are what will be affected by this, and we really need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10883)|
| 3:01:31| the fact that if we change this policy for our summer programs, we are changing the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10891)|
| 3:01:38| for the one group that made a choice to come with that mandate in place, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10898)|
| 3:01:45| what they were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10905)|
| 3:01:48| And if I could ask Dr. Reisig to answer a couple of questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| Can you tell me how many students we have signed up for summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10918)|
| 3:02:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10920)|
| 3:02:02| Thank you, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| I think our number was 5,850 when the window closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10923)|
| 3:02:08| Okay, so the window is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10928)|
| 3:02:10| So even if we changed our policy tonight, people that that would have impacted, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10930)|
| 3:02:17| can't sign up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| So if someone did not choose summer because of the mask mandate, they can't change their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10941)|
| 3:02:29| mind and sign up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| The state requirements around the summer schools required a 30-day window for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10952)|
| 3:02:39| application process, and that window closed on April 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| So at that point, those were the numbers we used to base building out the summer programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10962)|
| 3:02:47| and staffing, and are set to start that on June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10967)|
| 3:02:50| So there's no additional window at this point planned to be open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10970)|
| 3:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10975)|
| 3:02:56| So, Madam Chair, my understanding here is that we're not helping anyone by changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10982)|
| 3:03:03| If we move it to May 26th, we're impacting people who chose to come to summer school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10983)|
| 3:03:09| knowing that there was a mask requirement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10989)|
| 3:03:13| We're not helping anyone because people who don't want that mask mandate can't sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10999)|
| 3:03:20| It's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11000)|
| 3:03:23| Over and over, we hear that communication is a problem, and we are part of that communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11008)|
| 3:03:29| We are a huge part of that communication problem because month after month after month, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11009)|
| 3:03:35| telling people that we're talking about changing the policy, and that shouldn't be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| When we've made a decision, we should be able to stick by our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| Month after month after month, our integrity is being called into question, and our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| is distrusting us more and more because we're telling them, oh, no, we're going to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| and talk about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11037)|
| 3:03:59| We need to be able to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11039)|
| 3:04:03| If it requires two readings, we should be able to take two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| If there's an emergency situation, we can make an adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| But to make a decision and then bring it back again and again and again and again with little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11051)|
| 3:04:22| tiny tweaks in the hopes that it is somehow going to be a different outcome, that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11062)|
| 3:04:29| not fair to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11069)|
| 3:04:32| It doesn't cause them to trust us, and it doesn't feel like we have integrity there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11072)|
| 3:04:42| I know that our administration took a poll of our principals a while back, and if I remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| correctly, 75% wanted to keep it in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11087)|
| 3:04:52| Why are we working so hard against our school administrators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11092)|
| 3:04:57| It doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11097)|
| 3:04:58| The CDC recommendations have not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11098)|
| 3:05:03| Nothing there has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| They still recommend a face covering worn correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11106)|
| 3:05:13| They do not recommend a medical device because this face covering is not a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11113)|
| 3:05:19| That also needs to be pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| It is very clearly stated that it is not a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11121)|
| 3:05:28| I have tried to find a reason, some kind of motivation that this policy would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| again and again and again, and I can't find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11134)|
| 3:05:38| The only reason that I could begin to find is that there's some kind of political statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11138)|
| 3:05:45| and we shouldn't be here making a political statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| We should be here doing what is right for our students, and to continually go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11149)|
| 3:05:56| forth and back and forth and back and forth is not right for our families, it's not right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11156)|
| 3:06:01| for our students, it's not fair to the community, and it just needs to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11161)|
| 3:06:07| We voted for a sunset date, and we need to have the integrity to stick by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11167)|
| 3:06:15| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11175)|
| 3:06:17| Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| Just to go back and to address some of the things that Ms. Owen said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| First of all, I have always seen vaccine availability as being an end point to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11187)|
| 3:06:35| I mean, as most of you all know, I have a child in the hospital today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11195)|
| 3:06:39| I've walked by the vaccine clinic at UT more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| Those people are bored out of their minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| No one is in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| I was walking through Walmart last week, and they were announcing overhead that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11208)|
| 3:06:54| we have vaccines in the pharmacy right now if you can come up and get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11214)|
| 3:06:58| I mean, at some point, we have to start talking about an exit strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11218)|
| 3:07:04| I mean, by this time, I mean by August, you know, pretty much anyone who wants a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11224)|
| 3:07:10| seventh grade and up will have had an opportunity to have gotten one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11230)|
| 3:07:14| So, I mean, I do think that a lot has changed, and that has to be taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11234)|
| 3:07:20| So, I would definitely support just ending on the 26th, finishing out the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11240)|
| 3:07:28| and I do think we need to talk about, as Ms. Bowne said last month, what we're going to do in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11248)|
| 3:07:36| you know, and readdress that maybe next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11256)|
| 3:07:41| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11261)|
| 3:07:43| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11263)|
| 3:07:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| I guess I have just a couple questions before we get around to voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11267)|
| 3:07:54| One, in regard to outdoor activities, field day for elementary, I guess field day is the big activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11274)|
| 3:08:13| Are they allowed for parents to attend at this point or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11293)|
| 3:08:22| I think the communication that went out was that what we had in the reopening plan, that parents would not attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11302)|
| 3:08:29| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| It's an outdoor activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| Well, it's an outdoor activity, but that was just what was in the reopening plan that was approved by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11313)|
| 3:08:40| So, that's what we try to stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| I don't mean to be bitter with you, Bob, but there are an awful lot of parents that want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11324)|
| 3:08:55| It's my understanding at some schools they've been told that they could, so there's a lack of consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11335)|
| 3:09:04| At this point, if it's an outdoor activity, I don't care if they have to go through the building in order to get outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11344)|
| 3:09:14| I don't understand why they shouldn't be allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11354)|
| 3:09:21| We surveyed, again, surveyed the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| The recommendation from principals was, hey, let's follow the policy that we have until the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11365)|
| 3:09:32| That's what we supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| The inconsistency, we can deal with that on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| Well, will you deal with it firmly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11378)|
| 3:09:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11381)|
| 3:09:42| I'm talking about firmly. I'm not talking about just don't do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11382)|
| 3:09:46| I mean, if we're going to make rules and then just let administrators do whatever they want to on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11386)|
| 3:09:58| because they happen to be the administrator of a given school, then I think the public will get down on us pretty quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11398)|
| 3:10:09| and they probably should, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11409)|
| 3:10:16| Excuse me. We can't hear the speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11416)|
| 3:10:20| Now, something else that at this point I guess I want to ask is I know the 26th is before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11420)|
| 3:10:33| and we've heard two or three people talk against it, and there's some people that don't really care, I'm sure, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11433)|
| 3:10:44| But if we were to lift it any earlier than the 26th, would there be any support for that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11444)|
| 3:11:02| Does it have to be the 26th or nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| Anybody want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| I have talked to all the principals in my district, and I know you don't care, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11473)|
| 3:11:19| but I respect them, that they feel like they have put processes in place to get through the school year, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11479)|
| 3:11:27| I can support ending it on the 26th, but I will not support ending it before the 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11487)|
| 3:11:32| Okay, let me ask you since you—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11492)|
| 3:11:34| You just wanted to know, and that's my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| I want to know something else since you have so much contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11496)|
| 3:11:40| What are your principals doing about field day in the elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11500)|
| 3:11:45| Since I got blessed out by one of the parents of one of the schools, I'm pretty sure—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| Sometimes, you know, I don't disrespect or mean to imply that I disrespect principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11510)|
| 3:12:00| They do a great job, and it's a tough job, but just because they feel a given way, they're appointed over that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11520)|
| 3:12:14| We are elected to carry on for all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11534)|
| 3:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11544)|
| 3:12:25| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11546)|
| 3:12:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11548)|
| 3:12:30| So, especially because I was not on the board when some of these decisions were originally made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11550)|
| 3:12:36| I felt like it was important to kind of go back and kind of look at the evolution of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11556)|
| 3:12:41| because the conversation has continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11561)|
| 3:12:44| And so, just briefly, on July 15th, the reopening plan was approved 9-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11564)|
| 3:12:51| and that kicked off the window for parents to make a decision-related virtual instruction between July 15th and 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11571)|
| 3:12:59| I think I would assume the reason it was approved on July 15th is so parents could make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| And then on August 12th, Approval 8-1, Policy C-240, was put into place to provide more clarity about the implementation of face coverings in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11584)|
| 3:13:15| And then, I'm assuming that was approved on August 12th, because August 24th, school was going to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| and that was an important decision to make prior to school starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| The next window of time that we had was between October 26th and November 6th, or Spring 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11605)|
| 3:13:31| And on November 11th and December 9th, we had discussions on contact tracing and masks, predominantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11611)|
| 3:13:37| And then on February 10th, we had a regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| Item 6-H was to discuss the issue again with possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11620)|
| 3:13:45| There was no action that came that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| On March 3rd, then, we had the report on the Colorado study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11627)|
| 3:13:50| And then we had another window of time, March 3rd through April 20th, for people to make decisions about summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11630)|
| 3:14:01| And as Dr. Reiswitz pointed out earlier, we had 5,850 sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11641)|
| 3:14:06| The other thing that I asked, because I was curious about this, is how many students that have been virtual signed up for summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11646)|
| 3:14:14| 17% of our students in summer school have been in virtual school this semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11654)|
| 3:14:21| That's roughly 1,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| There's also no virtual option for summer school. Is that true, Dr. Reiswitz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11664)|
| 3:14:30| And so those students who have been virtual have made that choice to go to summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11670)|
| 3:14:36| And I would assume that's because virtual, for some of them, maybe has been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11676)|
| 3:14:40| And so they've opted to get this additional support that we've committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11680)|
| 3:14:45| And then on April 7th, we had discussion again on Policy C-240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| And then on April 14th, we had discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11690)|
| 3:14:54| And we took action that night, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11694)|
| 3:14:58| So the first action that we took was a vote 5-4, and that was to approve Superintendent Thomas's plan for 21-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11698)|
| 3:15:07| And I know the thing that I elevated that night, and the thing I've really been trying to elevate since the beginning of these conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11707)|
| 3:15:13| is that the public needs to know, from this body, who it's going to look to for guidance related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11713)|
| 3:15:21| And we've heard over all these discussions, lots of different people being elevated about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11721)|
| 3:15:26| but they're saying this, or they're saying this, or they're saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| And none of us are medical professionals in the sense of acting on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11729)|
| 3:15:34| And so we need to give the public that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| And in that plan, it says that we're going to follow the Tennessee Department of Health recommendations related to COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11737)|
| 3:15:45| And I've said many times to people who have asked me, whatever they say, I'm down with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11745)|
| 3:15:52| I voted 5-4 for that to be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| We also, that same night, voted 8-1 to sunset – or to pause the first – or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11755)|
| 3:16:05| And the reason we did that, I believe, being in that discussion, is because we thought it was really important to make a final decision that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11765)|
| 3:16:13| And so 8-1, we approved to not have second reading on the mask policy, C-240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11773)|
| 3:16:20| And immediately following that, 9-0, this board approved that it would sunset on August 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11780)|
| 3:16:28| So, then April – and we had discussions that night about what happens when the governor does his thing on April 28th, whatever he may do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11788)|
| 3:16:38| And on the 27th, Governor Lee passed Executive Order 80, Mayor Jacobs ended the mask mandate in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11798)|
| 3:16:45| We then had a subsequent emergency – or special call meeting on April 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11805)|
| 3:16:50| That agenda was not approved, and we didn't have a discussion about the item then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11810)|
| 3:16:54| I know I didn't approve the agenda that morning because, from my understanding, from the law department, from Mr. Dupler, is the decision that we made prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11814)|
| 3:17:05| there was nothing that the governor or the mayor did that circumvented that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| And then on May 5th, last week, we had more conversation about possibly sunsetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11830)|
| 3:17:17| And now on May 11th, we all got emails about the Citizens for Limited Government v. Golden and WCVOE that actually occurred on April 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11837)|
| 3:17:30| And now we are discussing this one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| I want to point the attention to the board of – to Policy B.1.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11853)|
| 3:17:38| Policy B.1.12 talks about the duties of board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| There's not many. There's only about eight, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| But No. 6 says to accept the will of the majority vote in all cases and give support to the resulting action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11865)|
| 3:17:54| I've done that on this board, and I've seen this board do that in a lot of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11874)|
| 3:18:00| This has been the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| Mr. Dupler, if you can tell me tonight that something has changed that makes the decision we made on April 14th moot, then I will vote for another decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11883)|
| 3:18:16| But unless that occurs, I will pass on all votes relating to our mask policy or COVID guidelines because I think, as an elected official, the public needs to be able to trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11896)|
| 3:18:29| And when we act as a board, no matter what the decision is, I think we need to, in good faith, live out that decision until the circumstances change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11909)|
| 3:18:39| And I've not yet heard at this point that the circumstances have changed, although we got really good news today that it sounds like we're going to be able to get vaccines for 12- to 15-year-olds promptly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11919)|
| 3:18:51| So I'm excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| So, Mr. Dupler, is there anything that has happened that has made our decision on April 14th moot from a legal standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11933)|
| 3:19:06| Mr. Dupler, would you like to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11946)|
| 3:19:11| Yeah, thanks, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11951)|
| 3:19:15| I mean, that's not an easy question to tackle because—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11955)|
| 3:19:19| I don't want to give you easy questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| Because things have happened, and things have happened recently, but your question is, has there been a legal mandate, as I understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11962)|
| 3:19:37| I mean, has there been something from a judge, something from the governor, something from the Tennessee Health Department, something like that, saying that schools must remove masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11977)|
| 3:19:52| There has not been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11992)|
| 3:19:55| But there has been what I would call considerations for this board to look at, and that would be what's been talked about, which is both in public forum and this board, which is the governor's latest executive order, the mayor's proclamation, and this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=11995)|
| 3:20:15| Although it's not binding, it is—it's a Williamson County case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12015)|
| 3:20:22| It is—it was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12022)|
| 3:20:25| I mean, what Ms. Owen said was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| The time for appeal has not lapsed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| It doesn't lapse until the end of the month, so not saying that it couldn't be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12033)|
| 3:20:40| But it didn't come from a Knox County judge, so it's not binding at all on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12040)|
| 3:20:46| But these are considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| That's the way the law department would describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12048)|
| 3:20:51| So, yes, there's certainly been things that have happened, and lots of people have done—made different decisions related to decisions outside of Knox County schools directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12051)|
| 3:21:01| So—but in your legal opinion, if the board were to let its decision stand that it made on August 14th related to following the Tennessee Department of Health for 21-22 and sunsetting the mask policy on August 1st, are we acting outside of our scope legally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12061)|
| 3:21:25| There's—there's nothing legally at this point to restrict the board from doing that or from changing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12085)|
| 3:21:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12097)|
| 3:21:38| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| So, as I outlined to the board just a few minutes ago, in good faith, we've had many, many conversations about this, and we have listened to public forum speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12099)|
| 3:21:50| I actually went back because I was kind of curious how many total unique speakers we've had, because we've certainly had some repeat guests who have passionately spoke to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12110)|
| 3:22:02| And in that time, since November 11th, we've had 40 unique speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12122)|
| 3:22:09| So we've had 40 unique speakers in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| We've heard them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| We—and we got to the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12134)|
| 3:22:17| After many times on the agenda, it's saying discussion and possible action, we got to a place of action on April 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| And I will be following our policy B-112 and accepting the will of the majority of the board that night, and I will be passing on the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12143)|
| 3:22:34| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12156)|
| 3:22:38| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| I just think when you have policies during a pandemic, you have to be flexible, and waiting two extra months is not being flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12160)|
| 3:22:46| And as Ms. Christie said, the vaccine is available to the majority of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12166)|
| 3:22:51| That should be the end game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| And it's the right time to visit this because of the governor's decision, the mayor's decision, our COVID-related metrics are in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12173)|
| 3:23:00| So I just think it is the right time to revisit this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12180)|
| 3:23:05| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| Yeah, I mean, I think you bring up a good point just about the metrics, because if you actually go by our metrics, one would reasonably think that we would be in green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12186)|
| 3:23:17| So for that reason, it seems that if we were in green, we wouldn't have masks anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12197)|
| 3:23:23| So I don't know whose light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12203)|
| 3:23:27| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12207)|
| 3:23:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| I just want to remind some of the folks who were present at the time of a policy review meeting that happened not this past February, but the February before, where there was some very impassioned feeling about sticking with a decision that had been made by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12211)|
| 3:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12237)|
| 3:24:00| I just wanted to be noted that my statements are not about us following what we said we're going to do with fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12240)|
| 3:24:06| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12246)|
| 3:24:07| We need to do what we said with fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12247)|
| 3:24:10| And so if our plan states that green, then masks aren't going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12250)|
| 3:24:15| That's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| My statement is more about this particular policy, and the policy came out of the plan, which means, in my mind, that the plan should be followed as designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12257)|
| 3:24:33| We also know, as many people have discussed tonight, that's not always done with efficacy and fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12273)|
| 3:24:41| And so, again, I just want to be noted that us dropping this policy is not going to make all of that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12281)|
| 3:24:47| We are still going to have issues with the way different policies and different things get implemented in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12287)|
| 3:24:54| Again, I just think that the board is acting on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12301)|
| 3:25:02| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12302)|
| 3:25:05| Without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12305)|
| 3:25:06| Ms. Coatney, if you'll do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| And can we be clear what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12310)|
| 3:25:13| Can you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12313)|
| 3:25:17| I believe Ms. Christie's substitute motion was to approve the policy as amended by changing the sunset date to May 26, 2021, and Ms. Henderson seconded that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12317)|
| 3:25:29| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12329)|
| 3:25:32| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12332)|
| 3:25:35| Does that leave us with no plan during summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12335)|
| 3:25:42| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| So there's no language there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12344)|
| 3:25:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12351)|
| 3:25:52| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12352)|
| 3:25:54| So as I understand it, the superintendent has a plan for the fall, and that was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12354)|
| 3:26:04| So if you sunset the policy, then what Ms. Owen says would be correct, and there would not be any no policy nor plan in effect for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12364)|
| 3:26:18| Thank you, Mr. Duplo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12378)|
| 3:26:30| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12390)|
| 3:26:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12391)|
| 3:26:32| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12393)|
| 3:26:34| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12394)|
| 3:26:35| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12399)|
| 3:26:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12400)|
| 3:26:41| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12402)|
| 3:26:43| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12403)|
| 3:26:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12404)|
| 3:26:45| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12405)|
| 3:26:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12406)|
| 3:26:47| Yes votes and three no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12407)|
| 3:26:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12408)|
| 3:26:54| Was it two or was it passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12414)|
| 3:26:58| Two nay votes and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| I just wanted clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12421)|
| 3:27:05| So in the agenda, maybe I'm just missing something, and again, I did step out for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12425)|
| 3:27:11| Was that first reading, or did we suspend for second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12431)|
| 3:27:16| We did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| Okay, and I think we have a public forum speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12440)|
| 3:27:21| Yes, and we thank you very patiently for waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| Loren Seagrave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12444)|
| 3:27:30| Please state your name and county of residence, and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12450)|
| 3:27:38| My name is Loren Seagrave, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| I am a senior at Austin East, and I am in the top ten with a 4.1 GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12462)|
| 3:27:48| I have won first in multiple state acting competitions hosted by Thistle and qualified for nationals held by NSDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12468)|
| 3:27:56| I'm saying this to make sure you listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12476)|
| 3:27:59| After I was told by someone close to me that it would be near impossible for you to change your opinion on mandatory searches at Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12479)|
| 3:28:09| I decided that this speech isn't about that one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12489)|
| 3:28:14| It's about the decisions you make for Austin East in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12494)|
| 3:28:18| I didn't know what to say the first day I saw officers swarming my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12498)|
| 3:28:22| We came back after what happened at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| I was unbelievably hurt, and the first thing I thought was about speaking to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12506)|
| 3:28:30| and having my words somewhat fall flat as they went in one ear and out the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12510)|
| 3:28:35| Some of the things you have done after it happened were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| You installed a new security system that alerts not just the office but the surrounding area with a loud sound when a door is opened without a proximity card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12519)|
| 3:28:47| But after a traumatic event happened with some students in the same hallway hearing the gunshots and screams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12527)|
| 3:28:54| you found it fit to search students with clear backpacks every morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12534)|
| 3:28:58| I have to look officers in the eye every single morning and tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12538)|
| 3:29:03| yeah, I'm okay, as I empty my pockets and give them my Chromebook and folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12543)|
| 3:29:08| I am then wandered down as I hear statements like, you know, they do this every day in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12548)|
| 3:29:16| I don't really care what you think about the situation because I'm not here to change your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12556)|
| 3:29:22| But Anthony brought a gun into the school not through the back doors that we enter through at the beginning of the school day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12562)|
| 3:29:29| but through a propped open door as he reentered the school at the end of the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12569)|
| 3:29:36| So I can't wrap my mind around the police searches every day at 830 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12576)|
| 3:29:43| I don't know about you, but having a metal detector close to your body as you start your day is really depressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12583)|
| 3:29:52| And you know deep down that if these clear backpacks and mandatory searches were at somewhere like Farragut or West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12592)|
| 3:30:00| you would be berated by every parent and teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12600)|
| 3:30:03| You are now putting a story to every kid that goes to that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12603)|
| 3:30:08| And it's unbelievably dangerous because when I'm interacting with people who've heard that story, they view me as a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12608)|
| 3:30:17| I know you have a couple of schools where the majority of the students are black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12617)|
| 3:30:24| So you really need to focus on what I'm about to say instead of whatever biases, conscious or unconscious, you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12624)|
| 3:30:32| There are two things you can do to transform these schools into places of either to blossom education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12632)|
| 3:30:39| and the young hurt minds of students or funnels and pipelines that take the students in your schools and put them in private prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12639)|
| 3:30:47| And if you don't see the negative police encounters and them seeing school as an entrapment to escape harmful for a student whose relatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12647)|
| 3:31:00| or family and friends have been that have been killed by and imprisoned by cops, then we've already lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12660)|
| 3:31:09| I showed you the choice you had last time I was here, and it's clear that you've at least for the moment decided to kneel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12669)|
| 3:31:17| If you don't do anything, then you've killed a whole entire generation of black people, not just their bodies, but their spirits, dreams and hope for a better future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12677)|
| 3:31:27| I've been walking around the halls of your school like a zombie because I'm already dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12687)|
| 3:31:34| Because. I'm viewed as a thug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12694)|
| 3:31:41| Thank you. Thank you for coming to speak to us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12701)|
| 3:31:48| Thank you. We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=12708)|
