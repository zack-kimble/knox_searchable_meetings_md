| 0:11:11| The clerk also advised there's a form you can fill out and affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| And we know that beer has been there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| This is an off-premises license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Do you own the building now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| I just bought it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| Do you have a business partner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And are you going to operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| So I'm going to ask these folks to your left, my right, a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Beer board inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Application for permits and obtaining a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| I'll defer to the commission, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=735)|
| 0:12:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=736)|
| 0:12:17| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| We're now moving to discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Discuss drive-through beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| I'm not sure who had this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Mr. Lautrec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| The commission, quite a few months back, asked me to look into the feasibility of determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| whether or not we should or could have a county-wide ordinance that essentially precluded drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I engaged the University of Tennessee Technical Advisory Service and the Institute for Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Service to do some basic research for us, which gives you an idea of the smattering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| of counties that actually have these permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| But in the interim, the state attorney general has issued an opinion that I think is well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| supported by competent case law that the county is not empowered to just have a blanket no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| drive-through beer sales policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Rather, we'd have to look at each individual applicant to see whether or not that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| applicant poses a threat to the local community by way of health welfare and safety, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| traffic congestion, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| So in a nutshell, I don't think we should try to move forward with an ordinance, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| rather just look at each individual drive-through beer applicant on its own merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| That would be the safe and legally defensible way to approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| Any questions for our law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| If not, the second item, 6B, is to discuss karaoke piracy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| So let me begin our discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| I was asked to come to Mayor Burchett's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| I was going to say that Commissioner Smith is going to demo this before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| He explains the eye patch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| He does a great job of singing feelings, so we can have him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| I was asked to come to a meeting at Mayor Burchett's office, and there we had representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| from Karaoke Cafe and another organization talking about the issues that they face with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| what we call illegal karaoke piracy issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| It's a very serious matter because you're talking about millions of dollars in lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| revenue to those who are legitimate business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| What happens is that people who operate karaoke establishments, they will get their music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| through illegal downloads, through just taping or making copies of someone's music, or they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| get it from those who are selling it when they shouldn't be selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| So, for those legitimate businesses, it is an issue, and it does represent lost revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| They've actually had to lay people off and cut back on the scope of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| We have some representatives here from Karaoke Cafe who can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| One of the things that we had talked about doing in the Mayor's office, and Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| agreed, is that we send a letter from the beer board to those who have karaoke, informing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| them of the law, because it is a federal law, and it does carry substantial penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| So, rather than us going and trying to do something, it's more of an informative thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| at this point to let them know of what the law is, and to make them aware of it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| to ask them to please comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| So, with that, I'll be asking, if it's alright, if we ask our law director to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| ahead and send a letter, just discussing the fact that this is a problem, asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| to comply with the law, and that was pretty much what we had discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| But, again, the folks are here from karaoke, and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| I guess I'm trying to understand what context we're approaching this from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| When you say the beer board, in terms of the law, are there any restrictions based on alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Is that why we're sending it from the beer board, and not just from county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and why we're discussing this in beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Because, to me, it seems like a violation of the law, independent of where alcohol is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| We could send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Yes, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| We could send it on behalf of county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| But this was the proper venue, because most of the places that do karaoke also sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| or alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Okay, I would suggest that, I mean, if we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| From the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| If we do this, is this going to affect the lawsuits that are now pending in an adverse way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| I'll ask our Mr. Law Director, if we send a letter from county commission just informing people of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| and asking them to comply with the law, does this have anything to do with any pending lawsuits with this adversity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| I mean, you're putting them on notice just essentially of the ability of the commission to enforce its current laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| But, you know, again, commission is really not empowered to file civil lawsuits because we're not a party in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| Our interest is in enforcing our beer ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| And if someone's conducting any kind of illegal activity, that puts their license in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| Just merely an advisory letter putting them on notice assists us if we have to go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| because then they can, of course, claim that they were not on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Well, my concern was that, number one, that it would not affect anything that is pending now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| because what I understand there's about 20 so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| The second question would be, is this going to be a ticketable offense by whom, the beer inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1041)|
| 0:17:34| Are we going to wait and depend on lawsuits to be filed in this, or how are we going to control it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| What is our obligations with regards to this, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Well, you know, again, enforceability of any of these, everything from gambling machines to something of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| it would have to really consist of either a complaint being filed with the Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| or during a routine inspection, it's in plain view that it's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| But beyond that, if you're going to actually try to have a more aggressive enforcement action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| you can obviously see the mechanics involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| You're going to have to get involved with the Sheriff's Department, even talk about possibly additional manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1089)|
| 0:18:14| I think what a letter normally does, it dissuades at least 90 percent of the people who are tempted to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| You're always going to have your hardcore violators, just like you do with gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| Well, we presumably have 20 offenders right now, presumably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| What is our relationship to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Are they going to be brought before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| We can't do it until after the lawsuits, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| No, the intent here is not to aggressively enforce this or to bring people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| It's just as an information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Most people don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I mean, they're not aware of the fact that if they buy music from an illegal distributor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| and they may not even know they're illegal distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And so the whole purpose of this is just to inform them of a letter asking them to comply with the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| and to just comply with any of the music that they buy that they buy from reputable vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| I mean, do we need a formal action that we send a letter on behalf of the commission from the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Also move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| There you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| It's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Do we need a formal or will you just go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| That's the express will of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Again, since it's not a resolution or an ordinance, we can certainly generate a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| If it's okay with the commission, we'll just ask the law director to send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| And so we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Our next item is a discussion of the method for measuring distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| Did you folks have anything you wanted to say from the karaoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| I would like to thank everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| We really appreciate your help in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I know there's not a lot you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| We're doing the most of the work, but your support is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Our next item is discussion of the method for measuring distance requirements for beer establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| Our beer inspector asked me to put this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| So, UK, if you'll tell us what you're wanting us to look at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| Mr. Chairman, back in 76, the state county restricted Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| and we got an ordinance back in 93 stating 500 foot from residential or agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1213)|
| 0:20:24| We've done for 19 years the closest point of the building to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1224)|
| 0:20:33| And the reason we've done that, we can't use a church or a school anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| What we looked at was in residential or agricultural, any church or school is built mostly on agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1242)|
| 0:20:58| And I would like for you all to exactly how you want it measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Some says from property line to property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| We went from building to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| So, if you all put that in an ordinance the way that you want it done, we're going to know how to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1272)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. Jarrett, is this a resolution we need or how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| I'd like to look into this because, again, the Tennessee Code does provide for patios and appurtenances there through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1290)|
| 0:21:40| It's very difficult to have a one-size-fits-all policy, but we'd also have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| You've got to remember there's also the underlying code dealing with our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| It could affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| So, this is going to, you know, before we start rewriting both the zoning code, the bureau ordinance, I'll need to investigate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| And I'll report back to the commission next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Our law director will look into it and report back to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Looking at the state for a little bit of guidance, the August 2010 revision, they use building to building as their measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1324)|
| 0:22:19| So, I just want to point that out, opening the discussion for where do we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1339)|
| 0:22:29| And then there is one other thing that I want to say something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| Just in passing conversation, commissioners no longer compose the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1352)|
| 0:22:40| but as I read this 2010 edition of the state beer regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1360)|
| 0:22:51| the only place that the word beer can be spoken and something done to regulate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| is either through the county legislative body or its appointed beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| It so happens we said it's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| But I believe in the last couple of months there has been something before the BZA about a distance related to beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| And I believe that we need to all be reminded that the only place you speak about beer would be with county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| or with a sitting beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| I think in the instance, Commissioner, what you're dealing with is an individual went before the BZA and asked for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| And I believe the purpose of the variance was to be able to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| And the distance in that particular appeal was the appeal was based on distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| And the only organization in Knox County that can set that distance is the sitting commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Not even the beer board can change the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| It's the commission that the legislative body controls the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1433)|
| 0:23:59| And there's no appeal to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| That's the law if we're going by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Well, you know, you've deferred these decisions to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| That's why I said earlier that needs to be investigated because we have too many possibly competing statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| And I've looked at this before, but we do need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| Mr. Chairman, I made a mistake on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| I said property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| That's a zoning line in Measure 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| So I wanted to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| One other issue that's come up, I'd just like to kind of throw out here for a little discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| is the fact that with the advent of liquor being passed a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| we're starting to get some permits, applications in for places in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1489)|
| 0:24:59| And our qualifications differ from the state laws as far as who can and what can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| What I understand, that state law on liquor must govern over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So we need to be looking at maybe making our qualifications the same as the state qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1513)|
| 0:25:22| for being able to get a colonization, say, beer and liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Well, the state's preempted all liquor licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Liquor by the drink, we can't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| You can deal with beer only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| But we can make ours match the state's, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| So you want to think about taking your beer ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| and maybe it can comport to the state liquor requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| You want me to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Well, if you're going to have to issue a permit, we're going to have to have some basic qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| And if they can get liquor but no beer, it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| If they get liquor by state law, we have to give them a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| If they get liquor first, we have to give them beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| But is there a way around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Would that have to go through BCA if it didn't pass this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I mean, if you're talking about changing the qualifications currently in your beer ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1580)|
| 0:26:27| as a legislative body, you can change those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| You know, the only thing you can't do is deviate from state law because the state does preempt all liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| It does monitor the manner in which we issue beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| For instance, we can't deny someone a permit merely because the prevailing community says we don't want beer in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| So, but we can certainly, you know, when we drafted the beer ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| we made sure that we were in consonance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| State law is currently evolving in terms of liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| And if you're looking to have our policies more mirror the qualifications that the state requires of liquor licensees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| we can certainly look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| It's your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| As long as we're in comport with state law, we can pretty much do quite a bit of inventive legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Is that something we need to look into further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| I know that somebody told me here there was two or three applications coming up that we're going to have to go maybe to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| BZA or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Well, again, there's a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| If it's going before the BZA, they're looking for a variance of their property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| They're not getting a beer permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| That's probably what it is, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Nevertheless, any of these issues we can certainly research and get back with you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| It's always good to take a fresh look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| And, you know, again, it's an evolving body of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Your ordinance should certainly mirror that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Any other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| If not, we are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1674)|
| 0:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=1686)|

| 0:45:02| And I believe I stand here today because of Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| I'd like to read this letter that I've written to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| It was titled, My Mentor, My Friend, My Guardian Angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Mr. Boring ran with patience the race that was set before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| Jesus said, If any man serve me, let him follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| And where I am, there also my servant be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| I want to honor Mr. Boring today by being ready always to give an answer to every man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| that asks me a reason of hope that is in me with meekness and fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| First of all, I have hope because of what my Father in Heaven did for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| through the work that Jesus completed on the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Second, I have hope because God sends guardian angels to watch over us when we need them most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| As a 14-year-old, I needed a man in my life that lived what Jesus said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| It is more blessed to give than receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. Boring gave me a job in the cafeteria in 1970 and 71, as well as a summer job in 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| He would sign for me in detention hall and pay me to pick up trash on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| He gave to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| And that which he hath given will he pay him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| Thank God for the givers of this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| How many hundreds and thousands have been touched by my guardian angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Just when you think that you are just another number in the thousands of young men and women that Mr. Boring touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| you find out that you are special in the eyes of a great man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I ran into Mr. Boring around 1994 at the city county building where we both worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| I said to him, Mr. Boring, I know that you won't remember me, but I want to thank you for all that you did for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| He looked at me with that patented look and said, Braden, who could forget you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Twenty years after I had graduated, he knew who I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| I am more fortunate than most Central High School alumni in that I was able to sit down with Mr. Boring many times from 1994 to 2006 and just talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2819)|
| 0:47:09| He reminds me of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, in that he knows me personally and has touched my life personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| Rest, great bobcat, for your works follow you to your resting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Because you have touched so many, these works will multiply exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| Jesus said that he will reward you according to your works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I am a living testimony of one of those works, and I am humbled to have known such a guardian angel as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| And I'm Roy Braden, class of 1974, my mentor, my friend, and my guardian angel, Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2868)|
| 0:48:07| I know no one who has greater impact on the lives of young people in Fountain City than Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2887)|
| 0:48:22| He had a great impact on my life and through the beginning of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| But I'd just like to say appreciation to the commission for recognizing a great person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| And as Roy has said, he cared for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| He had to put up with a lot of scoundrels, but he still kept his faith and kept doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Mr. Chairman, you may not realize this, but I was in the principal's office a time or two when I was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| And, Mary, he treated me very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| He really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Scared to death when I walked in, but when you walked out, like, well, this guy, he's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| And I also want to say a word to you, Mary, that I played basketball with Danny, as you know, through all the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| And there's not a finer person on that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And just the way you brought him up, he never got in trouble, not just because his dad was the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| but you brought both of your children up so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| So that's a compliment to you and to Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And while I say that, don't you tell Danny that I admire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| But just what Roy has said, that sums up for a lot of students at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| I mean, he was there during those golden years there at Central High School there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| And so we want to bestow this to you from the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| We have two resolutions that we want to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3000)|
| 0:50:16| We have one person who has signed up to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| That is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Mr. Mays, if you will come to the podium or you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| If Jolie would be kind enough to patch me into the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| I got a copy of a deposition back recently I thought you all might want to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| This is a deposition of William Thomas Salter, your solid waste director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| As I've told you many times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| I allege that Mr. Salter knew that contaminated mulch had been sold to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| and he continued to tell county commission that everything was okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| and did not warn the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| I had evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We confronted Mr. Salter with evidence in questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Here is his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Question, so in March 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| you knew that product in the sales bins at Natural Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| had extremely high levels of fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Answer by Mr. Salter, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Question, 1,000 times higher than the limit of the EPA for fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| Answer, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Question, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Answer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| And you had the material pulled off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| How much of it was sold before it pulled off the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| Answer, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Question, did you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Did you inform the public that contaminated mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| had been sold to the public with fecal coliform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Did you inform the county commission that contaminated mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| with fecal coliform had been sold to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| We may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| There may have been some commissioners that we told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| Question, but you agreed with me earlier that you had told commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| that there was nothing wrong with the mulch, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Answer, well, after this incident, I consulted with Joel Albert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| Question, just answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| You told commissioners there was nothing wrong with the mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| after you had these lab tests ran in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Mr. Salter knew that the mulch at Natural Resources Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| was contaminated with fecal coliform 1,000 times over the regulatory limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| but continued to tell this county commission everything was fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and asked you to vote for a mediated settlement and forgive their debts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| By the way, Commissioner Briggs directly asked Mr. Salter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| if this mulch was contaminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| and he reported to him that it passed after these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| Also, this is not isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| We now know that this happened on three occasions that the mulch was tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| It failed directly from the retail bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Salter knew about it and told commission it was okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| despite the fact he knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| He also did nothing to warn the public who had purchased this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| The materials that were contaminated had exceedingly high levels of fecal coliform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| salmonella, E. coli, and molybdenum on these three various occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| which he now admits to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Now, as a citizen, I knew this had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| I have no choice as a citizen but to come forward and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| To be honest with you, I would be concerned I might be charged with something if I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| It seems like I'm charged with attorney's fees for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I was sued for slander by your solid waste director, but now he admits this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| I thought you all should know that I was telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I was oftentimes portrayed, in my opinion, by Mr. VandeVeit as being dishonest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| I wonder what Mr. VandeVeit has to say now that his employee admits this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| But more importantly, what about the constituents who voted you into those seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| whose children may have handled this, who planted food in this material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| What about the schools this material was donated to to go into playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| But the simple fact of the matter is I can find no legitimate excuse for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| to not have been told everything by one of your own officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I want to thank you for keeping us informed on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| And, you know, Frances, I hope that we're watching and Dean and everybody's watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| because I'm real anxious to see what we're going to do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| This has been going on and going on, and I know there's still litigation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| but I'm sure something needs to be done when it's all said and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| and everything's done legally and that's what we're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| But I appreciate you keeping us informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| It just really aggravates me, you know, people just out and out lie to you about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| and it's not just a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| We're talking public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Well, this was a similar behavior that I discovered, in my opinion, with the Hall's green waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3333)|
| 0:55:43| A few other commissioners don't know how that theft was originally came public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| as me and Commissioner Smith do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| Basically, an informant who had worked in the solid waste office contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| and told me that the Hall's green waste money was being stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| that the solid waste director had known about it for at least six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| and had not contacted the police, and that there was thousands of dollars being stolen from Hall's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| And I informed Commissioner Smith about this, the information I'd received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Me and Commissioner Smith went and got six months of the receipt books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| The informant told us that this has been happening for at least six months that they knew about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| because they had discussed it with Mr. Salter six months earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and he told them it wasn't enough money to worry about, there wasn't enough money stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| we don't need to call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Me and Commissioner Smith went and got the receipt books from Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| and compared it to the deposit records and we found about $20,000 in cash missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Now, of course, Diane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Mr. Mays, I'm going to ask you, if you would, you gave us this information at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| So I'm going to ask you to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Well, we got Mr. Salter to admit that he knew that the money was being stolen and didn't call the police now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| I have his deposition in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Question, how long have you known about the missing money before contacting law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Answer, a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I think we had a theft in December and I think we brought in law enforcement this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| I got the records he brought in law enforcement in June, right after the incident with Rodney Rocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Prior to the Rodney Rocket incident, none of these thefts were reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| But Mr. Salter admits to knowing about thefts as far back as the previous December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| which would mean he knew about the thefts for six months or some of the thefts without contacting the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| Mr. Mays, you have a litigation going on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| This is depositions, this is going to be in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| This is not a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I'm making you all aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I'm asking you, sir, to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Well, I'll wrap it up, but I'm making you all aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| A lot of the things I told you all have now been admitted in depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Just one last thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| You know, Dean, just for you all, you're all just being brought up to snuff on this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| and it seems though in the past a lot of this just wanted to be covered up and covered up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| but we're real anxious to see, you know, once the mayor has all the facts and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| what everybody can do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| So I appreciate you all's attendance to it and staying informed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| Brad, thank you for keeping us in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| But we're going to hear more about this, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| The initiative is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| We're going to have a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| I need to get some paperwork together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| So we'll come back into session at 2.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| So we'll have about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3496)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3519)|
| 0:59:09| I'd like to call this meeting back into session for our regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3558)|

| 0:59:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3569)|

| 0:59:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3575)|

| 0:59:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Our devotional today will be by Commissioner Mike Brown, followed by the pledge to the flag from Commissioner Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| I've invited today one of the ministers from Stock Creek Baptist Church to come and give us a very short devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| So, Reverend Benji Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| Thank you so much for allowing us to be here, most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| It doesn't matter who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| But what does matter is I'm from South Knoxville, born and bred, have lived here my whole life, have served here my whole life, continue to serve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3607)|
| 1:00:14| I've been at the same church for 11 years because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| It is wonderful to see you guys in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I've not got to be here, had a chance to do that, and to see you guys work and move and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And here's kind of the challenge, devotion, encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I want you to be encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| From a South Knoxvillian, you're prayed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| You're cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| You're loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| You're guiding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| You're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| You're the ones that make us move and work and the places that we live, you make us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I'm listening to all the conversation and the legacy that we have a chance as public servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| because that's what we have in common as a minister or as a commission member or as all these people that we've acknowledged today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3649)|
| 1:00:56| It's been wonderful to hear about these people's lives, legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| So I want to challenge something I heard last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| If I had 24 hours to live, if that was it, I was gone in 24 hours, how would I spend that last 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| How passionate am I and how much faith do I really have in what I say I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| Would I live the last 24 hours of my life serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| Would we as public servants do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Because that's our model of serving because we get that from God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| I see that it takes a lot of wisdom to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| It takes a lot of wisdom and faith, and that's what we pray, that you guys have wisdom and you have faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| because our ultimate example is God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| That's wisdom comes from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Intelligence comes from man, but wisdom comes from above and only from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Well, it looks like Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| So what did Jesus Christ do in his last 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Well, the Bible says that he was with his disciples and he said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| and this is my challenge to me and to encourage you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| His last 24 hours he was with his disciples and it says he had loved them to the fullest extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| and he wanted to show them in one final act of how to truly love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| And you would assume that it's the cross that he's going to, and he is going to the cross ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| but how he showed them ultimate love in the last hours of his life was he washed their feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3734)|
| 1:02:21| in humility, and if anyone wouldn't have to do that, it would be God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| God doesn't have to wash our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| We don't deserve God to wash our feet, so what does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| It takes ultimate humility, true servanthood, laying down his needs and his wants and his desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| laying all that aside to love unconditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| So I wonder in the last 24 hours of my life if I could love that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and lay aside all that I want and all I desire to truly serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| So as you serve this community that I live in, my challenge is to serve in wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| to serve as a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| This is not just an election here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| This is not an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| This is a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| This is who you are because it's that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| So I want to encourage you that we are praying for you guys to have wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Let me pray for us and challenge you to live that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| not because it's the last 24 hours, but because that's how you truly serve people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3796)|

| 1:03:58| Lord, there's so many pains and sufferings and so many things going on, God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| You know them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3842)|

| 1:05:13| Next, amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| We need to add Resolution 203 from the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3915)|

| 1:05:34| I withdraw my discussion on the alcohol in the 10-year plan, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3934)|

| 1:05:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Given our discussion on hillsides and the way that ended up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| I thought it would be best for us to defer this to a work session or to our monthly session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3951)|
| 1:05:58| whatever the Commission desires to continue the discussion, the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3958)|
| 1:06:03| So that would be, you know, whatever the Commission wishes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| That would be my desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| This item is going to be heard at our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Could we bring up and discuss a timetable then as to when we would have this workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| Because I think everyone wants to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| We'll talk about that during zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Yes, I need to pull 301 off of consent, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| 301 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| Also, I'd like to pull off of consent resolution number 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| Are there any other amendments or additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| If not, is, yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| I guess I'd just like to make a comment on 203, the one recently introduced by County Skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4009)|
| 1:06:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| It's not on consent, so we will be hearing it as a regular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4027)|

| 1:07:12| We have item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| Let me move from full commission to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Is that the discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| Is that the one we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| It's not numbered, only printed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| This is out of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| The discussion of the east sector plan, rather than being in full commission today, we'll discuss that in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4052)|
| 1:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Yes, that's Commissioner Wright's desires to discuss that during zonings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| So if that's an acceptable commission, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| I'd like to pull 404 off of consent only for an explanation that those watching at home could hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4069)|
| 1:07:59| So that motion will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| It will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4081)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner Burroughs, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Where is 301?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| Is that on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| No, it has been pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| So it will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| If not, Commissioner Brown, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Do I have a motion that we add what needs to be added and delete what needs to be deleted and deferred what needs to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| I'll move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| And there is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Clerk, drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| There are no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Well, I guess we can just go ahead and move on to the consent items because most of these are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| We do have line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| We need to approve those separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Line item transfers are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| We had thought of a way that we could make the consent items a bit more entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| We thought about making them into a poem or perhaps a rap, but we couldn't do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4145)|

| 1:14:41| An ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| amending chapter 2, article 10, division 6 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| to amend section 2-830 entitled Reduction in Workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4487)|

| 1:15:03| and established in section 2-838 previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4503)|

| 1:15:09| Motion has been made to second the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| I guess I was encouraged to hear from John Duncan in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4517)|
| 1:15:24| I'm just wondering, I mean this is just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| I really would like to hear from the clerk's office, property assessor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| and am I missing anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| Is that the trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Yeah, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| As to if they're in favor of this as written, I know I'm not touching the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| I know this is up to the executive staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| But I really would like for others to get behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| I don't see it as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| I mean, you know, as several of us have said, we need to work for our pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| I mean, if there's a special occasion where we can actually save money by, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| in dire times by cutting staff, you know, that will be an opportunity to incentivize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| and I guess by law you have to incentivize those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| But for us to deal with a sliver of county government and there's a lot more employees out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4579)|
| 1:16:29| So I guess I'll look to the law director and ask, can we, as part of this, say that we will send,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4589)|
| 1:16:38| since we are approving this, that we will send strongly encouraging words to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| to the fee officers encouraging them to embrace this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| Commissioner McKenzie, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| what you have here is essentially a change to your personnel policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| And traditionally the commission has done that through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| In terms of your request, that would be more appropriate by way of a separate resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| simply because a lot of these separate fee offices, if you look at our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| the charter defers to state law because they're empowered by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| So an ordinance of this application would be best to stand alone, a separate resolution of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4633)|
| 1:17:20| asking the other fee offices to essentially become part of a centralized personnel system would be most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4640)|
| 1:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Again, I'm going to renew my objections to this that I spoke on last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4657)|
| 1:17:47| I really feel like we need to have as many options at our disposal as possible if we are going to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4667)|
| 1:17:57| we say that we want to attract the best and the brightest to government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| Do we or do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| We say that often with teachers, too, that we want the best and the brightest teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| but we're not willing to have the best and the brightest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| And it looks like we're going the same way with our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Yes, we're responsible to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| We're responsible also to the people who work for us and who are also taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| I'm also a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| I feel like we need to not tie the hands of the Human Resources Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4709)|
| 1:18:38| I think Frances has mentioned her concerns about you never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4718)|
| 1:18:48| You know, we need to hire the best people that we can to work for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| And contrary to popular belief, a county job doesn't pay incredibly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| There aren't tremendous benefits with it or perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And to be competitive with the private sector, I think that we need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| I'm not at all suggesting that severance should be routine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| but I think it's a tool in the Human Resources Toolbox that needs to be there in case we do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| So, again, I represent the people in my district, the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| but I also feel like it's my responsibility to look out for the people who work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| So that's all that I have to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| I just had a question, and I think we brought this up at our work session last week, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| about the differences between, and we're talking about ordinance 11-1-102 now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| As opposed to resolution R-11-1-904, which I think is the same, is just about the same thing, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4799)|
| 1:20:11| And it's sort of taking a compromised position in between having nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| and having a handbook change because if there are circumstances that we can't foresee right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4816)|
| 1:20:26| where we would want to get severance payments, where it would be in the interest of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| it would be in the interest of the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| and it would be in the interest of the people who would receive the severance pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| is that we would lose our flexibility to do that by having it in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| because before we could do that, we would have to go through at least a two-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4842)|
| 1:20:47| or three-month process before we could change the ordinance to do what needed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| if we had some sort of economic crisis within the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Whereas the resolution 11-1-904 really says about the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| and I believe it was even with the presentation that the mayor made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| or his representatives made at our workshop meeting, the same thing would occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| but the mayor in consultation with the legislative body, which is the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| could change that with just passing a new resolution that would allow the mayor to take care of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| For that reason, I'm willing to listen to other arguments, but from the way I look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| I won't vote for the ordinance, but I would vote for the resolution saying the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| because I think it gives us more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| Mr. Jarrett, would you like to weigh in on that, the difference between the ordinance and the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| The only concern I have, Commissioners, is that your personnel policy is codified in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| and is created by ordinance, and you can't amend it via resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| So that's the process you've taken, and because the state actually requires you to file personnel policies with the clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| et cetera, that's the reason the ordinance is the vehicle by which you achieve this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| I was wondering, I don't see him back there now, is there anyone from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| Dean Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| I couldn't see him from where I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Just to what the mayor's recommendation is, whether we should do this by resolution or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| I found a strategic place to sit that I can be seen or not seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| No, thank you very much for the chance to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| As I mentioned last week, the mayor's goal is to have a very clear, concise, and uniform policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| that can be understood by the administration, the public, as well as those employees that are currently employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4962)|
| 1:22:50| and those coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| And so in his drafting of what is in both the resolution and the ordinance is trying to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| And so there will not be severance barring a uniformly applied optional early retirement plan that could be put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4978)|
| 1:23:10| if and only if the budget, number one, would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| And number two, that it was in a position that it would bring about real long-term savings by removing those employment lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| That's not to say that it would be put in place at every time, but if there was a chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| a time when this commission and the mayor faced revenue projections that would not meet demands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5004)|
| 1:23:31| that would be an option that would be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| So in terms of asking for an ordinance, the mayor has asked that the commission approve this by ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| simply so that it is in the code, it is part of the handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5020)|
| 1:23:46| The mayor has implemented this as an executive within the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| It's part of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| He's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| But in order for the commission to be engaged fully in it, it would require it to be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| If it's simply the whim of any administration, that whim can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And this would codify it and require a commission to be at the table in order to make adjustments to it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5042)|
| 1:24:10| If those were ever, you know, a future administration that wanted to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| it would have to come before you as a body and seek that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| This is a legal question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| If this is a resolution where they would have to come back to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| if the resolution said the same thing as an ordinance, then they would still have to come back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| The only difference is it wouldn't take two months, two or three months to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Because I think resolution carries enough weight that the executive branch has to act on resolutions passed by the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Well, a resolution is an express will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| An ordinance is a law of countywide effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Your code, Article 10, Section 10, is the personnel plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and all of the actions of the county personnel plan are codified in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| So this amends that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| And the only way to amend an ordinance is through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| I understand the expedience issue, but, again, the problem is you've already codified your personnel plan in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| And as a result, that's the only way it could be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Now, as you're aware, there is a provision within the charter for emergency ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| So in the event of some catastrophe, the mayor could request an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| and that waives the reading requirements and would give you an expedited ordinance that we could draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| So you have that fail-safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| But I certainly understand logically you would presume that, but because of the manner in which you've done it in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| if you deviate from that, a resolution would not essentially amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Well, thank you for your explanation, and thank you for yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I thought last week that we determined that we would contact the other, the fee officers, the elected officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5156)|
| 1:26:05| about coming under the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| It was brought up earlier, you know, why we do one without the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Of course, we can't do anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| That's just to be on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| But have we contacted all of them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| I have not contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Well, I think we have to pass through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| I think what the law director was saying is that within the resolution might be the place for us to add some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| that we need to contact the other fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| And once that comes up, 904, I think it is, gets passed, then we'll be in a position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| I hate to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Ms. Witt, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Would you mind, I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| Would you like to address this as far as your office is concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| I'll be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Sherry Witt, 5052 Dubwood Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| As far as I cannot speak for all of the fee officers, but I can say for my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| and I have been an employee in that office for some 20-something years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| and we've just never come across some of the things that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| And it's just one of those things that we have our own personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| We adhere to the county plan in most, in almost everything, but we do have some personal things in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| And that's what's worked all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| We've never, I cannot imagine how thick the hand that might be if we have to say don't, don't, don't on things that are obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5243)|
| 1:27:33| So that's where we stand as far as what the mayor is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| I understand that, and I respect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| And if there is a problem, then maybe that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| But, you know, it is, again, as the law director said, up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| I think that this is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| And Dean had said uniform, and that's exactly what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| This is not uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| This only affects a certain percentage of county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| I don't think it's right to treat some employees different from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| There are a lot of reasons that I object to this, but that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| And, you know, if we want to, if we don't want the best working for our taxpayers and working in government, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5298)|
| 1:28:32| But we need to be honest with ourselves about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| So I don't agree with this for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| But one of the big ones is that it's not applied uniformly to every county employee, and that's just simply not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5320)|
| 1:28:50| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Oh, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| Dr. Briggs, are you satisfied with the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| I agree with what you said about the lack of a little bit of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| You know, I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| And I think the law director, and I have read the county charter multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| especially in the last couple of years with everything that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| And I do recall now, just as the law director, you know, very astutely pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| that we do have the ability to pass emergency ordinances if some catastrophe occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| And I'm really satisfied with the explanation that Dean Rice gave, and, you know, particularly after the clarification with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5365)|
| 1:29:33| And just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| I guess if we pass this, we won't need 904, then, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| No, essentially we would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Also, this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| It does come back for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| So motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5397)|

| 1:30:21| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5421)|

| 1:30:28| Mr. Dillingham, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Doug Dillingham is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5432)|
| 1:30:49| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools Facilities and Construction Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Thanks for coming, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| I hate getting handed a contract that's worth $8.5 million over 20 years 30 minutes before we vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| but that's what happened to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| A couple of questions about the contract and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| We're going to be paying $425,000 a year for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| That's what the school system is paying to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| I'm not going to ask you these questions in public, but, I mean, it's brought before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| and so you're the only one I can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| The owner of the property says his property taxes can't go up for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| Is that what the contract calls for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| I'm sorry, Commissioner, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Let's go back to the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I guess the maintenance question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| We're renting a building at $420,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| and we're responsible for the roof and everything else, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| It's actually a lease purchase agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| so it will become the property of Knox County Schools at the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| In 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Is that common if you're going to take ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Is that common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| Most landlord tenants, I thought the landlord took care of the exterior need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| Well, generally speaking, it's been my experience that, yes, the landlord is basically responsible for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| but generally tenants pay CAM charges, which is a fee that they pay on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| Now, I would like to point out as well that the contract is for $425,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5544)|
| 1:32:31| but there is a grant agreement that the city of Knoxville will be giving to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| that is equal to $200,000 a year that will go toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| But we're still putting $425,000 a year of taxpayer dollars, whether it be from the city and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| And, Commissioner Enders, let me add to that, if the building burns down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| we still continue to pay that every year until the term of the contract is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5574)|
| 1:33:05| What's the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| I'd like to make a substitute motion to defer until February to review this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| The motion has been made and seconded to defer until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Has anyone, have we had any sort of appraisal done on the property on how much the property is actually worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5598)|
| 1:33:29| Knox County Schools has not had an appraisal done on it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| You know, because I think it's about eight, I added this up and may have brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| it's about $8.5 million we're going to be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| And we do get back over that period of time, if my math is correct, about $420,000 in taxes over that 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5619)|
| 1:33:50| But, you know, I don't know if we did an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| If we're going to be responsible for the building, the maintenance, the roof, and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| would it be better off just to buy the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| You know, it might entail taking on more debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| and this is something we would need to look at with the schools and the mayor's office and have some deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| I'm not saying whether this is the right or the wrong thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| We do lose a little bit in taxes if we purchase the building, but I don't know how much the building is worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| and if it's been, I think it's been for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| I think I've seen for sale signs out there maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| But that's just something I think that might be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I don't know if that was even discussed at the school board meetings or not when the school board approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| I know everyone wants to keep county debt down now by, you know, by leasing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and that sometimes is good and sometimes might not be good, but I just wonder how much the building is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| My concern is that, you know, we're handed a contract an hour before our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| and I understand this is not a consent item, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| I mean, this is not an educational consent item where we have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5690)|
| 1:34:57| Generally, I mean, they are normally put on educational consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| because the agreement you have with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| unless you feel there's something illegal about it or in the alternative there's no funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| then it normally goes through your consent agenda and is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Was that the intent of the school board on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| I believe that it was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| Mr. Oaks is shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Well, we should have him up here at the podium then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Mr. Oaks, if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| I'll give it back to you if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| Mr. Oaks, what was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| So your intent was this to be on the consent agenda for educational consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| It's my understanding that that was the intent of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| The reason this didn't make consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| or it's my understanding that the reason this didn't make consent agenda is we were late getting it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| and providing it to commission, so it had to be added after the agenda was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| And what was the vote on this building, on this lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| What was the vote of the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| I mean, this is a lot of responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5773)|
| 1:36:15| I can't understand that we didn't have enough to build enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| And I'm for the STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| By all means, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| But, you know, when I first got the phone call and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| we're going to build a STEM Academy, we're just going to kind of approach you about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| And they said it's going to cost $3 million to bring it up to standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| And we have $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| And then, or no, it was going to cost $4 million and we have $3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| Now it's costing $4 million and we only have $2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| So there's been a lot of change in the funding, the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| But I just, what was the vote of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| That was a board meeting that I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| So I don't remember specifically, but I think it was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| Because I've attended all the school board meetings, work sessions, and meetings since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| Did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| One question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Is the, or do they have the intent to have a legislative or educational consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| And do we have to put it on educational consent or can we defer it for 30 days or to February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| Well, the only reason you would, again, first we want to make sure that there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| a deferral would not corral us under hardship to the school board or we'd incur any additional penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| Your agreement with the school board is unless you can demonstrate that this is unfunded or in the alternative it's an illegal contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5857)|
| 1:37:44| it should have been on educational consent and it should have been passed by the commission by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| And that's as a result of the agreement with the school board, the negotiated settlement with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| But you also have the school superintendent here as well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| Dr. McIntyre, is this in the current capital budget or the current school budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5876)|
| 1:38:05| Commissioner, we have Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| We have identified the funding within our budget to, within the current fiscal year in order to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| Obviously, we'll have to make a commitment to it over the long term in order to fund the out years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| But, yeah, we intend to certainly, the board has had a great amount of discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| and we feel this is an important part of our future and an important part of our strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| and we're prepared to ensure that we have the funding to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| Well, I guess based on the legality of it being funded through the current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| I had to pull my motion for 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| I'm disappointed in the contract, but I don't know that with that court agreement, I don't know that we can win that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| So I've been holding my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| So does the second wish to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Can you explain why he has to, why we can't do it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Because for it not to be on educational consent, it has to be either illegal or it has to be unfunded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| and it's neither of the two, it's just a bad lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| So if we wanted to vote against it, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Unless it meets the criteria, this should, normally this, if the timing was different, we had more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| educational consent calendar and would not be pulled unless it was illegal or unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| And Dr. McIntyre has asserted that there is funding and it is a legal contract, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5973)|
| 1:39:42| Dr. McIntyre, I'm not happy with this one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| I think this is, I mean, as he said, it's $8.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| We could have built an elementary school for $8.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| The way that this whole thing seems to be on fast track, I wish that you all could have got a hold of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| and talked to us, but you all act like we've got all the money in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| And the taxpayers can just fund you whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| It puts us in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| Point of order, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| I don't know if who has to, have you acknowledged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| No, I have not, but I was giving them a little leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| You're asking for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I'm the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| I'd ask him if he was going to withdraw his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| You know, I like construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| I like things like this, but I just, as a citizen, as a commissioner, I just don't appreciate how this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6032)|
| 1:40:42| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| We continually question us not being able to pick and choose the education, the department, the school board's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6049)|
| 1:41:01| We can't do it, but we continually try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| I don't think that substitute motion was valid, so the second shouldn't even have to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| It was not a valid motion because we cannot, by agreed order, mess in the school board's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6071)|
| 1:41:21| We can get mad all we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| We can complain, but at the end of the day, this passed 9-0 by the same people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6083)|
| 1:41:37| So, you know, we've dealt a lot with issues, again, that we don't really have any power to vote up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6097)|
| 1:41:46| but for county taxpayers, this facility is costing us roughly $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6106)|
| 1:41:55| Now, we love to pull in the city when it's convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Yeah, city residents are paying, but we kind of pull in when the city is paying $4 million as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6120)|
| 1:42:08| At the end of the day, we're getting a high school, a STEM academy, for $4 million of taxpayer money over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6128)|
| 1:42:20| If Austin-East Powell, Carnes had a roof problem, we're going to take care of that, just like this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| Those buildings cost more than $4 million, and in today's money, they cost a bunch more than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| So, we're getting a facility that's going to house our students from all over this county for a $4 million county taxpayer tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6155)|
| 1:42:47| I say congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| They have people that deal with their contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| We have to trust that their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| You know, their track record is pretty darn good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| There hasn't been a lot of lawsuits as a result of improper contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| so we have to assume while we did get this at the last minute, as a courtesy, that it's a good contract, that it's a valid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6186)|
| 1:43:15| If it's not, we'll, you know, we have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| But to try to delay this additional months is bordering on the end of not being able to start school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6199)|
| 1:43:28| They have plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| Their plans are in place to start their school in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| We can't continually delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| I'm extremely excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| This is going to be a boom for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| When I look at Hume, Fogg, Martin Luther King Academy in Nashville, those are extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| When you look at the top of the statewide schools, they're always up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| These are downtown schools, schools in impoverished neighborhoods that are succeeding, that are drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| They're the true magnets that are drawing from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| They have waiting lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| People are getting excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Your constituents from Districts 1 through 9 are going to get excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| You know, people ask me, how can you be for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| It's going to adversely affect the makeup of the top level of your class at Austin East, in my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| It may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| But we're going to give some kids a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| They're going to have some extremely challenging subjects and subject matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| And they're going to be able to interact with kids from all different walks, from rural to urban to rich to poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| to get together, solve problems, learn collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| I'm excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| And, again, as far as the details of it, I think we need to, I'll say it again, stay in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| We have a tendency to want to dabble in school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I don't think it's going to work out well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I guess my original thoughts or questions have been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Educational consent sort of takes it off the table, whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| But I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I mean, I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I regret we got the contract so late, but I like what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| I was scared here a few weeks ago when it was price tag went from four to five to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| That scared me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| I think Greater Schools Partnership had to get involved, didn't they, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| And I appreciate their buzz, Thomas and those guys stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6333)|
| 1:45:38| The city's commitment, 200,000 for 20 years, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6338)|
| 1:45:47| Yes, Commissioner, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Okay, so that's four million if I'm doing my math right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I would think if this were going in Halls or Powell or Carnes or Hardin Valley or South Knoxville or Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| the city wouldn't be put a penny in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| I think that's a pretty good deal for the Knox County school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| and the Knox County taxpayer that the city is willing to step up and put that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| which they certainly don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| They're pretty good partners in education anyway, give us more of that sales tax than they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| So I'm very proud the city is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| And to me, it's like this midway a few weeks ago, I'm sort of an anti-sprawl person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| I'd rather see it downtown in an existing building and create more economic activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6382)|
| 1:46:31| just more people bring them downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| On a personal basis, I went to a downtown school and it was exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| I went to movies and did things after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| We had football teams too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| I don't guess this one's going to have one initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| But I think that's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| On another personal basis, I worked in this building about 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| and never thought of it as a school, but I think it would be a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| And my only regret is that we didn't get the contract a little earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| but I think it will be a great project and I'm glad that hopefully it will move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| and I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Just to say I appreciate that and I apologize for the timing of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| That is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| But also I want to make sure the Commission understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| that we're also trying to be very cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| and really use the resources of the taxpayers very wisely in this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| In fact, that's part of why we really pushed off this decision for another month or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| to really step back and to make sure that the L&N Station building and campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| was really the best option for our school district and for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| And as Mr. Shouse has noted, there's an investment on the part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| There's a commitment on the part of the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| to raise some private funds to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| We're pursuing historic preservation tax credits that would be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| at the L&N Station building and would not be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| at any of the other options that we've potentially looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| And so in addition to that, there's about $2 million available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| from the Race to the Top funding to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| So in terms of the investment that we're making on the part of Knox County Schools resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6488)|
| 1:48:13| there's also a great investment on the part of other outside entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| state entities, and others to really support what I think is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| a very high quality education in the STEM disciplines for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| and an important part of our achieving our really ambitious agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| and our strategic plan of excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Let me echo everyone else's concerns about the fact that we're just receiving this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| I had not really prepared anything to say for or against the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| because I didn't know it would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| In fact, I asked several times over the last week the status of this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| As I stated earlier, I've attended all the school board meetings since October, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| This particular one elicited a lot of conversation among those members of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6545)|
| 1:49:13| Before I get into some of their comments, let me say something about the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| that the school board and the county commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| It's true they're involved in the education of students in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6565)|
| 1:49:30| capital funds associated with pursuing that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| But to say that we can't sit here and discuss it in commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| when we have to come up with the dollars from the citizens of Knox County, I do not agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6578)|
| 1:49:47| We have a perfect right to discuss where money comes from and where money goes here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| Something that Commissioner McKenzie pointed to just a second ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| was about the students that are going to attend this academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| It has nothing to do whether they're smart, they're impoverished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| they're from the county or they're from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| It's each existing high school right now, based on the percentage of their head count in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6612)|
| 1:50:22| will have that many seats lotteried to them and the interested parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| for example at Gibbs High School or Carter High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| will have the opportunity to enter their child's name in a lottery in that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6633)|
| 1:50:41| to fill those seats as freshman or sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6641)|
| 1:50:45| It's a true cross-section of the student body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6645)|
| 1:50:51| It does not look at anything else the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6651)|
| 1:50:58| So to say that this will be a smart school, that may not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6658)|
| 1:51:04| It's going to be a true representative cross-section of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| but of parents that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| So I guess what that then brings me to think is that if you have interested parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| that are focused on their child's progress and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| you'll have a better student body at the STEM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| but then I look back at the schools identified in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| that are having trouble meeting their standards right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| so we're skimming the interested, focused kids off of those high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| and then moving them to the STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| Now, Gibbs has just been identified as a student population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| where if there is a parental request and a parent provides transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| they can leave Gibbs High School and go to another school of their choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| if they're accepted and if it's a school that's accepting transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I'm not saying the STEM is bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| but I think the process by which we're getting there has some flaws in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| While I'm at Gibbs High School, a part of the funding for this particular program at the L&N| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6737)|
| 1:52:23| pushes off for a repair at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| To say it's not costing other existing schools in Knox County something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6746)|
| 1:52:33| and that's just the one thing I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| there are other funded programs giving up a little bit here and a little bit there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| to come up with the upfront money to get this L&N building renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6761)|
| 1:52:49| I believe that I also heard somewhere in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| that all of the buildings not being renovated in this particular go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| There may be other renovations expenses yet to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| it being that there are only going to be freshmen and sophomores there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| The school is going to have to grow out to juniors and seniors also being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| So that for me, if we look, we the funding body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| we look at the difference between students sitting in their current existing high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6796)|
| 1:53:25| and then going and adding whatever these millions of dollars are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| to get them into a downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6809)|
| 1:53:37| There's an expense to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Is that $1,000 a child additional from them being at Austin East or Gibbs or Carter or Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6822)|
| 1:53:50| There will be Farragut kids there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| We're offering standard, normal, good education for all kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| Well, to get them out of their current high school and get them into a STEM school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| it's going to have a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| I think we were doing pretty good where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| And if this were something we would vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| because of the reasons that I've identified, I would vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6862)|
| 1:54:28| I believe we just not had a time enough to look and hear and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6868)|
| 1:54:36| And I believe that the school board found itself in that same position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| when this proposal was presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Dr. Lindsay, before you got here, we did something over at McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| Over at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| How is this different from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| And I know that's underutilized over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| Could we not have put that over at that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So the concept that we're talking about is in our five-year strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| that the board approved and we've talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| The idea is for a high-quality, stand-alone magnet STEM academy high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| And that would be really our first magnet school that is a pure magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| that does not have its own geographic base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6922)|
| 1:55:24| but that draws students from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| Well, why does it have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I mean, Austin East, where we did the magnet school, it's underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Why does it have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Well, again, I think the idea is that there is a cadre of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| for whom this will be an area of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| and an area where they can get a great education in the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| I think it leverages lots of partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| The University of Tennessee is a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Oak Ridge Associated Universities are a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| And the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| There's about $2 million in Race to the Top resources that are going toward this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| And those resources are specifically allocated for a STEM academy high school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| Well, you know, UT will come to Austin East and so will the other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| Oak Ridge, they'll come over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| How many millions did we spend on Austin East to get it renovated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| Well, Austin East, their magnet component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| there's a couple different magnet components to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| but the one that was a large focus of the facility was performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6993)|
| 1:56:38| So there's lots of dance studios and auditorium and a performing arts auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=6998)|
| 1:56:43| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| So the focus on the facility at Austin East was really around the performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| And how many students do you anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| About 200 per class, about 800 kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| About 800, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I guess me, like the rest of them that have spoken so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| are kind of upset that we haven't had time to look this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7027)|
| 1:57:12| But reading through it while the talking has been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| one thing that stands out to me on Page 7, 12.6 under Miscellaneous, is time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| And I think this is probably one of the reasons why this is before us today rather than next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| because if they're going to get it ready for school in August, they've got to get started on it yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| So, you know, this is one of the things I think you have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| we don't exactly live in a totally black or totally white world today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| Sometimes you've got to have some gray area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| and I think this may be one of those where we, you know, need to say, okay, looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7065)|
| 1:57:54| Just so Commission knows, we had a, you all had approved a policy that anything that went past the deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| would need to call and ask the Chair to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| I believe Mr. Oaks called me on Friday and said it was necessary to get this on the agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| I agreed to put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| And so that's the process that we went through to get it on here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| Ms. Burwells, did you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| Yes, I just wanted to mention that we have a magnet honors academy for the elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7095)|
| 1:58:24| but there is no honors middle school or honors high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| which is a problem, in my opinion, for the kids who come out of the honors elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| A lot of them are going into private education because they come out ahead of other sixth graders going into middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7115)|
| 1:58:46| So this doesn't solve the problem of the honors middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| and I hope that that's something that the school board will tackle really soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| But I'm glad that this is in place for the kids who are on that honors track starting in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7135)|
| 1:59:04| This will be a good thing, and I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| And the school board has my complete support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Burwells, what you just spoke to, though, is not being solved by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| This is not an honors high school where you get in on your tract or your merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| or your position coming from elementary school or middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| This is entirely by lottery of all the high schools, rising juniors and seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| rising freshmen and sophomore students in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| Anyone that applies will be pulled from a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| It has nothing to do with being an honors school for honors kids that are in one through five right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7190)|
| 1:59:58| I guess my feeling on that is that it takes the parent to get the process started for a child to even get into the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7198)|
| 2:00:09| And if a parent has a high-achieving child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| they're going to recognize the opportunities that are going to be available at this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| and will be anxious to have their child take part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| So, no, there may not be a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Is there a testing to get in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| I know at the elementary school there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| But if there's not testing to get in, if it's strictly by lottery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| still the high-achieving students whose parents are engaged in their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| and want them to have the advantage of the STEM high school will make sure that their kids are on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| So, no, it may not be strictly a continuation of the honors track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| but I think it makes something available for parents of high-achieving students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| to send their kids someplace different than just the regular Knox County high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| Not that there's anything wrong with the regular Knox County high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| I'm zoned for Fulton, and I think Fulton is doing an exceptional job educating our community's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7268)|
| 2:01:16| They're amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| But this gives students another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| And for parents who are engaged in their children's education and want this for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| it's there and it's available, and I think that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| And I would respond by saying I don't know that we need this greater opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| at more than $1,000 a head for these kids to get something there which they can get at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| I agree with you about Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| And I would also offer to you that 100 percent of the population of Gibbs High School parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| because they may want to get away from Gibbs because of its new category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| if 100 percent of them put their kid's name in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| then it doesn't matter about being high-performing or achieving kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Everyone that is there, back to your original point, this is not an honors school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| It's just another average school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Dean, can you come to the podium real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| You know, Dean, as you're coming to the podium, I know the mayor is trying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| one of the big things that you're all trying to do is cut and get our debt down and where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| And it seems like, you know, every time we do something, we may be spinning our wheels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| and this just puts you back another $425,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| You know, $8.5 million total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| Has the mayor weighed in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| How big a buy-in does this put you guys in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| We're not seeing the final numbers on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| but it's my understanding that a good portion of this funding for the school overall will come from a federal grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| and then another portion is being raised privately through the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Now, the actual burden that comes down to the tax dollars at the county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| I've not talked with the superintendent in terms of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| or if it would be above and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| and that certainly would be something to be addressed in this coming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| But I can't speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| I haven't seen the documents, and I don't know the details of what you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| And speaking about the federal dollars, is it going to be funded one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7400)|
| 2:03:27| Can you explain how much of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Yes, it's a $2 million grant over two years, this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| I guess, Commissioner, the way I look at this is as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| We have a budget that's appropriated by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7418)|
| 2:03:44| and the school board looks to use those dollars as wisely and efficiently as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| to get the best outcomes for our students that we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| And we believe that this investment is a good one for the future of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| that having a rigorous, high-quality STEM magnet high school in Knox County is a good thing for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7437)|
| 2:04:05| You know, a high-quality STEM education does, for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| really create some habits of learning and cognition and thinking for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| that are going to put them in good stead no matter what they're going to do in their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| And we think this is a great opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| And I think part of the reason that we're really interested in this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7458)|
| 2:04:24| is because of the wonderful regional assets that we have in the STEM disciplines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| that we have the premier laboratory in the nation in our midst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| that we have the flagship university for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| research university for the state of Tennessee, right here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| that we have some great technology companies and engineering companies in our midst that we can benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7482)|
| 2:04:48| And if we leverage all those partnerships, which we fully intend to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| we think this can be an outstanding opportunity for 800 students in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| that can really provide a terrific education for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| And I think the other concept that's important to note here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| is that there's this notion in the Race to the Top strategy for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7505)|
| 2:05:09| also of a STEM hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| And a STEM hub is not just a school, but a partnership among entities in a region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| that will really take a leadership role in STEM education for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| And, you know, that the university will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| that the laboratory will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| that Knox County Schools will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| and there's additional funding for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| But this is really about opportunities for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| And as you know, having a high-quality STEM education is great for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| in terms of their learning and their habits of thinking for the future and problem-solving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| but it's also great for their possibilities in terms of career opportunities for the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| So we think it's a great investment of the resources that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| and we're trying to cobble together the various funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| to ensure that as the taxpayers invest in this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| that there are lots of other entities that are supporting it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| One last thing, Mr. Chairman, is just, you know, we had a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| I would have liked to have talked like other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| and I know we had stuff – we had a workshop today at lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| where for something this important and this amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| I would have come another 34 to 35 minutes and been there if we'd said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| hey, let's be there at 10, 30, 11 o'clock, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| We've got something major that we need to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| You know, I think our hearts are in the right place as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| but we want to be well-informed in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| So, you know, we want to make educated votes, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| I did have a couple of questions also, and I agree totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| In my previous life, I always wondered why we didn't have a greater connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| to the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| It was just, you know, there were some minor attempts, I guess, at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| but there was always – it was like the types of assets that were available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7615)|
| 2:07:02| I mean, we just didn't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| So this is a – you know, I can see this as being potentially a very good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| and I haven't really studied the issue so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| It's gotten a lot of press and, of course, here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| I suppose that, you know, some of the things that I read about in the paper were that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| although the Board of Education had a unanimous vote on it, there was a lot of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| and I was wondering if I could ask you a question or two about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| I guess, especially as, like, being a building-level guy like I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7653)|
| 2:07:37| I was always – when you're in the school and you're in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| you're kind of worried about you getting less if somebody else is getting some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| if you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7665)|
| 2:07:46| I mean, there's an X amount of dollars to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| So in terms of your budget and your commitment to each of those individual high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| they're going to have a few students taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| I mean, how are you assuring your teachers there that, hey, we're not taking away from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| You're still going to have your programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| You're still going to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7685)|
| 2:08:06| You're going to have excellence in your schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| What are you saying to those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Well, you know, I think part of the funding strategy is that some dollars will follow the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| As students come from other high schools to this high school at the L&N Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| the STEM Academy High School, that some of those dollars will follow those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| But I guess what I'm saying to folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| and I'm going out to Farragut High School in a couple days to talk to the faculty out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| I know there's some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| But we've got some great STEM programs in some of our schools already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| You know, at Farragut High School, at Hardin Valley Academy, at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| We've got some great STEM-related programs already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| And this is not intended to take away from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| It's not intended to limit the opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| It's really intended to enhance everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| So, for example, you know, we just got this wonderful grant from UT Battelle that was announced on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| for distance education, for distance learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| And what that is, is they're going to equip us with the technology to be able to provide video conferencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| and provide instruction to a lot of our kids in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| So you might have an advanced physics course that's taught at the STEM Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| that we're going to be able to have students in, you know, all of our other 13 high schools take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| So we're really looking to make sure that it doesn't limit opportunities for kids, that it really enhances them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| And this notion of the STEM hub is exactly supposed to be meant to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| It's meant to, you know, ensure collaboration, ensure synergies among some of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| and institutions and universities and school districts in this area to ensure that we're all working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| to make sure that our kids can get a great education in the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| And I was talking to a group of scientists the other day, and I said, you know, when it comes to STEM education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| we think we can have more mass and more energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| We think we can break the laws of physics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| And I think it can be more than the sum of its parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| Okay. And then my other question, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| That's, I'm sure, helpful to the people that are in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7800)|
| 2:10:03| and are worried about their programs and their funding levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7803)|
| 2:10:08| And you mentioned the federal funds and the $2 million race to the top funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| Was that tied down to this project per se, like you're not getting it unless you build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7813)|
| 2:10:20| It is specifically earmarked, and I know earmarked is kind of a dirty word these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7820)|
| 2:10:25| but it's specifically allocated for a STEM high school or a STEM school in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| And if we don't use it for that, it will not get used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| No other lights. The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| He withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| Did you withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| Okay. He's going to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Okay. So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| Okay. Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| We'll gather together here about 340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7864)|
| 2:11:22| There have been several questions asked about when we start zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| Zonings are at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| We had 5 o'clock last time because it was a Friday, and we had moved it up just so we could accommodate everyone's schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7892)|
| 2:11:40| So that was kind of an anomaly and not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| The norm is 6 o'clock, and that's when we have zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| Happy hours in 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| Just keeping everyone informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Who's doing the karaoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7911)|
| 2:11:52| Karaoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7912)|
| 2:11:55| Okay. Commissioners, if you'll take your seats, let's get underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7915)|
| 2:12:03| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| On page 2, this is Resolution 301,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| regarding the distribution of proceeds from property forfeited as a result of criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Someone had asked that this be taken off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| Yes, Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| When I read this, it said that the proceeds from the property forfeited go to the Sheriff's Department, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7953)|
| 2:12:43| Carlton Bryant with the Knox County Sheriff's Office, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7968)|
| 2:12:49| And about how much per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7969)|
| 2:12:55| How much was it last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| We had none last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| This is a provision in the statute wherein the legislators have recognized that taking both the proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7979)|
| 2:13:07| and conveyances and anything else associated with criminal activity helps deter crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7987)|
| 2:13:14| In the past, in order to follow this statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7994)|
| 2:13:19| General Nichols would have to go to Chancery Court, get the property forfeited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| and it would go to the state of Tennessee and no one would benefit locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| It really wasn't financially wise to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| There's a provision in the statute that allows you all to pass either a resolution or an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| whereby that money comes from the state back to the county general fund earmarked for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8015)|
| 2:13:45| It's part of a judicial proceeding and the judge would, of course, have to make a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| as to whether or not the property is indeed forfeitable and then how it needs to be distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| General Nichols would be compensated for time under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| But we've seized a large number of vehicles for drug-related activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| We've seized cash for drug activity and for DUI stuff, but this broadens what we're able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8046)|
| 2:14:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| So I'm wondering how much that's been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| We haven't had any in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| So in the past it's all gone to the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| We've done none of this type of seizing and forfeiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| So this is something that's entirely new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Do you have, can you speculate as to how much it might possibly be based on, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Because I'm just wondering how much this is going to be because as we're saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| it's all going to go straight to the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| Well, are we talking, you know, a couple thousand dollars a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| Are we talking a couple hundred thousand, a couple million, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| and how is that going to impact the sheriff's budget and do we need to offset that somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| Can we get better coffee up here for that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| I mean, you know, I guess I'm looking for a plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8100)|
| 2:15:05| Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8105)|
| 2:15:08| If I could while he's conferring, it would be, let's say somebody bought a house as a result of their criminal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8108)|
| 2:15:14| and the judge offered it forfeited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| It's kind of like the IRS taking everything that was gained from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| and then normally that would go back to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| Now this is a provision in state law that allows it to come back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8125)|
| 2:15:26| But there's no way to determine what it's going to be on a year-to-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| So can I ask then for after this has been in place for a year that you come report back to us how much the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8130)|
| 2:15:37| how much you collected and then what you used it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| So that we can determine at that time if we need to make adjustments to the sheriff's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| or as a result of how much you get or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8153)|
| 2:15:54| I find this is all done in an open court and it's all public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8154)|
| 2:15:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| So, but I would be more than happy to report back next January as to how we've.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| Well, I would love to see how well this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| and how much we're able to recover for local law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| And I was getting a soft drink when you first spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| Your name is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8186)|
| 2:16:27| My name is Carlton Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8187)|
| 2:16:28| I'm one of the attorneys on staff with Sheriff Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| I didn't completely understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| I wanted to make sure your last name was not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Oh, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| It's Bryant, B-R-Y-A-N-T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8205)|
| 2:16:46| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8208)|
| 2:16:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| On page 3, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| approving a contract with Goodwill Industries Knoxville to provide comprehensive recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| and reuse services at the Knoxville Convenience Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| This is resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8226)|
| 2:17:08| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| And, Commissioner Brown, I believe you had asked this to be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| The reason that I asked for it to be pulled off was because I would like for the folks who are watching at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| who maybe didn't see the workshop last week to understand what this program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8241)|
| 2:17:26| We've had a couple of times at various convenience centers a one-day deal where they could bring these items in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8246)|
| 2:17:37| But we understand this now, Mr. Vanderveet, that this can be done on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| And could you elaborate again what types of items can be brought in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8263)|
| 2:17:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I'd be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| We've had an arrangement with Goodwill at three centers, Halls, Dutchtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| and John Sevier for five years to assist with recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| This is an extension of that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| It's going to expand the scope of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| They are going to have collection centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| just general collection centers for any item of value that people might want to bring in at all three centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| And they're also going to expand their services at all three centers to include e-waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| People typically think of computers, but e-waste is basically anything with a power cord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| and that's everything from a waffle iron to an old computer monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| It means a lot to us because those are big, bulky, and heavy items that tend otherwise to fill up compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| and cost the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8312)|
| 2:18:34| This way we're able to divert them from the waste stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| Goodwill is able to resell those items and support the work that they do, and everybody comes out a winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8317)|
| 2:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| I've had two or three questions asked from my constituents about this since the last big one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8325)|
| 2:18:52| a month or so ago down on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8332)|
| 2:18:56| And I think, as I said, that's why I wanted to be sure we get this information out to all of the Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8336)|
| 2:19:03| They know they have a place to take this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| And continuing on Commissioner Brown's track, this is currently at three sites or three recycling centers, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8349)|
| 2:19:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| Or three convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| Three convenience centers, Halls, Dutchtown, and John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| Is there any thought to expanding it to other convenience centers that now have space more than what they had in years gone by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8364)|
| 2:19:33| Over time, yes, sir, we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| It's a little function of budget to some extent, but over time we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| And in the interim, as Commissioner Brown alluded to, just the single day events where we collect e-waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8379)|
| 2:19:45| particularly computers these days, everybody is on their fourth or fifth or sixth generation of home computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8385)|
| 2:19:52| Those have been very successful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| So if there's a center in particular that anybody would like for us to do an e-waste event at, we'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8394)|
| 2:20:00| We can do a one-day event and promote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| And that might serve in the near term until we're able to expand the services beyond these three centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| At these three centers for the e-waste, is it stored or is it out in the open during the week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8410)|
| 2:20:18| What's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| Goodwill is responsible for the handling of it, but it's typically stored inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| For instance, at Dutch Town, they have a small building on site and they just pack everything in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| and then they haul it to their main center as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8430)|
| 2:20:35| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| Commissioner Brown, did you, or Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8441)|
| 2:20:42| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| On page four, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| requesting that the Knox County Law Director advise the Knox County Commission on a monthly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| as to the status of the TBI investigation of former Knox County trustee employee, John Hahn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| and the status of efforts to recover public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| alleged to have been misappropriated by and or improperly paid to John Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| I'm going to make a motion that we approve with a slight amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| and that is that we ask our Law Director to send a copy or a letter to our Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| and to our Finance Director asking them to keep us advised on a monthly basis of any change in the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8480)|
| 2:21:26| So I'll make a motion that we approve with that slight amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| No opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8494)|
| 2:21:35| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8495)|
| 2:21:36| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8496)|
| 2:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8497)|
| 2:21:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8498)|
| 2:21:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| I need to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| She's going to read number 904, but I think we said that we don't need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| but we need to read it anyway and formally do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| Resolution 904 on page four, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| requesting that Knox County Mayor amend the Knox County Employee Handbook to add affection to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| Knox County from remitting severance payments to county employees for work not performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8521)|
| 2:22:09| Make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| I guess you have to withdraw, don't you, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| I'll make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| I would like somehow us to get some kind of correspondence out to the fee offices asking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8537)|
| 2:22:26| So I know the law director said the ordinance wasn't necessarily the proper place for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8546)|
| 2:22:32| but I still would like to get that out somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| I don't know if we can disempower the chair to do something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8555)|
| 2:22:41| Yes, that would be most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-jan-2410-preview?start=8561)|
