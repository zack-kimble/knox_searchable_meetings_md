| 0:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Mr. Law Director, let's swear in those people that plan to testify today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| Will everyone present who intends to testify before this board please stand, raise your right hand, and be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you'll give before this body today is the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Mr. Chairman, they have been so sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Our first application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Knox County, Three Ridges Golf Course, 6101 Wise Springs Road for our own premises, formerly Four Star Golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=145)|
| 0:02:37| Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Doug Patel, Senior Director of Parks and Recreation, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| Mr. Patel, there's an application here submitted by you through your entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Would you please explain to the board how this came to fruition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Quick history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Obviously, Knox County has owned Three Ridges Golf Course for about the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| It's been under contract management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| And through discussions both with the mayor's office, my department, and our current greens committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| the decision has been made and approved by the county commission to have this a county run facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| Again, through conversations with the administration and both with our greens committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| and the new golf board, discussion about whether to continue on with the current beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| and sale of beer on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Again, in discussions and research with this and looking at the fact that we've had 15 years of operation up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| with no problems, it's obviously an important part of the golf business and a part of what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| The decision was made, again, by the greens or the golf board to continue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| And so that's why we're here today to apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| Now, I understand there's a concession on the course itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Yes, sir, at current time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Tennessee Code Section 714501 essentially requires that any time a county has a concession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=230)|
| 0:03:57| it affords the Division of Blind Services the opportunity to take over that concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Was that offer tendered to the Division of Blind Services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| And what was their response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Their response was they're not interested in that particular type of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| As I understand it, that goes to purchasing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| And I know U-Hold here is here if there's any further questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| What is the status of the employees currently employed at the course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| All the employees there will be rolled over into the county system as of January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Thereby meaning they'll become county employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| Has anyone out there completed server training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| All the current employees that are serving have already gone through the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Have criminal background checks been conducted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| Those were conducted by the previous operator as well as we will continue those practices in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| How long was the previous license in effect, to your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| Since the course opened, I believe a little over 15 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| The sale of alcoholic beverages or I should say beer specifically and only, would that be on-premises or off-premises or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| On-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| That does include the golf course itself as indicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| And your department will henceforth regulate and otherwise control this course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations and do you and your employees agree to conduct yourselves in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=310)|
| 0:05:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| You've already testified earlier that you've had server training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| State Department of Revenue requires licensure or at least a permit or documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Have you approached the State Department of Revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Yes, sir, and we do have that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| To whom was that issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Three Ridges Golf Course for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I have no further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Thank you, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner Hamming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Doug, if this is approved and you're entering into the contracts with the beer companies, will you have a contract with the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| or would you just go out and buy it wholesale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| How will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I believe that will be a contract basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Again, we're working through purchasing to make sure all that's done appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Will you have just one supplier or will you be able to take product from each of these suppliers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| I believe we'll be able to do, I think there's only actually two in town anyway, but I think we will be able to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| You're talking about the Miller people and the Budweiser people, Eagle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| So, you will put that up for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I spoke with Mr. Lockett about that and since they're the only two distributors and we carry Miller and Bud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=379)|
| 0:06:30| we're just going to do a negotiated contract with both of those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| When you're talking with them, ask about things such as signage, which I'm sure you will, but I mean all of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| I'm sure you're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Secondly, revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| How much revenue do you expect us to get from this, Doug, and where will this extra revenue go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| Before you do that, Commissioner, I hate to interrupt, but you will need to give your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| There.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Hugh Holt, Deputy Director of Finance, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Okay, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| The revenue will come as all the revenues for the golf course is going to stay at Three Ridges to both pay all the operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| bills as well as go into funds to do improvements there, replace equipment, do capital replacements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| So, all that is designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| The estimation we had was around $25,000 of revenue from direct sales and potentially another $25,000 from tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=432)|
| 0:07:19| operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| That certainly figured into our decision about continuing this service, that it is probably a total of around $50,000 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| UK, you had approached me and said that you were concerned that this may not be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| So, I was just wondering your thoughts on this as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Commissioner, we go back a long ways on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| Back as far as 1840, I have a deed when Knox County first purchased that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=465)|
| 0:07:58| We've only had a beer business tax July the 14th of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| It's the first time it was up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| The law director at that time was Richard Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=488)|
| 0:08:18| And he told them then that his only way they could put beer up there is have it leased out, not put it in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| County's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| They couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| So, Mr. Law Director, I know you've sent out a memo, but I just wanted for the record to have that on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=507)|

| 0:08:47| Health Department, any concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| With the exception of, I just want to ask the gentleman, you said that this is just a manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=529)|
| 0:08:58| You speak into the mic, so as best you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| This is just a manager changeover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| Well, again, it was a contracted operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| Knox County is now operating the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| But all the current staff is going to move to be Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| And this was, was it called Three Ridges Golf Course before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=559)|

| 0:09:22| Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| I have a background check on the general manager, Mark Allen Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Is he going to be the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| Yes, he is here today, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| I have no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I'm glad to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Where is he at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| Can we recognize him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Where is Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Anything further, U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Mr. Law Director, none of the paperwork I've got matches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| And I've just hung up the phone from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| And they don't have anything on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| I've got copies of our state license right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| And I personally visited the state office twice to ensure that all this was done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| But I do have copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| I'll make sure that you provide copies at the end of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Fire Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| Any other entities, Knox County entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| I'll tender it to the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Any other commissioners have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| Mr. Patil, how long approximately has beer been sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Mr. Patil, how long approximately has beer been sold, in your estimation, at Three Ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=631)|
| 0:10:38| Since we started the golf course a little over 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| To your knowledge, has there ever been any problem with alcohol consumption at the golf course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| None that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Mr. Minot, do you know of any problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| As far as I know, there's kind of a continuing lineage of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Some of those people have been there since the start of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| My only comment is, it's really about the management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| It starts at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| Whatever their approach is, whatever their review, their purview of how they want this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=675)|
| 0:11:26| course to be, and the kinds of things that are acceptable and unacceptable, I think have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=686)|
| 0:11:34| been fairly constant over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I have full confidence that they will continue to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| I just wanted to make that comment to my colleagues on the board, because I play golf there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| have played golf there for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I have no hesitation at all about approving a beer permit or beer contract with Three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| Ridges and the management that exists there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| What's the fire marshal pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| That inspection was done by our government fire inspector, and I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| His report to me was that it's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| He did his original inspection, advised them in the report that they would need to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| back for re-inspection, and they have not done that as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| We don't have documentation on what they failed the inspection for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Not at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| I can obtain it if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Commissioner, as I understand it, it was mostly some lights being out on exit signs, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| have been repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| So, I believe we called back for the re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| Commissioner, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| I was going to make a motion pending documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| I have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| I was just going to say, your revenue figures are $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Knowing now that Commissioner Norman and his friends play golf there regularly, you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| see a significant increase in that $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| Could you bring Mr. Brown up here with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| As he's coming, let's go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| We have a motion, a first, and a second, and I want to comment afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Let's vote on the motion to approve pending the fire department's, what they come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| there, with the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Is that the motion, Mr. Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Just wanted to pass on to you, good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| I remember when it was open 15 years ago, I still got sitting in my drawer, I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| a certificate for a free round of golf, so I showed you how much that I play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| I need to give that to somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Tony, you come over and see me, I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| It's probably more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Doug, tell us real quick, we mentioned the $25,000 and the other $25,000, you're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| $50,000, but overall, are you going to save some more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| For Knox County, because you dropped the contract with the other people, you're letting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| prisoners, are going to cut some of the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| Let the people at home know a little bit more what you anticipate you're really going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| save through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| There was a lot of debate about whether to do this as a county operation or not, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| certainly I debated a lot, especially on the financial side, but we do feel at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| The golf management business has just changed a lot to where the county would not see anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| near the revenue that it used to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| If we could have the same deal, we'd probably continue it, but it's not out there anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| so it was time to look at bringing it in-house, and being that this facility was built to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| buffer the community from the Knox County Detention Facility, and the fact that if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| county runs it, we can use inmate labor to assist on maintenance, whereas a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| that was one of the many items that made sense to bring this in-house and operate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| And obviously, too, we have a very good golf board that's included almost all the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| from the old greens committee, as well as several new ones, two current county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| many former commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| So we have some very good eyes on the operation, and we want to be sure that it stays very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| professional and very well managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Well, we wish you the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Mr. Brown, anything you'd like to say for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Well, it's to maintain the current conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| I was curious about one thing real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| You were talking about the employees that are now going to transfer to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Did they have benefits before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| Did they have health insurance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Did they have retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| Most of them were part-time employees that are just fill-in positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| But the ones before that are full-time, yes, they did have benefits, but not quite as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| So we're going to give them some better benefits by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| So I think it's a win-win situation for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Thank you, and good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Donald Ray Wood, Donnie's Tavern, 1606 Merrill Pike, for own-and-off premises, formerly B. Chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=937)|
| 0:15:50| One last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Doug, before we go, Wendy, make sure you get to the clerk what the law director was asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| the copies, if you'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| And the existing beer permit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Gentlemen, please state your name for the record if you're both going to testify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| Bill Poe, 553 North Cunningham, Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| I'm Donald Wood, 1605 Merrill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| They'd like to put this off until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| They've lacked some paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Are you asking for a continuance, gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| A little light sign, anything you want to say to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| If you'll come back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| When is the next board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| It'll be the fourth Monday in January, 1 o'clock, weather permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1004)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Consideration of hours for selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1020)|
| 0:17:09| U.K., did you want to speak or Laudra, whoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| U.K., was this put on your request, hours of sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| I thought the chairman, but I sure would put it on there if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Yes, it's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| I believe during the last meeting, U.K. had mentioned to the board that he was seeking to have the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| sale of beer hours in consonance with the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| I think in previous years, the county had tried the reverse, and that wasn't effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| So I'll defer to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| What are those hours again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| U.K., you want to give us the hours that I wrote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Well, I think I've got them wrote down here, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| Knox County, no sale between 3 a.m. and 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| And then on Sunday, no sale between 3 a.m. and 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| That's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Then the city, they cannot sell from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. on the weekdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1085)|
| 0:18:13| And Sunday, 3 a.m. to 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| So it looks like we'll just be Monday through Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| It looks like the change that we'll be making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Is that right, U.K.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Yes, they start at 5 a.m. Monday through Saturday and go to 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| And on Sunday, they start at 10 Sunday morning and go to 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1109)|
| 0:18:42| And the reason we're doing this, of course, is, you know, if you're working at Weigel's or Pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| or whatever and you're working at Straw Plains and then they send you down to Bearden or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| you may just, out of mistake, you may be, your home base may be at Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| You may be in the county or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| And then all of a sudden, you're working in the city and just unbeknownst to that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| that's what they normally sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| So we're just going to try to make it easier for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| I'll make a motion that we establish our beer hours to coincide with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| If I could, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Our beer hours are established by way of an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| So it would require an amendment to that ordinance, which is morphed into the documents I sent you previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| to start reviewing in terms of revising our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| So technically, you'd actually have to have an amended ordinance for it to be lawfully effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| So we should refer it to you to draw up the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I'll make a motion then that we refer it to the law department to draw up language for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| First, who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Finbar's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| This is coming as a recommendation from this body, though, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Yeah, if we vote to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| All in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Like to sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| There's something else for you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Anything else come before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| One other thing, we need an update on the Dollar General store on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| We've been asked to look at what's going on, what do we need now from the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Do you have any update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| I do not have that file, but he has never called back for, he called back for one re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Had done two or three things off of the ten-thing list, but hadn't done everything and has never called back since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| And it's up to them to call you, so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| And that's clearly noted on the report that it's their obligation to call back for re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| Although I have called him at least on two occasions to inquire as to where he was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Well, we appreciate you being proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| And how long has that been now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| I haven't heard from him in over a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| I will make another phone call, though, to see where he's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| I'm sorry, whoever was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Who's first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| Brad, your light's on and so is Mike's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Go ahead, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Mr. Fire Marshal, I would like to ask two things from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| One is, do we generally on a, if we go out on a first inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| and we find, let's say we find five items on that inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| and then we come back out to re-inspect before the beer board meeting, do we look for other violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| or do we just stick with checking to make sure they checked off on those five violations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Because what we have is you may go out there two or three times and find three or four different lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| No, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| We generally go out, do the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| Those violations that were noted on the original inspection is what we check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Now, if I go out there on a re-inspection and all of a sudden he's put chains and padlocks on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| obviously I'm going to tell him about that if it's of a life safety nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| But on general, just little things, we don't go back time and time again and give him a new list every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| You don't do a full inspection every time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| We do the one full inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| And then we use that inspection report to do the re-inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| And the second thing I would refer, I don't know about everybody else, Phil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| but when you say pending, I'd like to know what they're pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Just if it's a safety issue versus a not having an ox box issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| That would be good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Yeah, we don't care what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| That's good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I do have a little bit of information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I went out there myself and I looked at the report and what it showed was pending was a couple of caps on the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| connections out back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| The one big thing was it called for sprinklers underneath the duct work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| Now, this wasn't on the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| It only came about on the second inspection when the store manager, after the first, let me go back a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1371)|
| 0:22:59| After the first inspection, the store manager at that time called an independent outside group to come in, Simplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| And this was their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Of course, they sell sprinkler systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| So naturally, I mean, I got a feeling that's what this is because in the building here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| this should be grandfathered in, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| And number two, I don't believe that it's required to have sprinklers underneath duct work when your building is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| sprinklered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| So this was about five grand, which the company did not want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| So that's why this has been kind of held up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I did talk to the new manager there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| He told me he was going to call you to get back out and get --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| And from what I understand, those two caps have been taken care of on your connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I haven't heard from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| I would like to respond to the issue on the sprinklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| What generally happens when we do the inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| we will ask for a current sprinkler inspection report from a state-licensed sprinkler contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| If the sprinkler contractor lists deficiencies on that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| those then become deficiencies to our inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| NFPA 13, which is the code that governs sprinkler system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| does in fact require any obstruction to the sprinkler system greater than four feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| and those ducts are greater than four feet, to be sprinkled underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| I thought you were going to get 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| About four feet in width or depth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| Any obstruction, width or depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| It's a four-by-four measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| If it's greater than that, then you've got a 15-foot ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| No, it's not lengthwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| It would be width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| In other words, if you've got 25 foot of three-foot duct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| that wouldn't be an obstruction to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| If you've got 25 foot of four-foot one-inch duct, then it is an obstruction to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| But if it's only one foot thick and your ceilings are 15 feet high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| The water is going to be spreading over that entire floor anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Except under that four-foot obstruction, and that's by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| The code actually does require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| I appreciate you going out and doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Mr. Law Director, did you want to address about bringing it to this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| This board is empowered to summon this applicant before it to explain its status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| and what manner it's going to do to take remedial measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So they're empowered certainly to send them a notice to appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| and at that time they can explain whether or not they've completed these requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| or what they feel their legal basis is for not complying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| That's certainly the board's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| I don't know if the board thinks that that's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| You want to give this individual his time to do his work when he brings it up to code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Yes, I think we should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| And I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| And also that he should be contacted about getting his updated inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| There's been a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And that would be at the January meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| And it may be that he's going out there and he has everything marked off by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| He may not have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| In general terms, that is what happens a lot of the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| They just fail to call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| I mean, the stuff is done, but I don't know it's done unless they let me know that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| We have a motion been made and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1607)|

| 0:26:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Now, will the clerk then send him this individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| You'll be posting it to the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| On the dollar, General?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1627)|

| 0:27:10| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| We just need to come before the beer board at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1635)|

| 0:28:17| Mr. Chairman, I will note that Amy remains hospitalized and our thoughts go with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| She is watching from Fort Sanders on the naughty nice patrol of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Are you making a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| We have 17 commissioners present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| As Commissioner Harmon said, our colleague Amy Burroughs is still in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| Get well, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| We are all praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1721)|

| 0:28:45| How is she doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| How is she doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Well, she is having a series of tests that are trying to isolate just what went wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| and their post-surgical complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| In terms of her spirits, they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| Our devotional this month will be led by Commissioner Mike Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| and our Pledge of Allegiance will be led by Commissioner Ed Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| Can we bow, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Our Heavenly Father, we thank you for this another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| We thank you, Lord, for all of your blessings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1757)|

| 0:29:22| that we might make decisions based on sound judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| It asks you to be with each one of us and forgive us of our sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| These things we ask in Christ's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1770)|

| 0:29:53| Please bow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1793)|
| 0:30:04| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| One, we're going to have the report from the Tax Management Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| They have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And also, the law department has approved an agreement for a Clearview easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| on 1801 Woodson Drive from Paul E. Rogers, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| That should be 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1834)|

| 0:31:29| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| I'd like to get a motion for consent items, withdrawals, and postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| that are already on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=1905)|

| 0:37:55| 7-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I'd like to call on the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| Mr. Chairman, we have researched all of the state statutes and looked at cases on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2287)|
| 0:38:17| and our independent research confirms what has been reported to us by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| We also checked with both CTAS and MTAS to see if they had looked at these issues before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2304)|
| 0:38:34| and they concur that in Tennessee there is a case, the Blazer case, that arose in Cocke County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2314)|
| 0:38:46| where the county executive, and this is a Tennessee Supreme Court case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| And without going into greater detail than need be, the end result is that when a public official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2332)|
| 0:39:03| leaves office in the circumstances before us, then a replacement is chosen that if there is an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2343)|
| 0:39:19| and the appeal is successful, then the appellant is automatically entitled to go back into office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2359)|
| 0:39:33| And whoever was appointed or even elected must vacate the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2373)|
| 0:39:42| In the case that I described to you, the Blazer case, after the elected official was forced out of office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2382)|
| 0:39:55| the local legislative body appointed a successor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| And then at the next regularly scheduled general election, that same individual stood for election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| and was successful and was elected as county executive in Cocke County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2409)|
| 0:40:18| But that next regularly scheduled general election where they were elected was still to fill the unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2418)|
| 0:40:28| So the term of the county executive who had to leave office had not yet expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| When that person succeeded on appeal, the court ruled that they were entitled to step back into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2434)|
| 0:40:44| until the end of the term that they were originally elected to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| So now let me point out the caveats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2450)|
| 0:40:57| That case was not one under the ouster statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| That case was one where there's another state law that says if a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| an elected official is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor, they automatically have to leave office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2473)|
| 0:41:23| They're out by operation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| But in the discussion of the effect of leaving office and coming back into office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| if you read the Blaser decision, it speaks in general terms about policy reasons to substantiate the court's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2493)|
| 0:41:44| It wasn't referring specifically to the statutes that operated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| but it was referring generally to when you have a vacancy in an office pursuant to a court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2509)|
| 0:41:58| or for reasons in state law that require an elected official to vacate office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| And those same principles apply in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| And I'll tell you there is not a definitive case under the Tennessee ouster statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| that specifically addresses the issue that you're considering now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| and that is there's no question that a commission has the power to appoint someone to fill this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2546)|
| 0:42:36| The real question is what would be the legal effect of the appeal if it were successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2556)|
| 0:42:45| Would that create additional litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| And based on our research, it's my opinion that if this commission chooses to appoint someone to fill the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2570)|
| 0:43:05| if the appeal is successful, then former Commissioner Moore would be entitled to retake his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2585)|
| 0:43:19| I'll also mention in that Cock County case, the county executive who was appointed to fill the vacancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| who then won election also filed suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| But that suit was dismissed by the trial court on the basis of the Blaser decision that I just mentioned to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2614)|
| 0:43:45| And I believe it was Butler was the second individual who was appointed to fill the unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2625)|
| 0:43:55| And that appeal was also dismissed by the Supreme Court on the basis of the Blaser decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2635)|
| 0:44:05| So that's the state of the law as we see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| I'd like to ask you, do we know when his trial will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| I believe that it's – you mean the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| It's an expedited appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I believe it's scheduled to be heard in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| That's, I believe, when oral argument would be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| Now, after oral argument, there's no set time for the Court of Appeals to render its decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2671)|
| 0:44:43| But there is a statute that applies to the situation that calls for expedited appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| And I believe that the Court of Appeals would move quickly to decide that appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2690)|
| 0:45:04| There's also the possibility, yet again, that if –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2704)|
| 0:45:12| whichever side prevails in the Court of Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| then they can then attempt to get the Supreme Court to hear the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| So that might not be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| The reason I ask that question is because it takes us at least a month, a month-and-a-half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| two months to get someone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Yes, Mr. Lauder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Here's what our thinking is or what I had envisioned is that we would be appointing a caretaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| to fill that position with he or she knowing that if Commissioner Moore does win his appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| that he would be right back in his seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and then they would be out sort of like what we had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| So looking at it that way, then would that – is that okay to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| What's your opinion on doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| In other words, folks, the people that would be applying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| this could be the two- or three-month situation or it could be up to 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| They'd know that going in up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| My concern when this issue first came up was whether or not you could appoint someone conditionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2778)|
| 0:46:28| meaning could you appoint someone and as part of the appointment process say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| you know, we're appointing you, John Q. Citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| with the understanding that if former Commissioner Moore is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| you'll have to agree to step down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| And I didn't really know if you could do that because the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| and the charter doesn't specifically address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| In fact, they both speak in terms of filling the unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| So my concern was that if you appointed someone to fill the unexpired term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| they might have a legal argument that I can't be forced out of office before the end of that unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2826)|
| 0:47:15| The Blazer case that I talked about a moment ago, I think, takes care of that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| and it says that if the appellant, the person who was forced out of office, is successful on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2842)|
| 0:47:32| that whoever is appointed to fill the vacancy is automatically disqualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2852)|
| 0:47:40| that they're out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| So in that situation, I think that addresses that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| Now, I think that if we have a scenario where if the Court of Appeals says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2870)|
| 0:48:02| if they reverse the trial court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2882)|
| 0:48:11| then there's a possibility that the plaintiffs would attempt to get the Supreme Court to hear the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2891)|
| 0:48:22| Still, I think under Blazer, in that interim period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| and keep in mind that's a, to the Supreme Court, that's a discretionary appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| The Supreme Court doesn't have to hear that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| Whoever loses, if they decide to appeal, would have to ask the Supreme Court to hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2918)|
| 0:48:45| and then the Supreme Court would say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| And if the Supreme Court said no, that would be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| If the Supreme Court said yes, then you would be back in the situation of both parties would brief it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| argue it, and you'd have to wait on a decision from the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| You know, Mr. Chairman, it's not a question whether or not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| that I can do the job in the district with being one commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| I just, it really hit me with what Commissioner Lutho said at a meeting back when he was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| to get Commissioner Armstrong in to get, everybody get their full representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| You know, where some districts have three and now we're at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| I'm just trying to get our equal share for our district is what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Well, you started to answer the question I had as far as the appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| Let's say Commissioner Moore is successful in the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| and then I guess he'd immediately take his seat back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| And then if the other side decided to appeal it to the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| and they decided to hear it, would there be a stay on him taking his seat back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| or would he be in there and then possibly be removed again if the Supreme Court agreed with the trial court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| and would be flip-flopping back and forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| You could have Mr. Moore could succeed in the Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3011)|
| 0:50:17| and then we can't predict what might happen with the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| Now, as far as a stay, it's unusual because a stay of a judgment is something that's specifically addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3023)|
| 0:50:32| in the rules of civil procedure and the rules of appellate procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| But in the ouster statute, it does not allow a stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| So that's why at the trial court level, when the court ruled that Mr. Moore should be ousted from office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3042)|
| 0:50:53| there was not the possibility of a stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| The statute speaks directly in those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| It doesn't say whether or not an appellate court can or cannot issue a stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3059)|
| 0:51:09| So we have a possibility of if Commissioner Moore was successful at the appellate court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| and it got appealed to the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| and he would probably take his seat back and then be back to whether or not we may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| he could be ousted by the Supreme Court if they decided with the trial court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and against the appellate court, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| That is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Now, another question is, let's say we do replace Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| Let's say we have a replacement and they've been duly appointed, elected, and they're sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3100)|
| 0:51:48| And let's say Commissioner Moore is successful and remains in his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| Would we owe the salary to that replacement for the rest of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| or would their salary be cut off at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Because once you've been elected to a position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| I mean, what you have is not only the position but the salary that goes with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| The Blaser case addressed both those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| And during the period of ouster, even if Mr. Moore were successful on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3136)|
| 0:52:25| he is not entitled to the salary during the period of time he's out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| By the same token, if the replacement left office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| they would not be entitled to the salary from the point of time that they left the seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3156)|
| 0:52:44| until the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| So we'd have one salary being divided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| I'd hate to be in a position where we were paying two salaries for one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| By a clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Mr. Law Director, this could be quite expensive for the county in this back pay and maybe a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| Is that not right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Well, the county is not a party to this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| We're not, you know, defending and we're not prosecuting this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3198)|
| 0:53:27| So what happens on appeal, you know, the Knox County Law Director's Office is not representing a party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| and the Knox County Law Director's Office, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| we've just expressed the opinion that as regards salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| the county is not going to be liable for two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| It's just the one salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| It's just whoever is entitled to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| That's correct, but I don't believe that you could split that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I may be wrong if Commissioner Moore won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| but what I'm saying is if this person, the statute says we appoint them for the remainder of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3241)|
| 0:54:09| to the next general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Well, the state statute speaks in terms of filling the unexpired term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| However, and again, like I said, that was my concern because of that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| but I think the decision by the Supreme Court in Blazer answered that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| and said that if the person who was ousted from office is successful on appeal before their original term expires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3270)|
| 0:54:42| then they go back into office and the appointee or the so-called caretaker is out of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3282)|
| 0:54:51| So, you know, I don't think you would be legally required to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| If the commission determines that it wants to appoint someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| then I think they're entitled to be paid during the period of time that they're in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| If Mr. Moore is not successful, then obviously they would serve until the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| If he is successful, then they would have to leave office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| Well, you know, we had seven districts up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| One of them didn't have any representation for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| I just think we need to let this lie until we see how this appeal comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| because we've had, like I say, seven districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Six of them only had one representative and the fourth district didn't have any and we got along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| So I would just like to make a motion we let this lie until the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Commissioner Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| I've got sort of mixed emotions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I agree with Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Pinkston, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3356)|
| 0:56:02| It worries me if we do have someone to appoint an individual to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| It just seems like a massive Pandora's box we may be opening up for potential problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| So just bottom line, Mr. Law Director, do you have a recommendation for how we should move forward on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3371)|
| 0:56:20| No, I don't because it's purely a policy decision by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| The law, I think, is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| You are legally entitled to make an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3388)|
| 0:56:38| The argument could be made that the law requires you to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3398)|
| 0:56:44| but the law is silent as to the timing for that action to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3404)|
| 0:56:53| And there are reasons, policy reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| that you could refrain from taking action because of complications that could arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| But I believe that, at least from my standpoint, the questions that I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| the possible legal complications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| and the one that I was most concerned about was the individual who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| if you do decide to appoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| what might be their reaction if Mr. Moore were successful with the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| And I think that the Blaser decision answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| That was a 1981 decision by the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| So as court decisions go, it's relatively recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| It's still good law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| And I would point out one thing that you, you know, one consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| There are five members of the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| That was a 3-2 decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| So there were two dissenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| And Justice DeWoda wrote one of the dissents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| and he argued that the court should have decided otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| But that was a dissent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| It has no force of law at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| The majority opinion is the law in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| To me, I don't think it's that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| You've got a gentleman right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| There's three people here in this audience today that have expressed interest that they would like to fill that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| And if it's known up front, and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| could we even let them even sign a document saying they know that if Commissioner Moore wins his appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| they know that they would be out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I'm thinking we're trying to make this too complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| I mean, if these people know that they just would be caretakers until his appeal is over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| can they sign a document stating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| I mean, when we do the interviews, if we're going forth this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and we're doing interviews out in the community and let this be known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| and ask them individually, will you, if Commissioner Moore wins his appeal, will you step aside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| I don't think anybody's going to tell us no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| If you're asking me if that's advisable, I would recommend against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| I don't think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| I do think that's a very valid question to be put to those who are interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| I mean, it's about serving the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| We're here to do public work, not to do a power struggle or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| And if you've got people that are willing to serve the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| and will state that they will go away if Commissioner Moore wins his appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3582)|
| 0:59:49| I think it would look pretty bad on them if they sit there and say, no, I'm not going off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Law Director, as I recall in the last session of the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| a law was passed which said that we would need to fill vacancies within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| I don't know, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I can look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| I would ask that you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| It came up in the last session, sponsored, I believe, by Senator Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| and the Senate, and I forget who else, but I believe that is the law now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| that we are required to fill a vacancy within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| Now, we do have special circumstances here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And so those circumstances may figure into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| But I would ask that you look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Well, I can have an answer before this meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| But what special circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| Well, the ouster proceeding, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| And I don't know how the law was written with the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| That's why I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| But I would ask that you look into that because I do believe that that law was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| and that it is state law that it has to be filled within 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I'd like to add a little bit of citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| I participated in a parade in halls recently with the Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| I was helping them hand out candy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| And I was asked that evening why the seat hadn't been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| My wife and I were exercised at a location in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| I was asked this morning why the seat had not been filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3676)|
| 1:01:22| Then I can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Sitting in the 8th District, it only occurred for very few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| But I really missed Commissioner Ballard being the other person representing the 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| mainly because the 8th is so large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| But still, there was a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| There was a void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| If we're getting advice saying the seat can be filled, then it ought to be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| If we're receiving advice that if Mr. Moore is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| then the seat is then refilled by Mr. Moore, that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| But I think those are the things that are before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| and that's probably the route that I would vote that we travel down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| Sir, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| My name is Chuck Severance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| I'm at 821 East Bull Run Valley Drive in High School, Tennessee, 37754.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3738)|
| 1:02:26| First of all, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for letting me stand here before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| I am one of the people of interest that would like to fill the vacancy of Mr. Moore's seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| And the reason I did come before you is because I did hear a motion that was made to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| until the appeals process was over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| I'd like to go on record as saying I would very much consider it an honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| and a privilege to be able to fill the unexpired term or the vacancy during the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| Would I be willing to sign something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| I am here to serve Knox County and its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| And I would also do it without pay if that is also part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| I just wanted to let you know what Larry was saying as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I very much would like the opportunity and would be willing to sign if that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| But I can stand here before you today and unequivocally tell you that I would be willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| And if the appeals process of Mr. Moore was reinstated to his seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| that I would step down unequivocally and without problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| And you wouldn't have to worry about Chuck Severance being out there suing the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| or the county to be back into that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| So I just wanted to let that be known today and I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| I guess I just wanted a little more clarification on Commissioner Pinkston's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| Are you putting a timeline on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| Are you saying 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| It sounds like the court case is going to be heard within 30 to 45 days or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3845)|
| 1:04:13| And if not, would that be something that you'd be in favor of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| Because with the potential information that Commissioner Hammond brought forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| it would be nice if we could get this resolved within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| If the judge hadn't acted within, say, 30 days, we still have some time to have a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| Well, I think we need to wait until the appeals process is over because I really believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| and I'm no lawyer, but I really believe that Commissioner Moore could demand full back pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| Now, Mr. Severance says he'll do it without any pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| That would be all right with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| But I think, you know, we still live in a country where we have a process you go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| to whether you're found guilty or not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| I just want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| I don't mean the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| I just mean to the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| So is it feasible to put a 90-day window on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| Because what I'd hate to do is have this, you know, someone could come in in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| and delay the process another 30 days, you know, lawyers for the defense or for the prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| So I'd hate to not put a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| I would go for the 90 days if that's what you're recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| I mean, I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| I just wanted to say while I appreciate the generosity of Mr. Severance's offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| I don't think it's appropriate for anyone to serve without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| There's a reason why in our society that officials are paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3938)|
| 1:05:44| It's because generally folks get paid one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| And we would prefer that our representatives in this country be paid, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| by the taxpayers rather than finding other ways to compensate themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| So if we do replace this position, I would insist that that would be a full paid position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3958)|
| 1:06:06| just like any other commissioner that sits up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| Also, I do support putting this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| This commission went a long time without a number of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| In fact, we have the fourth district that was not represented at all for a considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3978)|
| 1:06:25| So I don't think it's too much to ask that we wait and see how this appeal turns out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| This has been one of the most turbulent times in Knox County history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| And I don't think we need to do anything by making it more turbulent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we lay this on the table to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| He is asking his staff to look at this state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| That could very well have a bearing on what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I'm not asking that we postpone it until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4013)|

| 1:15:16| This is a resolution approving an agreement for the Clearview easement at 1801 Woodson Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| from Paul E. Rogers, Jr. and Janine E. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4522)|
| 1:15:31| I need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I'll be moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| Nine-oh-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| This is a resolution approving an agreement with the City of Knoxville for the rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| of the former Fifth Avenue Motel into Menville Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| Nine-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Seven-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I'll be moved and seconded, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| Mr. Chairman, I think it appropriate now to consider an amendment to this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4567)|
| 1:16:15| because clearly we've been struggling to find a way to assure a spreading out of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| And we had a very good workshop with certain fair share provisions came into play in the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| and modeling this amendment after those is what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| So here's the wording I propose to be amended to the contract language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| The party to this plan, known as the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| agrees that the next time it seeks funds under the control of Knox County for any project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| that project must be outside the city limits of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| Should the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness fail in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| the money from this grant must be refunded to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| I think this, in effect, says next time you come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| come with something that spreads it out to a different part of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| It's not zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| It's a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| It presents no issues of discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I think it's a very reasonable provision that would hold this particular contract as a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| for how we spread out homeless services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| and hold those who have spoken on this issue to their words to put homeless services in a variety of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| We have learned through that workshop that services can be brought to persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| Persons don't have to go to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| And so, therefore, I think it's a very reasonable thing to do, and I would move this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| Do we have a second to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| I'm not going to support this for different reasons than Mr. Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| I am all for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| I have supported every downtown TIF that has come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| because historic preservation is something that I believe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| I also believe in the housing first model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| It's a model that makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| What I don't think makes a lot of sense is using a historic building that's going to cost an awful lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4699)|
| 1:18:28| to restore for housing of homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| It's not that I have anything against the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It's just that I think that the housing first model can be implemented with housing that is significantly less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| expensive than this would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| What we're essentially talking about here is we're talking about spending $125,000 apiece for small efficiency apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4727)|
| 1:18:57| I think we can do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| And I think if we do better than that, that we can provide housing and housing first for more homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4739)|
| 1:19:08| I just don't think it makes a lot of sense to do a gold-plated luxury project like this for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| for the housing of homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| And I think it squanders money that could be used to provide housing for more homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| So I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| And I just think it's very irresponsible to spend this kind of money per unit on homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| I believe that this building probably has some merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| It is a very interesting structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| It's one of our oldest structures in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| And I believe that if a restoration project were to be brought to us to put some sort of an office building in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4780)|
| 1:19:47| I would probably support that because these are rather interesting buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| But I just believe that we can put our money in a better place to provide housing first to the homeless in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4792)|
| 1:20:00| where it's not going to cost us $125,000 apiece for efficiency apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| For $125,000, Habitat for Humanity, I believe, could probably build us a couple of homes for that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4807)|
| 1:20:15| So I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| And thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I'd just like some clarification from Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Is your amendment only for this one project or for all of these projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| Simply it says the next time it seeks funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| So presumably that would, you know, expire after the next time it seeks funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| But all it's saying is the next time you come before us seeking county funds, have that project be outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| Three and four projects down the road, obviously, would be not enforceable, not part of this resolution, not part of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| Well, but still, there are more than one group that is getting into this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Is this going to apply to them all or just this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Well, it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| If you would like this provision to apply to all persons associated with the receipt of this grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| I'd be happy to accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| That's what I can live with because based on our discussion on Thursday night with our joint meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| I think we've got a long way to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Then I will amend the wording to say all parties associated with the receipt of this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| Mr. McKenzie, do you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Yes, I'll agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Yes, this question is for Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Mr. Lawler, did you bid on this job, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| Did I bid on this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Who's doing the construction work on this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Okay, I know where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| That's a common misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| Four contractors bid on this job, Merrick Construction, Creative Structures, Wood Brothers and Denark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4909)|
| 1:21:58| Wood Brothers Construction was the low bidder on the project and will be the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| My name is John Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| My father and Pat Wood created Lawler Wood 35 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| Mike and Jerry Wood, who are brothers of Pat, started Wood Brothers Construction I don't know how long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| It has no relationship at all to Pat Wood or to Lawler Wood or to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| No, I'm not talking about that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| What I'm asking is who was the low bid on this and what was the low bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| Wood Brothers Construction was the low bid on the project at $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| Now what are they needing to do this job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| It's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| The bid came in in June of 2008 and the total project cost is $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4965)|
| 1:22:54| That's all soft costs and hard costs put together in contingency make up the $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| It's developer fees, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| So the hard cost component is $4.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Well, why are you coming back to the city and the county needing more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| Did you not apply for this money first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| No, the structure of a project like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| and I think I can speak to Commissioner Lambert's issue also is it's very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| We're using 12 different sources of funds to fund the entire development budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| Two of those sources are tax credit related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| One is low income housing tax credits and the other is historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| The historic overlay on the building gave the developer the opportunity to consider the use of historic credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| which will bring to the table a little over a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| But what's happened in light of this market, the tax credit market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| when this project was originally contemplated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| tax credits were selling for 95 cents on a dollar, low income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| Today, we have an investor at 80 cents on a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| So the market has moved on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| therefore requiring more funds to meet the source demand of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| Originally also the developer thought that the project hard costs were coming less than it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| And so he was surprised once the construction drawings were generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| and the bid was presented, the low bid was more than he thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| So, again, we had to come up with more funds for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| You're talking how many square feet is there in this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| Thirty-six thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| It's 57 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| It comes out, like Commissioner Lambert said, over $120,000 per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| For historic rehab, for the use of permanent supportive housing, this may shock you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| this is at the low end of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| Historic rehabs, because of all the nuances of preserving the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| tend to be more expensive than just new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| You're talking about spending well over $200 a square foot then, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| But remember, we're bringing over $3 million of corporate investment in here that would have never been here otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| because of using the tax credits and specifically the historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| It's the only way the historic nature of the building could be preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| and an asset that's currently a liability in the community become a real asset for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| So, I think the developer was pretty creative in figuring out how to save the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| preserve it historically, and at the same time create a use for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| which is a type of affordable housing that is definitely in need in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| Now, what you're saying is regardless of what the bid was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| if you took the next bid, you would still need this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| This bid, I mean, we were going to give it to the low bidder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| but we would have needed more money had we gone to the next lowest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Commissioner Fondas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Keep in mind what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| the county pass-through would be a quarter of a million dollars from a community development block grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| So, we're not talking $7 million here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5177)|
| 1:26:20| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Your portion is significant, but it's a small portion of the total sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| It's $250,000 of the $7 million that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| And as I understand it, while I know the per square foot cost is about $200 a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| but we're not talking gold-plated marble counters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| We're talking pretty basic stuff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| You would think you would need that, that you would get that for that price, but that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| Because of the nature of preserving a building like this, the efficiencies you get, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| in locating bathrooms back-to-back and so you save on plumbing and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| you don't get those efficiencies in a historic rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| So, you do have the expenses we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| This is going to be nice, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| I can't say that it is going to be gold-plated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I certainly understand the concerns of Commissioner Harmon and Commissioner Rawls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| because we've heard her opinion on this, the great concentration of homeless facilities in their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5242)|
| 1:27:30| The boundary we're setting here, sort of an arbitrary boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| I guess this being the city limits sort of reminds me of what we did a few weeks back with the two-mile perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| And I would just ask the law director, does this raise the federal housing issues again if we were to pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5263)|
| 1:27:55| It does raise several issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| Commissioner Harmon mentioned this fair share program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| and that's where he took the language from the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| And there was a presentation at that workshop by Mr. Klon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| who was familiar with the fair share because I believe he came here from Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| Yes, he's a resident of Chicago currently, but he worked in Tempe at the time that the fair share concept emerged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5298)|
| 1:28:26| However, his understanding of what the fair share and how we're using it may be a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| Well, that's just it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Commissioner Harmon asked me to speak to Mr. Klon regarding how those programs had been implemented, and I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5312)|
| 1:28:42| And if you could read the language of your proposed amendment one more time, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5322)|
| 1:28:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| As suggested by Commissioner Brown, here's how it now reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| All parties associated with receipt of this grant agree that the next time they seek funds under the control of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| for any project, that project must be outside the city limits of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| Should any parties associated with receipt of this grant fail in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| the money from the grant must be returned to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| And this is the way it was described to me by Mr. Klon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| The language that you just read speaked in terms of the parties agreeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| and you were talking about that that would be in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| The way it was described was that communities in Tempe who were willing to participate in providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5377)|
| 1:29:51| for the homeless to locate in their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| those neighborhoods would approach the government granting agencies themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5396)|
| 1:30:03| and indicate we're willing to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| That's why it was described as an agreement between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5407)|
| 1:30:14| Now, no one's asked Mr. Lawler that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| And if in this instance, if you are willing to such an agreement in the contract governing this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5419)|
| 1:30:32| then that's an agreement by the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And then I think that would be binding on Mr. Lawler and his agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5437)|
| 1:30:46| As far as it being binding on other agencies who are not a party to this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5446)|
| 1:30:55| that's not in fact an agreement with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| but that's an action by this commission seeking to limit these services within the confines of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5459)|
| 1:31:09| And I think that's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Well, to clarify, this is a provision of a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| And the contract is between Knox County and the recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| The recipients agree to the terms, and the county gives $250,000 of HUD money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| of HUD pass-along money that could be used for any number of purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| So it is within our provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| It was within our rights as a party to that contract to insert a provision like this, take the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| take the obligation that the next time you come before us, the project is outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5499)|
| 1:31:47| Again, Commissioner, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| a contract where you speak in terms of agreement is a document that is negotiated at arm's length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| And you're talking about this commission making a policy decision that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| we will under no circumstances enter into a contract that calls for this money within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5524)|
| 1:32:16| So it's not a negotiated agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| That's a policy decision by this body that's binding in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| For one, for the next project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| And policy decisions are part of the policymaking body, this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| But the issue that has been put to me is whether or not that may run afoul of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| And it gives me great concern that it does just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| I just don't see the legal reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| It's part of a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| I don't know how the entire portion of the county outside the city limits can be considered restrictive zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| and only relevant to one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| No court would go for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| I realize that you're considered legal opinion, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| Well, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| I object to that because it was a personal aside, and I've refrained from the personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| Look, I've taken constitutional law, administrative law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| I've taught mass media law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| I know when we're getting the legal runaround, we're doing it on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| It's a simple amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Either vote it up or vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Don't try to do these delay and distract techniques anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| It's annoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Commissioner Lotho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| I don't know if the mayor or who could answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| If this project does not move forward, what will happen to the Fifth Avenue Motel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| John, I don't know if you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| I mean, because it seemed like there was going to be something else go there to restore it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| and it got to be too expensive for that developer to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| And then we moved on to possibly doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Again, I was not an employee of the city and county when all this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| But the history as an RFP was put out for the use of the Fifth Avenue Motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| because they knew that being a historic structure, they wanted to preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| No for-profit developer could come forward with a response to the RFP that made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| VMC, Volunteer Ministry Center, came forward with a proposal, essentially what you're seeing today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5661)|
| 1:34:29| to use historic tax credits and other financing sources to preserve the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5669)|
| 1:34:36| and at the same time serve the need of the city, which was the provision of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5682)|
| 1:34:43| John Troyer or anybody inside the administration could answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| What will happen to this structure if this were not to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| I'm Eric Hoagland, Director of Knox County Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| To my knowledge, you know, I didn't really follow this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| I believe it started with the city, and, you know, I really don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5706)|
| 1:35:14| We really didn't, weren't consulting on it until it was already going to be given to the VMC for a homeless activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5714)|
| 1:35:23| So, you know, I don't know if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| I guess my point is that if this project doesn't go forward and when we already had an RFP sent out before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5725)|
| 1:35:34| I don't know if it was us or was it the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| The city of Knoxville tried to do something with this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| I'm just curious as to what's going to happen to this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| It's probably going to stay in the state that it's in, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| That would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| It's a blight on the community, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| And so I don't see anybody else lining up to do something with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| I understand where Commissioner Harmon is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| I sympathize with his plight, but I am going to have to vote against the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Mr. Lawler, who owns the property now currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| Currently Volunteer Ministry Center owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Who did they purchase that from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| They purchased it from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| I struggle with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| I'm not against the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I think it will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| I think Housing First will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| But I struggle with spending $7 million on a piece of property that's really not worth anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5792)|
| 1:36:43| And so I can't support putting $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| I think that volunteer ministries could do a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| And I know it's passed through money through community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| But I think that that $250,000 could go a lot farther on another project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5813)|
| 1:36:57| I just don't think that sinking $7 million into a building that in ten years won't be worth half a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5817)|
| 1:37:08| if we put $7 million in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| I just don't believe that it's a good use of our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I think the $250,000 could be spent better elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| And I think that we could do those 53 or 47 units somewhere else that's already been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5837)|
| 1:37:25| And I just, it's not that I'm against the ten-year plan because being in law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| I understand the need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| But I can't see spending $7 million on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| And that's why I can't support the $250,000 pass-through on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| I can completely understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| And I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| I think what I would like for you to keep in mind is what the developer has been successful in doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5866)|
| 1:37:54| is bringing, beside this $250,000, $6,750,000 of investment into the community to make this project a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5874)|
| 1:38:04| Part of it's from funds from THDA Housing Trust Fund, Federal Home Loan Bank Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| It's been a pretty creative approach to fund all the sources necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5889)|
| 1:38:16| And the other side of it is the benefit financially this, a project like this, creates for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| because a chronically homeless individual costs us about $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| If we successfully house those individuals, 57 of them here, the savings to the community is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| So I think we could wrangle all day about the expense of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| We find that it's at the low end of the range of historic rehabs when it comes to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| But the net benefit to the community from a social standpoint and from a financial standpoint is pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5926)|
| 1:38:55| Is this going to be operated just like they've operated their Jackson apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| They have 16 apartments right now on Jackson Avenue, and they operated those very well up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5940)|
| 1:39:10| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Who will own this if it's completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Volunteer Ministry Center will own this through an entity called Menvilla Manor LP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| It's a taxable entity because it's receiving tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| They had to create a new corporate entity to receive those credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| But when you look down the chain, it's Volunteer Ministry Center that will be the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5977)|
| 1:39:38| And then the second question is what is it that's before us right now, a vote on an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| We have a vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5983)|
| 1:39:47| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| My concern a while ago is that with Commissioner Harmon's motion that we were talking about dealing with one company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| and according to the law director's opinion, that's what we would be doing with this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| So I call for the question on this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| Starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Is this in favor of stopping debate or on the amendment itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Stopping the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| On the amendment or on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| On the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Just on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6034)|

| 1:40:39| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Commissioner Ivan-Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6043)|

| 1:40:47| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Commissioner Luthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| Mike, you voted against your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| You want to stop debate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I didn't want to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Motion fails 11 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| Six ayes, 11 noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| John, a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| First of all, will this go on the tax rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| Should it be completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| Is this something that taxes will be paid on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| Yes, it will go on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| The project was successful and get a pilot from the city IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| So, it's payment in lieu of taxes will be the current tax rate, which is $3,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| I want to make sure that I understand the whole scope of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| As I understand it, Commissioner Harmon and Commissioner Burroughs, they're not objecting to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| Their objection is to future projects, which may end up being in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6125)|
| 1:42:12| And I understand, you know, the citizens there who are objecting to the fact that they don't want to become the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| where all of these facilities are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| They feel it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| I believe it needs to be in the different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| But as far as this building and this project, it's my understanding that there's really not an objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| It's the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| I just want to make sure I understood that myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| I can't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| I don't want to speak for Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| But over concentration is the item that brought all this to the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| And what we've tried to do in responding to that concern, because we think it's a valid concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| and a fair concern, is the task force that we have proposed will have all the stakeholders involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| from residents of permanent supportive housing to commissioners, city council members, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| supportive service, neighborhood leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| On that task force so that we will come up with some siding considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| and a common operating definition around those so that we will, the developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| will know how to march forward so over concentration will not become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| So we are trying to accomplish some of the things that Commissioner Harmon is trying to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| but by including all the stakeholders in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Well, whether it's in the contract or not, you will need to come back to us if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| you do come up with something that's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| And I can already tell you I will not vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| And I'm just one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| But I think that may be a sentiment that you're sensing from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| So I think that you're getting the message loud and clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| Don't concentrate it in this one area if we move ahead with this project, but look at other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| Now, the financing of this, $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| We're being asked today to approve $250,000 of community block grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| And these are federal funds, but we have to approve it as kind of a pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| So it's not as if it's coming from our bank account in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| In a sense, we're all paying for it because it's federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| But these are federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Now, where is the additional money coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| If it's a $7 million project, where is the 6.8 coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| Yeah, let me use my memory and so it will be 80 percent accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| As I said before, two forms of funding from tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| Historic tax credits would generate between $1.1 million and $1.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| Low-income housing tax credits would generate between $2.1 million and $2.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| And I give you that range because of the structure we're contemplating right now could help us get to the upper end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6277)|
| 1:44:43| of both of those continuums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Federal home loan bank grant out of Atlanta is $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| We've got a housing trust fund grant from the THDA housing trust fund for $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| The city originally gave Volunteer Ministry Center a $460,000 community development block grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6296)|
| 1:45:05| The city in their NSP funds, I'm not sure if you're familiar with what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| Those came out of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act that was passed by Congress recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| There's going to be as much as $900,000 to $950,000 coming of those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| or a combination of home funds and house income, several different things to give us $950,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6324)|
| 1:45:33| The developer is contributing his fee to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| It's an $850,000 development fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| He's contributing that fee to the project in order to make this thing succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| and to pay down as much of the permanent debt as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| And it will have permanent debt as one of the sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| So I've probably gotten you 80 percent of them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| But as you can see, it's a pretty complex formula, and all those sources are related to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6354)|
| 1:46:00| Communities all over the country are grappling with this homeless problem, and it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| And so this is a solution that a number of communities are looking at to try to get people off the homeless roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| and basically into more productive types of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Now, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| You will have guidelines as to who can move into these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| The 10-year plan is not focused on ending all of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| It's chronically homeless individuals, which comprise probably 20 percent of our homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| This project is targeted at successfully housing chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6391)|
| 1:46:37| And like you said, 340 other metropolitan areas have similar plans to our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6397)|
| 1:46:44| And those that have been implementing for quite a while, Portland, Oregon, Denver, have seen huge success with a similar approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| And this is just a question that just popped into my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Let's say that with the guidelines that you've established for chronic homelessness, because you are using federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| let's say that a family comes to you and says, we want to be considered for one of these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6418)|
| 1:47:04| And they're not, quote, chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| But yet, they fall kind of within the, I mean, I can see some issues here of people who say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| hey, there's a new place here and perhaps let me check and see if I can qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6433)|
| 1:47:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6439)|
| 1:47:20| But you'll have to remember there is an overabundance of chronically homeless as defined by the Department of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| and Urban Development as a disabled individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| They do not have a definition for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| However, whether it's Salvation Army or Knox Area Rescue Ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6452)|
| 1:47:37| those organizations have become very adroit at housing families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| because there are a lot of families that aren't chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| We use the phrase acutely homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| They have experienced extended homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| But Knox Area Rescue Ministry and Salvation Army and others are good at placing families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| This is not the mission of this particular affordable housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| Its mission is to house individuals that are classified as chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6479)|
| 1:48:07| Commissioner Founders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| Thank you, Mr. Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| You know, in my mind, at least, we're dealing with a couple of issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| One has to do with the structure, which I understand to some doesn't look like much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| Let me tell you, from being involved in historic restoration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| this is actually not a bad-looking piece of property and actually has great promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| And I would invite you to look at two projects that Knox Heritage completed last year out on Washington Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| There were two barber homes out there which were not on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| or they hadn't paid taxes in ten years and were in shambles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| And now they are beautifully well-occupied, beautiful homes and enhance that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| And I think the restoration of this structure has good bit of promise in that same arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| However, if we let that building go and it is demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6537)|
| 1:49:01| then we have permanently done away with an opportunity that may exist in greater dollars some years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| So I applaud the city for getting involved in this and volunteer ministries for taking this issue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| So the other issue, obviously, is that of housing the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| So here we've tried to marry the two, and I applaud your work in this arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| I know it has been with some difficulty, and here you are experiencing more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6564)|
| 1:49:30| Let me ask you what Commissioner Harmon has suggested here is that, and I think it's specific to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| is that your next project would not be inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| Now, if that's a contract, as Commissioner Harmon and our law director indicates, is that a contract you can live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6584)|
| 1:49:54| Because I don't know how we can make, in all deference to Commissioner Harmon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| how we can make other entities that may be looking at doing something and asking us for some funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6598)|
| 1:50:05| I don't know how we can make them part of this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| I would tend to lean to the approach that we've taken along once we started hearing from Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| and Commissioner Harmon on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| We understand their interest is doing away with overconcentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| That's why we're taking this task force approach of getting all the stakeholders together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6622)|
| 1:50:27| defining the siting considerations together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| and using the siting considerations to determine where are appropriate sites for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| So that's the approach we'd like to take because we think it involves everyone that needs to be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6636)|
| 1:50:44| Including county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| You're going to have three commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| and then the city council is going to have two from city council on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| So definitely including county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Thank you, Mr. Blower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| I just want to say as far as this amendment goes, and if I were going to vote for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| I'd vote for Mr. Harmon's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| It is meaningless in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| You know, if you make an agreement with your organization saying you're not going to do your next project within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| city limits, well, you probably have a few dozen other organizations that you can do the next project under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| So it's purely a symbolic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| And what it does by saying that is it's saying that we don't want these services concentrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| So even though legally I don't think it's worth the paper it would be written on, symbolically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| it sends out a symbolic message that we don't want one community to be burdened with all of the homeless support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6698)|
| 1:51:46| So I can't see any harm in supporting it because if someone else wants to do another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| they can just do it under another entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| But as far as this project goes, you know, there's some, I've known some fine folks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| where both the husband and the wife were really good people, separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6721)|
| 1:52:09| But their marriage was a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| And I think this marriage is a disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Marion Historic Preservation, which I think is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6735)|
| 1:52:19| If you look at what's happened with Market Square and Gay Street, it's been a wonderful addition to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| It really makes our city much more attractive to folks who visit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| And I think that the ten-year plan is a wonderful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| But when you put those together, what you wind up with is, as I've said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| spending $125,000 per unit on efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| Now, notice this is efficiency, not even one-bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| These are essentially hotel rooms that people will be living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| I don't think that makes much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| And a lot of people keep saying, I mean, and you've just rattled off several different sources of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| Well, I challenge you that every source of that funding was taxpayer funded for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| Now, the folks who are above us who serve on the federal level and on the state level and create these programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| they create these programs and expect that those of us on the local level use a little bit of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| when we let the money so-called pass through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| There's a reason why it passes through us, because we are on the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| and we are supposed to put a common sense filter on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| And I do not think it makes good common sense to spend $125,000 per unit on what amounts to hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6812)|
| 1:53:43| And I think when you put these two together, it's a bad marriage and it's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6823)|
| 1:53:50| Somebody asked a while ago, what's going to happen to this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| And folks said it will stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| I would challenge you that it will not stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| What will happen is that they'll go back to the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| they'll come up with an idea that makes sense for historic preservation, luxury condos, offices, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| Or if they don't, they may make the decision to tear the property down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| that it would be better to tear the building down and use the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| And I hate to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| I don't want to make my friend, Ms. Kim Trent, have a heart attack when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| But while historic preservation is important, not every single building is a candidate for historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6867)|
| 1:54:35| Now, like Mr. Sanders, I believe that this building probably is, just not as homeless housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6875)|
| 1:54:47| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Mr. Lambert asked some questions I was going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| It sounded to me like all of this was government taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| except the $850,000 that Mr. Lawler talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| But getting back to it, I believe this building was built in 1946, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| I don't know the exact date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| 1913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| 1913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| 1913.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Okay, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| But here's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6910)|
| 1:55:11| I think I heard you mention a TIF on this, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| Payment in lieu of taxes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Like a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| That works like a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| No, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6919)|
| 1:55:20| Well, you own it and we pay the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| I mean, we get it back in taxes eventually, like the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| I mean, what it amounts to is the government is billing it for volunteer rescue money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| and we get it back in the taxes that they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| No, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| How does it work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| The owner makes a tax payment, a negotiated payment, which is going to be roughly $3,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| And then they get tax abatement for the term of this one is 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| For whatever the taxes should have been, he gets credit to pay the loan off, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| No, there's no loan against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| It's simply abatement of taxes for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| That's the difference in the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| All right, it's 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6963)|
| 1:56:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Well, what kind of protection do we have in here for the taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| Now, this is going to be on the tax rolls for $3,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Is that for the 30, I mean, 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Now, this is a subsidiary of volunteer rescue, you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| Volunteer ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Volunteer ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| You had to create that because they were getting taxpayer money, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| Because they're getting tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| Tax credits, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6987)|
| 1:56:28| What's to keep them after this 20 years to turn around and sell this back to volunteer ministry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6988)|
| 1:56:34| After they get all these tax credits instead of it going on the tax rolls for the proper amount of tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| What is going to keep them from selling the project after 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| To somebody that doesn't pay taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| Non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7007)|
| 1:56:48| Let me talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| What's going to keep them from doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7010)|
| 1:56:52| I don't know there's, I don't know what would keep them from doing that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| But they could do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| I think without thinking through all the legal implications of having tax credit investors and such, I think after 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| they probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| It belongs to them after 20 years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| Well, it really belongs to them right up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| They're obligated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| Their tax credit investors are in for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| Well, I'm worried there's no protection at all here for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| After 20 years, volunteer ministry can take this thing over and run it any way they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| This just sounds like a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| And, by the way, I wasn't talking about who got the contract on this a while ago when you got leading into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| I was asking you some questions other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| I don't care if Jackie Jones builds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7053)|
| 1:57:36| It don't make any difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| I'm here to look after the taxpayer's dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| But I feel like that most certainly that volunteer ministry, after the 20 years, that they will buy this building from them for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7059)|
| 1:57:48| dollar or whatever and it go into non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| We get no taxes on it at all then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| And there's no safeguards in here for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| And that's what we're up here for is to look after the taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| And I see no safeguards whatsoever here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| One thing that I think we oftentimes overlook, and this is the primary motivation of focusing on the ending of chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7083)|
| 1:58:12| is that chronic homeless individual unhoused costs you and I as taxpayers $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| Once you get them into housing, they cost you significantly less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| So, I think the motivation of volunteer ministry center and the 10-year plan is also considering the taxpayers because it is decreasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7102)|
| 1:58:30| the local load of taxpayer money that a current chronically homeless person consumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7110)|
| 1:58:37| By housing them, that load is disappearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Now, did I understand you to say when Commissioner Anders asked you up here, this Jackson, the one on Jackson Avenue here is basically the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7127)|
| 1:58:48| Volunteer ministry center currently has 16 units above their operational site on Gay Street, Jackson Avenue, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7128)|
| 1:58:55| Have you run a survey to see how much of a load that takes off of the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| I noticed on TV the other day you were talking about, you know, they don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7139)|
| 1:59:03| We don't have personal health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Why should you keep these people still going to the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Have you took a survey to see how much load it takes off of the county in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| Well, on Thursday night when Tim Clont was here, he showed you a couple of studies, one out of Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7152)|
| 1:59:19| This showed that the net change in what it took off of the local taxpayer was it cost in Denver $43,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7159)|
| 1:59:28| a little more than Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| And the local load of that afterward was $9,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| So, that's a net shift of $34,000, which is a significant shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| Did they look at that shift on these people that were put in this housing or the number, amount of money that had declined for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| No, they studied the actual individuals who were placed in housing, 150 to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| They studied what they cost two years prior to housing and then two years after housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| And that's how they came up with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| It's an accurate study of actual lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| And it's bearing itself out all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| But it really bothers me that everything invested here is taxpayer's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7203)|
| 2:00:09| Which is the nature of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| I mean, affordable housing has a lot of incentives to use federal, different federal sources to fund the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7211)|
| 2:00:17| because it's very difficult to make it work on a for-profit basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| Would volunteer ministries be willing that if we pass this, that this property can never be sold to a non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7222)|
| 2:00:34| I can't speak for volunteer ministries, Senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| But, you know, you may go back and talk to them because there's no way that I could ever vote for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| when there's a possibility that it may end up with a non-profit after putting $7 million worth of taxpayer money in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7244)|
| 2:00:50| and us not the taxpayers not getting anything in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| Mr. Law, you had earlier talked about this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| This is the newer task force that you all have kind of envisioned, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7265)|
| 2:01:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| It's the task force that I proposed on Thursday night to the commission and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| and even followed up with an email to Chairman Strickland outlining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| So, I think he said on Thursday night that he would try to recruit three commissioners sometime today to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| So, this task force will be the ultimate deciding body on siting of the next X number of facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7289)|
| 2:01:44| Is that what I hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| I thought I heard you say something up to that point but not say it explicitly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| The charge to the task force is to look at all to first of all identify all siting considerations that are important to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7311)|
| 2:01:59| project like this and then come up with a working definition that's agreeable to all the stakeholders involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7319)|
| 2:02:06| whether it's residents of permanent supportive housing, commissioners, city councilmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| come up and this will be a facilitated process because there will be divergent opinions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| So, it will be coming up with a common operating definition for siting considerations that the developers can use so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7336)|
| 2:02:25| when they come in the community they know exactly how to approach the community and what questions need to be asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| and what things are important to those communities and to the other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| So, I think what I'm hearing you saying is, no, they're not the deciding body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| Well, let me ask this question a little clearer then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| Who will ultimately decide where the next facility goes and the one after that and the one after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| What body, what individual, what office will decide that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| The developers will decide that by taking these siting considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| and using those to identify whether or not a site is appropriate or inappropriate based upon what commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| councilmen, and other stakeholders have established to be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| So, if the developers want to concentrate, I mean, if the next five end up being concentrated, they're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7397)|
| 2:03:28| They're going to be because that's ultimately what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| I think from Thursday night what you remember is one of the key siting considerations that Tim brought forward is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| concentration of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| So, when you get all those stakeholders together, they're going to come up with an operating definition that's going to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| developers understand that over concentration is not going to be acceptable to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7424)|
| 2:03:51| The community wants to see these developed on a scattered site approach spread out throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| So, I think the task force will give real clear definition to a term like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| Wouldn't it be, I mean, you know, if this is a public process and you've gotten a lot of diversity on this with this task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7443)|
| 2:04:10| and bringing developers in, lawmakers, wouldn't it really show commitment if you empower that task force to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7450)|
| 2:04:21| decisions or to give the developer a thumbs up, thumbs down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| Because ultimately a developer has a mission, be it profit or not, but they have a point and a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7465)|
| 2:04:33| Whereas this task force seems like this is a bringing together of all people with a vested interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7473)|
| 2:04:41| And to me it would seem, you know, a good thing to have them make the ultimate decision on whether we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| this project is going to go forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Given the fact that the 10-year plan still has seven and a half years to go operationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| our goal was to come up with exciting considerations and common definitions so that developers six years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7495)|
| 2:05:02| when a lot of us won't be in this room, can still use those considerations to effectively fulfill the mandate of developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7502)|
| 2:05:10| permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| So, our approach was a little different, but I think the result will be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| that these considerations will determine where the housing, the permanent supportive housings could be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| And I guess my last question is, there was another, I don't know what you called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| board group that looked at these siting and other issues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7529)|
| 2:05:39| I think Commissioner Burrell asked why wasn't there someone from the community on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| Oh, good, good for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| It's the 10-year plan advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| Okay, so what, how is that board going to work with this whole thing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7549)|
| 2:05:55| Well, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| Commissioner Burrell has brought to my attention that in the 10-year plan implementation attachment to that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7557)|
| 2:06:05| it talks about neighborhood representation on the advisory board, which is an advisory board that meets quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| I responded by going to COIN, asking for some nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7570)|
| 2:06:15| So, the mayor has recommended that two members from COIN will now serve on the advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| and they'll be at their first advisory board meeting this Friday, the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7582)|
| 2:06:30| I think the empowerment comes with city council or commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7590)|
| 2:06:35| They can turn any project down they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I think what we're dealing with here is more than symbolism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| If it's just symbolism, give it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| But if it's not symbolism, then we can ask why are we doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7611)|
| 2:06:57| We're doing it for the purpose of holding organizations accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| You just heard a good answer that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| this organization had to be reminded about putting neighborhood groups on its advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| Now, when informed, it did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| Task forces, it'll give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| Public meetings, it will give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| But assurances within the contract itself, it balks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| So, you have to wonder about the sincerity of the placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| If you're willing to give us words but not deeds, we have to wonder about future deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| That's why this amendment is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| It's simply saying next time you come before this body asking for money for homeless services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7652)|
| 2:07:42| put it outside the city limits, do a fair share kind of arrangement through contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| It's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| I hope you will vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| I know particularly Commissioner Harmon's been representing a lot of the interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| What did the city council of Knoxville, how did they vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| Have they accepted, objected, or what are their objections or feelings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7681)|
| 2:08:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| Madeline Rojero presented to council the NSP plan, which talked about the total expenditures out of the city of NSP funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7688)|
| 2:08:18| 900,000 of which would go to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| And if the state brings forward their portion of that in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| 800,000 more will go to another yet-to-be-named permanent supportive housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| So the city has voted to give to this project 900,000 additional dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7711)|
| 2:08:39| I see Joe Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Commissioner Briggs, Joe Holquist, Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7723)|
| 2:08:47| We voted on the entire plan, but we had some discussion about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| and that we may want because the plan was rushed because the way the NSP dollars were sent to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7730)|
| 2:08:58| the entire program from Congress through HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| There's very little time to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Everybody understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| So we said, okay, with the understanding that we may have to revisit this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| we're going to approve it as a whole so we can move forward because there was a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| a very unreasonable deadline that Congress and HUD had set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| And I think we're already past that deadline at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7758)|
| 2:09:22| I mean, it was just almost no time at all to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| So I think city community development did a good job under the circumstances of putting together a plan of which this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| the 900,000 was one component of the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| That's 900,000 if the THDA, federal money coming through THDA, is already allocated, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7775)|
| 2:09:44| But the understanding, I mean, I and others, I think, said it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| I know I said it, you know, we need to be clear that we can revisit this if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| And Madeline Rojero said, yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| So and, of course, each individual component, including any agreement to fund MNVLA, comes back to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7796)|
| 2:10:06| So that was the other part of that decision is that this is not final, final because it can come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7806)|
| 2:10:14| So just to sort of sum it up on this particular project, you know, the MNVLA project, is the city for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7814)|
| 2:10:21| or against city council, I guess I should say, as representatives of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| Are you for or against this or what's your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| There was a separate vote on MNVLA and the majority of council members did vote in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7829)|
| 2:10:36| There were a couple of others that did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| But the majority of us, the majority of council did vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| But that was not a vote to end all votes, again, because there are other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| My understanding is that this money will have to be voted on again or some sort of agreement to fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7848)|
| 2:10:54| because you have to have the money first and then you have to agree to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| And this is just the approval of the plan that was passed the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| Yes, I have a question for Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7865)|
| 2:11:08| I want to make sure that I understand what the motion is that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| We're talking about limiting the parties of this particular contract that in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| they and they only are limited to a decision outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| Or are we trying to limit to non-parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| Only the parties to the contract agree that the next time they come before us for public money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| that that project would be outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7900)|
| 2:11:41| So it just involves these parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| Some other parties can come and do as they please inside the city or outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7907)|
| 2:11:50| We're going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7910)|
| 2:11:52| I think everyone is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| Is everyone clear on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| Can you read it for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| This is just the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| Mr. Chairman, if we approve this amendment, we still have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| We still have to vote on the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| Do you want to repeat the amendment one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| All parties associated with receipt of this grant agree that the next time they seek funds under the control of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7936)|
| 2:12:22| Knox County for any project, that project must be outside the city limits of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| Should any party associated with receipt of this grant fail in this regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| the money from this grant must be refunded to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=7957)|

| 2:14:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Ten-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| They got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| Motion passes ten to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| Mr. Chairman, I failed to do something at the beginning of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| R8-12-907, that dealt with the transfer of property over on Hillwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| concerning the Hillcrest KUB deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| I'd like to defer that for 30 days because there's some language that needs to be worked out about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| reversion in case there's no building and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| So if that would be appropriate, I'd like to make the motion that we defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8115)|
| 2:15:20| Can we just wait until we get to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8123)|
| 2:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| Well, we've got a couple of people waiting here to talk on it, and I just wanted to get it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| Well, we can go ahead and defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| Everyone okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8139)|
| 2:15:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8142)|
| 2:15:43| No objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8143)|
| 2:15:44| I need to speak on 901 just real quick, what we just voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| Mr. Lawler, don't leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Let me finish this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8152)|
| 2:15:54| Everyone okay with the deferment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| On 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| On 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8160)|
| 2:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| Mr. Lawler, is the lady from the volunteer mission, is she still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8165)|
| 2:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| I just want to say something just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| You know, we're all about helping our brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| And what we, what I, I don't know if we can do this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| but I'd like to see another Bill Williams on the adult level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8181)|
| 2:16:25| Is there some way, or maybe you people are already working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| but somebody where maybe a man has lost his wife or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| and maybe individuals can take some of these homeless people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| just like what we do on the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| I mean, look at the millions of dollars that we would save in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8197)|
| 2:16:42| Yeah, here she comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| The millions of dollars we would save through the faith-based agencies that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| I know all the Baptist preachers get together once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| some of the other preachers and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| If the churches around would try to adopt, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8214)|
| 2:16:59| some of these people until they get back on their feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| if there's a program like that out there, we wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| This may take care of this 20% that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| If we could have somebody that would maybe step forward like a Bill Williams out in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| that would sort of spearhead something like this, that would save us quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| Because it's like Commissioner Lambert was saying, what you can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| And I've built several Habitat for Humanity houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| You can build those houses and give those individuals to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| But maybe there's somebody out there listening today that would maybe put that challenge in their heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8243)|
| 2:17:29| I think it's an interesting challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| I think for the homeless population in general, it's a very appropriate challenge, episodically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8251)|
| 2:17:38| When you think about the chronically homeless individuals, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| the needs of those individuals to succeed in housing are a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| And the supervision, that's why we talk about permanent supportive housing so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| The support piece is just critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Jenny can tell you more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8272)|
| 2:17:54| But having the faith-based community involved is one of the strategies of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| And we've been successful linking up small groups from the faith-based with individuals that go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| permanent supportive housing to begin to be a part of them reintegrating into healthy communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8285)|
| 2:18:11| So we are doing that, even as we're speaking now, successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Because we believe that reaching stability, then reintegrating into healthy lifestyle patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8295)|
| 2:18:21| is critical for the long-term success of these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| I mean, you would do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| And to me, they would be some great mentors for some of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| They are being great mentors right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| May I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| I need your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8313)|
| 2:18:34| Jenny Weatherstone, the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| And I absolutely agree with what John shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| The individuals that we have placed in housing, we do use mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| And we ask that those mentors work in concert with a professional social worker that has a background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| in some of the problems that these formerly homeless folks are experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8331)|
| 2:18:57| But one other use, if you will, for faith-based mentors, faith-based volunteers that I think is critically important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8337)|
| 2:19:07| is in the area of homeless prevention to try to stop these problems before the individual ever becomes homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8347)|
| 2:19:15| There is another Volunteer Ministry Center program called The Refuge that uses mentors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| that uses volunteers from local churches to do just that, to interview before or to work with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8360)|
| 2:19:27| and to interview them to become involved before homelessness becomes the fact to prevent the homelessness in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| Half the churches would just take one person that we'd have no homeless probably in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| There's so many churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| I absolutely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8383)|
| 2:19:44| Oh, did you have something, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| Yes, I just want to make one comment, not to belabor a point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| But I hope the public doesn't construe some of our negativism here about this particular project is that we're against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8390)|
| 2:20:01| the project or the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| The process is what some of us have a problem dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| The way that this has been stuck where it shouldn't be or we think maybe it shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| or there was no working with communities and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| But my main problem with this one has been expressed by a couple of other people up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8418)|
| 2:20:23| The fact is that the amount of money that it's taken to do this project versus starting from scratch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8423)|
| 2:20:31| $125,000, as has been pointed out, you know, it can go a long ways on making and putting housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8431)|
| 2:20:38| But here you're going to get one little efficiency apartment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| I mean, as Mr. Lambert pointed out, Lambert, Lambert, Lambert, got a new name, Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8442)|
| 2:20:52| You know, $125,000, Habitat can build two houses for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| So, you know, it's not that we're against the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Right now it's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| This is a resolution approving a contract extension in the amount of $497,822| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| with Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, also known as CIGNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| for individual stop-loss insurance for the period beginning July, I'm sorry, January 1, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| and ending December 31, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Eight-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| Any governmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| Seven-oh, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Well, actually, I think on this one we probably need to hear from Mr. Troyer, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| I think Francis can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8499)|
| 2:21:40| Okay, Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Resource Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8501)|
| 2:21:45| Yes, when we were before the committees, the issue at hand was that the low bidder refused to accept one covered member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8505)|
| 2:21:55| whom we believe has a high probability of having a very expensive procedure during the coming calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8515)|
| 2:22:04| Because of the added cost of that exclusion, they were no longer the low bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| So, we went to the second place position, which is CIGNA, and they have agreed to include all employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8530)|
| 2:22:17| all spouses, all children that are covered under our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8537)|
| 2:22:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| Just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| This half million dollars, that's the total contract cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| That is the premium for them to cover all claims that are greater than $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8554)|
| 2:22:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8563)|
| 2:22:44| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8564)|
| 2:22:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| Eight-oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| Nine-oh-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8576)|

| 2:22:58| Nine-oh-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8578)|
| 2:23:01| Nine-oh-seven, we deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| Take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| Nine-oh-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| This is a resolution requesting a copy of all reports and inspections of Hillcrest facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8591)|
| 2:23:16| and that a representative of Hillcrest appear before the commission of an annual basis to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8596)|
| 2:23:23| Well, they're both proof of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| I'll look at the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| I don't defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| Finance is, which one was it, Tank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8613)|
| 2:23:39| I was talking to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| Nine-oh-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| Nine-oh-eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| Nine-oh approved with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| Seven-oh approved with amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8632)|
| 2:23:54| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| What was the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| I think they were just going to forward us their inspections instead of appearing before us on a timed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8640)|
| 2:24:09| Instead of coming before us every year unless we call for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8649)|
| 2:24:12| just send their inspections to us from the state and other agencies that credit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| I don't know if that was our amendment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I believe our amendment was that the reports that they're required to comply with these inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8661)|
| 2:24:29| they get a report and that report will be forwarded to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| But I thought they still were to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| But I think ours was that they would appear before us once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| Is that the motion that you put forth, Commissioner Norman, that they would appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8684)|
| 2:24:48| As far as I know, that was our motion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8688)|
| 2:24:51| Well, you made the motion to approve, so I was just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8694)|
| 2:24:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| First amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| You can go ahead and vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8702)|
| 2:25:03| Mr. Chairman, what I was talking about, we've got Dale Smith, Chief Sterling Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8703)|
| 2:25:08| and J.J. Jones, the sheriff here, to talk about 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| And if this is over, I'd like to put this on the end where we can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8712)|
| 2:25:18| 905 was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| I know it, but they'd like to we'd like to talk about it if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8727)|
| 2:25:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8729)|
| 2:25:32| Sheriff, is there something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8732)|
| 2:25:42| Jimmy Jones, 5212 Winfield Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| I think what we need to talk to you about is we've kicked this idea around a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8745)|
| 2:25:50| For some reason, we've used the word a study for the intake center, a feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8750)|
| 2:25:59| And that's not really what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| We've got some other ideas that we'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| We know the feasibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| Since 2000, every professional consultant who does nothing but work in jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8764)|
| 2:26:11| and intake centers and accreditation companies have said we need an intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8771)|
| 2:26:15| So we know we need an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| I think we used the word feasibility study just because we had that's just what came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8778)|
| 2:26:23| and that's what we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| That's not really what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| And I'd like for Dale Smith to come forward from PBA, maybe tell you a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| And also Owen is here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| And tell you what we think what we'd like for you all to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8792)|
| 2:26:41| Where be he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8801)|
| 2:26:53| Mr. Chair, Commissioners, and I guess thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| I wanted to further clarify what you've used the term feasibility study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8820)|
| 2:27:08| And I think when I first spoke, I said that that really wasn't what I was giving you numbers on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8828)|
| 2:27:17| What I was simply trying to do was estimate what it would cost to develop a really refined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8837)|
| 2:27:25| and firm not to exceed budget for an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8845)|
| 2:27:30| While there's been years of conversation about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| there's been some very, very rough design ideas put down about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8852)|
| 2:27:39| None of that puts anyone in a position to tell you what it will really cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8859)|
| 2:27:44| And particularly when you start talking about tunneling under Hill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8864)|
| 2:27:50| there's enormous unknowns and risks associated with going down into the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8870)|
| 2:27:55| and going through a utility grid, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| So those were the numbers that I put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| That was meant to be a number I was absolutely sure within which we could do all of the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8882)|
| 2:28:10| and design work necessary to develop a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| The number I gave you was like $440,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| It's my belief that we could do this work for substantially less than that, probably $350,000 or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8898)|
| 2:28:25| But until we start doing some of the initial engineering and architectural work, I can't promise you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| And so I just don't want to come throw a number at you that, in fact, I couldn't do the work within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8912)|
| 2:28:40| With that, I'll stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| The other issues you were discussing, which was how much money would be saved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| how much of that savings could be put forward to the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| I think that kind of work between the sheriff and Mr. Troyer's office shouldn't be that hard to do, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8932)|
| 2:29:00| The type of work that I'm talking about doing is strictly the technical engineering, cost estimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8940)|
| 2:29:09| pre-construction work by a contractor, and architectural work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8949)|
| 2:29:17| Dale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8957)|
| 2:29:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8958)|
| 2:29:19| I talked to John today, and he said you and him both could probably do a lot of in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| and lower this quite a bit on the cost and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| Is that correct, in-house work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8966)|
| 2:29:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8968)|
| 2:29:29| There wouldn't be any PBA fees associated with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8969)|
| 2:29:33| That would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8973)|
| 2:29:34| But the numbers I gave you were for outside architects and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8974)|
| 2:29:39| And that type of work is outside our capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8979)|
| 2:29:43| I mean, this would be a lot of work in the ground as well as a lot of architectural and design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| I'd like to speak to Sheriff Jones, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| You have a question for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8994)|
| 2:29:55| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8995)|
| 2:29:56| And Chief Owens, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| If you don't mind, Chief, you come on up here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=8997)|
| 2:30:06| I've got some figures here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9006)|
| 2:30:09| I don't know whether they're right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| You gave me some figures up here at finance meeting today in the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| I've got a different number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Chief, I believe you said we'd save $340,000 here, the city taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| At $350,000, somewhere, a minimum of $350,000 to $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9029)|
| 2:30:30| What about you, Sheriff Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| I think mine was about $400,000, $437,000 to be exact is what my estimate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9031)|
| 2:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9037)|
| 2:30:38| We're talking about roughly $800,000, a little over $800,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9038)|
| 2:30:42| Would you, too, and I know the Chief can't answer this question until he goes back for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| Would you be willing to put the money saved towards this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9049)|
| 2:30:54| towards any bonded indebtedness that we might take on, cut it out of your budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Would you, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| I know you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| Would you be for it, though, if council would go with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9062)|
| 2:31:05| Well, I defer to the mayor and council on that as to what the decision would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| But I'd certainly be willing to talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9069)|
| 2:31:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9072)|
| 2:31:13| Well, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9073)|
| 2:31:24| When, how much money, we've got to close our books in December the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9084)|
| 2:31:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| I mean, you know, for the Knox County file its annual report, financial report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9093)|
| 2:31:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| Could you tell me what kind of surplus we had over last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9099)|
| 2:31:44| Our general fund, we came in about three, three-and-a-half million dollars better than what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9104)|
| 2:31:49| About three-and-a-half million dollars what we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9111)|
| 2:31:52| This year alone now, it looks like we're going to be putting in $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9112)|
| 2:31:58| a little over $300,000 above this year's projected budget on income that we didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9118)|
| 2:32:04| weren't expecting to get in the sale of the two schools in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| I understand that one of them hasn't sold yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9130)|
| 2:32:13| They've got 30 days to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| Dedicated toward the school department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| Well, you know, let me defer this to the law director then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9137)|
| 2:32:21| Mr. Law Director, you know, I passed a resolution here several years ago to try to get the school system turned loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| of these buildings before they got in such bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| But these are two buildings that they turned loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| One of them we've had about 30 years and I think the other one about six or seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| Would they fall in under that category since they were already turned into Knox County as their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9157)|
| 2:32:45| If these, if title to the property came to Knox County rather than the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9165)|
| 2:32:57| then I think the funds from the sales should probably go to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| Although, I will say that I have looked at the two resolutions that were passed last year that spoke in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9184)|
| 2:33:13| selling school property and it didn't limit that to properties that were or that had been transferred to the county or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9193)|
| 2:33:29| So the question is, did title actually pass from those two, from the school board to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| I can't answer that question today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| Well, you know, everybody up here knows I'm conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| And I don't want to spend money we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| We're spending almost a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| And we're talking about $12 million would probably build this deal, 12 to 15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9234)|
| 2:34:03| In eight to ten years, if we dedicate this $250,000, I mean $2.5 million toward this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9243)|
| 2:34:11| that would get us down to roughly say $10 million if the city would do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| which the city's taxpayers are going to save even more money in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| Because they pay county taxes, so Sheriff Jones are paying some of your $500,000, some $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9260)|
| 2:34:25| They're paying all of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| And I would think they'd be willing to come in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9267)|
| 2:34:31| If we floated some bonds on this, the amount of savings that we've got would probably pay for this in 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9271)|
| 2:34:38| And then we would have an intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| Now, my understanding is, and I'm reading the audits that our auditor gives us here on the penal farm out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9281)|
| 2:34:49| we're close to getting full and getting fine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9289)|
| 2:34:52| Is that correct, Sheriff Jones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| We're not under a cap out there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| The key word is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| Also, that's a good point you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| We need to remember that these beds and this intake center will certainly help with our overcrowding problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| out at the Maloneyville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| Just this morning, to give you an example, we had 912 inmates at Maloneyville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| The capacity is 964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| We were 52 away from capacity at Maloneyville Road this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| If we, the Knox County Sheriff's Office, hadn't taken $15,000 out of our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| and double-bumped the new pods, which ended up at 96 beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| if we didn't have those extra 96 beds that we used our money from our budget to do with our labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| we would be in the whole 44 beds right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| We would be over-capped 44 beds if we hadn't double-bumped the facility, the new facility at Maloneyville Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9342)|
| 2:35:49| And I've got probably six newspaper articles here talking about jails that are being decertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9349)|
| 2:35:56| Unicoi County, McMinn County, Blount County, Cocke County, Carroll County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9356)|
| 2:36:04| All these county jails are getting ready to be decertified because they're overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| And I'm not standing up here asking for something frivolous that we don't need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9368)|
| 2:36:14| I'm telling you that in the near future, the Maloneyville facility is going to be at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| We've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| We've got to quit talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9384)|
| 2:36:25| We've talked about it since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9385)|
| 2:36:28| It's time to do something now or we're going to find ourselves with a cap at Maloneyville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| just like we have at this downtown facility at $5,000 a day per prisoner over cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9392)|
| 2:36:39| And that adds up quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| Well, we'll be losing quite a few million dollars if we decertify this, wouldn't we, in grant money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9406)|
| 2:36:47| Dick Moran here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9407)|
| 2:36:57| Dick, I read in the Sentinel here, I guess three or four weeks ago, how crime had gone up in the city and the county both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| Could you tell me how the arrests are broke down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| What percentage of these people are in the city and what people are in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9427)|
| 2:37:16| It's 100 percent of them being in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9436)|
| 2:37:26| At the last meeting, I think it was the intergovernmental, the question came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| and the sheriff asked me to run some numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| The total number of bookings in 2007 were 20,959.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9454)|
| 2:37:40| In 2008, they're about 19,274.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| And we still had three weeks to go in this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| So I'd say they're roughly about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| They've both come up about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| Broken down by city and county, there's roughly in 2007, 4,947, 16,112 in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9473)|
| 2:38:03| So 76 percent of the bookings are the result of city actions and 24 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| For 2008, they break down almost exactly identical, 76 percent to 24 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| Well, the reason why I asked you that, that may give Chief Owens a little ammunition to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| This would greatly benefit the city because they're making most of the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9503)|
| 2:38:28| And that included, those numbers included both the rest on state warrants as well as misdemeanor citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9508)|
| 2:38:35| where people are physically booked but they are not actually arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9515)|
| 2:38:39| They show up at the facility to be processed, to have the mug shots, fingerprints, and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9519)|
| 2:38:45| That's processed just writing them a ticket, then, you might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| Yes, I've just got some comments I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9535)|
| 2:38:58| I don't know if I have any specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| But really, when I put this down as a feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| I really didn't intend for this to be something that was going to, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| cost a lot of money that we would have to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| What I wanted to do, first of all, is to be certain that the commission ascertains that we do, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9553)|
| 2:39:19| need the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| And we haven't had a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| But from what I hear, it sure makes a lot of sense for us to have the intake center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| Just to run these people 34 miles round trip back and forth doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9569)|
| 2:39:34| I think the answer to that is going to be an unequivocal yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| But then, to think the whole project through, we need to look, what are our options downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9578)|
| 2:39:44| We've heard different options from building a building that holds maybe 40 beds to some people have even proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9584)|
| 2:39:52| When we came this evening, there's one from Mr. Monsier saying that we could use some of the cells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9592)|
| 2:39:57| that the women are using now in the lower levels of the facility across Hill Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9597)|
| 2:40:03| And then other options that would include an investment, an adaptation of technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9603)|
| 2:40:08| and video appearances before a judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| It seems to me that having a formal intake center is the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| But in the meantime, is this something that we can do to solve some of the problem of people running back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9616)|
| 2:40:20| and forth until we can get the new center built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| And I believe from our discussion at the finance committee the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9624)|
| 2:40:28| they said it might take a couple of years for the project to come to conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9628)|
| 2:40:34| And also, looking even more down the road, and we were just alluding to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| is to have pretty much a master plan of what we're going to do about the prisoner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9639)|
| 2:40:45| and the prisoner facility overall and how, with what we develop here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9645)|
| 2:40:51| fits in with that whole concept of having enough room for the prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| About the projections for a new pod down the line and how does that fit in with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| And when we build something, it just doesn't need to be done in isolation as an intake center downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| but also to alleviate some of the crowding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9667)|
| 2:41:11| and congestion problems that we're going to have in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| And that's projected out at the Maloneyville facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| And then I want to be certain that there's none of the stakeholders in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9680)|
| 2:41:24| whether it's from some of the people who are opposed to using the green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| to restrictions that the PBA may have on the use of the space so we don't get started into the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| and then find out that we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| And some of the stakeholders may also be the utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9698)|
| 2:41:41| And I think Dale Smith just alluded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| It may be expensive, but just to be certain that there's not going to be some unexpected expense that we run into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9704)|
| 2:41:51| So I think we need to hear from all the stakeholders in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| And then, finally, I think one of the most important parts is how are we going to finance this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9715)|
| 2:42:03| Where does it fit into the budget that we have for this year or the budget for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| If we put this into one of our long-term capitalization plans, how do we prioritize it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9728)|
| 2:42:15| My preference would be for us to go through a normal process for this and expedite it where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9735)|
| 2:42:24| If we think that this is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| and we think that this is something that needs to be moved up on the priority of our capitalization, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9746)|
| 2:42:34| The only difference that I may have with Commissioner Pinkston, because I think on about probably greater than 90% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9754)|
| 2:42:42| this we see eye to eye, is that I really am a firm believer if we have a budget, let's stick to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9762)|
| 2:42:48| And just because some other money shows up here, we have to spend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| And, likewise, we have so many unexpected expenditures that's already come up this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| and we're only six months into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| My preference would be to put this into the formalized budget process if necessary for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9781)|
| 2:43:09| unless we can come up with, I'm talking about for that $440,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| unless we can find a way to do that less expensive, less expensively to get the project on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9794)|
| 2:43:22| And then if we can do that and we decide we want it and we have a good idea about how much it's going to cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9802)|
| 2:43:29| we'll put that $12 million that the project may cost into a higher priority on the long-term capitalization plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9809)|
| 2:43:38| And that's really my whole purpose for bringing this forward is just to try to go through this as a step-by-step process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9818)|
| 2:43:45| look at the big picture, and then think also on the big picture on how we want to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| J.J., could you come down here real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| And Dale, I've got a question for you, the both of you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| J.J., on the, he was talking about the pods, that brought a thought to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| How many more pods can you put out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| I think we have the ability to put two more out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| Of course, if you'll note, with the last study we got, they said we should have had two out there now where we got the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| So we're actually one pod behind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9861)|
| 2:44:22| And the way that you have built, have you built that if you had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9862)|
| 2:44:25| you could build on top of the pods that you have now or is it so they cannot be built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom081215?start=9865)|
