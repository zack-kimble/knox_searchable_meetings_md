| 0:03:00| Okay, moving quickly on to Mayor's Report, I know several of you all have, we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| lots of, I guess nothing new, but lots of renewed conversations about the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| to end chronic homelessness, and I know there's been several questions back and forth in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| of locations and process and where the administration is, and I guess I just wanted to very briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| say I guess three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| Number one, we are still as committed as ever to the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| We think that permanent supportive housing is the right idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| We knew when we began this it would be very difficult both to fund it and to come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| the locations, but that being said, we still think that is the right plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| We also still think it's the right thing to spread the locations around the city, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| we're in the process, we're working hard to do that, but we're still committed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| But third, we're even more committed to making these sites work for nearby neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| So I think we're going to, I don't know if there's any great change, but we want to approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| the challenge of selecting and evaluating sites and maybe clarify that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| We think it's important that there be a clear process by which council can decide on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| appropriateness of a site and a clear avenue for those who have concerns about a site to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| have their questions addressed, and if they oppose a location, to express their reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| for the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| On Thursday, March 18th, there will be a public meeting to discuss the proposed plan to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| a 48-unit complex for permanent supportive housing at the Teeberry Lane location in West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| That's Thursday, March 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| I've asked Bill Lyons to play a role in the process on behalf of the administration in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| supporting the work that John Lawler and the staff of the 10-year plan have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| At the March 18th meeting, Bill and John will present the concept under consideration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| participate in the discussion of any impact on the neighborhood as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| We'll hear from neighbors and others regarding their questions, concerns, and other reactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| This meeting and discussions in the weeks to follow will inform council as they consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| this location as a suitable site for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| We plan on presenting a resolution of conceptual support of this site for council's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| at the April 6th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| While this will not be the final word, council will obviously have to deal with requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| for funding at a later time, it does provide a specific opportunity for honest and thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| discussions of reasons why this site might or might not be suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| Of course, those who believe this site is not appropriate will have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| to present reasons for their opposition to council at any time during and following the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| public meeting as well as on April 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| So just wanted to maybe clarify that process going forward and thought that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Do you give us a time and place for the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| The March 18th meeting, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=334)|

| 0:09:52| Maybe that's more for the police department than for yourself, but I didn't know if your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=592)|

| 0:12:00| Mr. Cole, this goes a bit in the same line of what Councilman De La Volpe is referring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| How do you get a sense of really how your work is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| I know the officer said that you feel like you're reaching into the community, but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| you're wearing a blue uniform, the conversation is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| So how do we have a sense of how are you gaining a sense of how we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=742)|
| 0:12:30| I think from Park's standpoint, and admittedly, ours would be a relational idea, not an operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| idea, but primarily through our meetings, which we have in the different areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| And we have good citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=764)|

| 0:12:53| And the command staff and the officers attend the meetings and will usually get with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| right after the meeting and work out and talk to them about issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| And I think you can gain a sense from the nature of the quarterly Park meetings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| the people there of what to feel, because usually there will be some community leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=790)|

| 0:13:44| the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=824)|

| 0:15:59| And this is a council that is very willing to dig in, to take questions, to disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| with each other honestly and openly and keep talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| And it's actually fun being the vice mayor now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| And I hope that will continue at least through the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Seeing no further, I would like to recognize former council members, Holquist and Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| It's nice to see you all back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| 8A is a resolution appointing Council Member Joe Holquist to continue his service to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| City of Knoxville as co-chair of the Committee on Transportation and Mobility requested by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| This is a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| This resolution is set up for the co-chairmanship of Joe Bailey and Joe Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| Councilman Bailey is actually going to be stepping down and Mr. Greave will be stepping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Can we amend this here or should we just – we kind of – so I'd like to amend this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| replace Mr. Bailey's name with Mr. Greave's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| And that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Yes, that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Any comments on the motion to amend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Not on the motion, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| To amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| We'll take that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| The motion to amend is –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| It's only to the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Yeah, to the – yeah, I'm – yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| Right now, then, all those in favor of amending and having Mr. Greave take Mr. Bailey's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| place co-chairing with Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Now back to the motion – or the resolution as amended – as amended, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| I just want to check with Charles or someone else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Is there a time limit to any of these appointments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| In other words, do we revisit this from time to time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| How long is the appointment for and how do we follow up on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| This is an ad hoc committee appointed by city council to perform a particular job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| So essentially, it stays in place until the job is done, unless council addresses it otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| and does away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Just to address your point, Councilman DellaVolpe, I think it probably would be a good idea to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| add terms to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Most of the committees I've been involved with have terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| So as the council members rotate on and off, they can reappoint or appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| And I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| But my main point was I just wanted to thank Councilman Holquist for he agreeing to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| as the co-chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| He started this committee and asked me to co-chair it with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| But he's really been the person that is behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| He's the foundation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| He spearheaded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| He is a great asset, very knowledgeable on these transportation and mobility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| And I think pretty soon we're going to see some recommendations and a report, possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| that we can look at and hopefully move in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| I'd just like to follow up with what Councilman Bailey said and thank former Councilman Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| for being willing to step up and continue on with that role, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| There's nobody, I don't think, that's been any more dedicated to that cause and he'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| serve very ably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| And I appreciate that and look forward to his work and his reports back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| I'd like to underscore Mr. DellaVolpe's request that may we go back to the original resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| and consider adding some terms to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And I assume, Mr. Swanson, that's not something that's appropriate within this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| But if that's something that you could bring forward, I think it does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| Although it was originally conceived as an ad hoc committee, it does seem to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| whose mission is continuing for quite a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| And to ensure the continuity of fresh voices on this committee, I'd like to revisit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| issue of terms of those appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I would ask that somebody contact me and tell me what you want me to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| I don't want to just make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| I'll just make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Mr. Holquist, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| It's not here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1237)|

| 0:20:44| I still live in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you for your kind words, especially Councilman Bailey and Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I really appreciate your confidence in me, and I will do the best I can to live up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| your expectations and the rest of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| And looking forward to taking the charge and moving on until such time as those terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| are determined and exceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Ready to vote then on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| All those in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Joe, before you leave, do you have a recommendation on a time frame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| I don't know what your horizon is on this, whether this is an ongoing and open committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| or whether it has a discrete end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Well, it could be a year, but then somebody said, as Councilman Bailey said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| so that when council turns over, those appointments can be addressed at that point, so maybe that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| the way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| You know, that's your all's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| That actually kind of makes sense, but I'm okay either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I mean, just whatever you want to do is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| But do you view it as an ongoing, like, review of transportation and mobility that won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| just have a discrete report, but a continuing activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| It's broad enough that I could see that being the case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Seeing no further lights, you're ready to vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1324)|

| 0:28:56| But I think they ventured beyond the bounds of what had been prescribed in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1736)|

| 0:29:14| the Convention Center, and then the sanction that the NPC placed on that, I think, was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| misled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1761)|

| 0:29:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1769)|

| 0:29:42| I know at least five of you here remember the months of discussion that took place last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| year regarding the regulation of EMCs, the long discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| The commendable ordinance which resulted reflected shared concerns for the attractiveness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| safety of our city, and these concerns have not changed and continue to be relevant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| You also remember the discussions regarding whether or not to exempt government-owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| signs from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Ultimately, it was felt that it wasn't fair to impose restrictions on private interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| that the city wasn't willing to adhere to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| This concern, too, has not changed and is relevant to this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| We understand that there is much concern over the financial situation of the Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| However, the Convention Center is not being asked to remove its EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| It is only being asked to adhere to the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| There is no evidence that operating two EMCs without restrictions will improve Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Center finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Scenic Knoxville believes that the best way to attract clients to the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| is to create a city that people want to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| People want to come to an attractive city, one with a unique character, and one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| doesn't look like every other city in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| And we think that translates, at least in part, to one without EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| We are particularly concerned that there are no restrictions on the way the Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Center is allowed to operate its EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| There is no hold time and no restrictions on the use of flashing, blinking, scrolling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| video, and animation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's unclear if it must restrict its illumination levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| While the Convention Center is currently using a six-second hold time, this could easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Scenic Knoxville feels that if the Convention Center is not required to comply fully with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| the current ordinance, at the least some restrictions should be specified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| We are proposing a 30-second hold time, no blinking, flashing, scrolling, animation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| or video, and compliance with the illumination levels specified in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| Given that all privately owned EMCs have to hold for 60 seconds, this seems like a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| I've spoken with Mary Bogart of the Convention Center, and she's in agreement with some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| but not all, of these restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| We also want to say that we think it's reasonable that any contracts that the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| has already signed under current EMC usage practices be grandfathered in and allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1946)|
| 0:32:33| to stand, so that they don't have to call the folks back and tell them that they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| honor the contract that they've agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1964)|

| 0:32:50| You had illumination, no scrolling, blinking, video, and a 30-second hold time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| No animation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Blinking, flashing, scrolling, video, or animation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| And 30-second hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1984)|

| 0:33:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| I would like to hear more about these signs in terms of their physical appearance, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| monument themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| They're very attractive, but the question arises, and I think Ms. Feld spoke to it very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| well, and that is, how can we as a city play the game that parents sometimes incorrectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| do and say, son, I don't want you to smoke, and give me the ashtray, I'm going to light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I mean, you can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| We need to have some example of how we operate our business that's in keeping with restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| we put on others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| And it may be that there's some compromised set of standards, but I think a standardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| approval is not healthy for our community, and it sends the wrong message to other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| that there's two different standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So I'd like to see us have some controls over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| There was a discussion in the papers about some illumination level of 500, I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| whether that's binding or just discussed as currently meeting it, and again, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| whether a 30-second hold time is the proper one or not, but the concern with this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| with electronic billboards and everything else was that we will distract drivers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| possibly cause them to be looking at the side of the road and wrecking their vehicles or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| hurting other individuals, and a six-second turnover might be enough to cause you to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| to see what the next message is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| So I think we need to look at that, and I don't know how we go about getting it corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| but I think some standard of care be applied to these signs, which the city owns, and we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:48| be a good steward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2089)|

| 0:34:51| Mr. Warhol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Speaking to one of those points, I mean, collectively we use tools that we don't allow the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| So I think, while I think it's important to set a good example, I think we frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| as a community, make a decision to use a tool collectively that we don't allow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Are there other people that are going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Right now, Mary's here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Mary, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| Scenic Knoxville mentioned that there were some items that they are requesting that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| actually agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| What Joyce and I discussed were ways that, you know, I don't disagree with what Scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Knoxville stands for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Let me first and foremost say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| While we may disagree on some of the operating standards for the EMC currently, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| to be very clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| One of the things that we thought we would, we could agree to was the static hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| We were willing to go to a variance of eight seconds on that versus the six seconds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| we are currently at as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| We were, there were a few other things we were willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| The 50%, which I believe is what the current ordinance is on the NITs, which is the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| of brightness, we were willing to come into compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Okay, so those are two things you're willing to compromise on the brightness and also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| or you're saying that these compromises won't interfere with what you think is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| for the Convention Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| First of all, I want to thank Mary and her staff for all the fine work that they do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| And when we came on council, the Convention Center was not doing as well as we would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| it would, but that debt, that annual debt has come way down and they do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2208)|
| 0:36:56| But I just want to say, you know, while I know Mary has answers to a number of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2216)|
| 0:37:05| about how you recruit business and why that is a good amenity and why that's a selling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| point, I think this is our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| It's the cities, it's the councils, it's the communities, and we don't need to necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| put Mary on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| I think it's fair for her to discuss the business aspects and the competition around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2247)|

| 0:37:37| And I think we ought to just have that, you know, if we want to ask some questions, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| got Dr. Lyons, Larry Martin, the Mayor, and of course we've talked about these EMCs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| So having said that, if Mary wants to kind of discuss the pros and the cons of how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| bring in conventions, I think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| I would like to ask Ms. Cash a question, because when we voted to remove the government exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2282)|
| 0:38:10| I think a lot, I just, that slipped through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| It did with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| And I've asked to look at the record to see how I voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| I'm not even sure how I voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I probably voted for it because we had some very lengthy, long meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| And you know, when I look at the Coliseum and the Convention Center, and how many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| these EMCs, government-owned EMCs, do we have within the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| Because I think we have some schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| We do not regulate Knox County school signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Even though they're in the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| So, that's sort of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| To the best of my knowledge, there's only those three that the city currently owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| Okay, so the Coliseum, the Convention, two at the Convention Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| I've got a question, the fact about safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| Has there been any study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| I mean, do we know if these have really caused any accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, there has been a request for the information, and we checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| There are no, nothing that we can attribute, there's actually very few collisions at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| And nothing we can attribute to the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| And I'm curious too, from a competitive standpoint, in lack markets, what, I would assume we compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| with Asheville, Nashville, Lexington, you know, we all know who it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| How many of these same facilities offer this amenity, and what does it do to you if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| don't have the ability, this tool, as they utilize it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| These facilities all have electronic message centers that fall under the government exemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Most of them do operate within a five to six second static hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| What can it do to hurt our business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| It's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I can only speak to what happened when we did come into compliance, which is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| got feedback from a lot of our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| I provided several letters that they wrote, one of which was a very vocal, Bonnie Browning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2419)|

| 0:40:30| for three more years, and she feels that that's the first welcome that her attendees have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| More, probably our show promoters who use the sign as a tool to direct parking and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| hold in our exhibit hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| We were compliant when we had to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| There were a few contracts that we did honor, but it would be hard to say if I had to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| back to a lot of these clients and tell them that we couldn't operate the EMC as an advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| tool for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| One, and you can correct me, Mr. Donaldson, if I've got this one wrong, but this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| a government exemption issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| This was a downtown design board overview, and any business, public or private, could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| have gone through the same process that the convention center did on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| The fact that this is a government sign did not impact the decision up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| I do, however, like Mr. Bailey's thought, that this really is our sign, and it's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| responsibility to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| I have a question, then, and I don't know if this is for Mr. Donaldson or a lawyer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| somebody, and it's regarding, as I understand it, the design board made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| It was appealed to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| It was appealed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| MPC just upheld, denied the appeal, and as I read the motion that was made at the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| review board, it said, motion to allow the operation of the existing signs the way they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:06| were before the regulations were adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| That seemed a little mushy to me, because there's been a couple different places we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| adopted regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| What is the sense we have right now on what the regulations on this sign are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| Because it's operated the way before the regulations were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| Do we have any clarity on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| During the discussion at the downtown design review board, we pointed out that the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2547)|
| 0:42:34| signs were actually erected and operating before the first regulations that applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| to electronic message centers back in 2003, 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:49| The convention center committed to continue to operate them as they have in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| so that was the intent of the board, I believe, was to just require them to continue operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| as they had, and as they described at the meeting, which was the six-second hold time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| was the primary parameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| So, in effect, they would be operating on the regulations that were adopted in 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| sort of, that that would be the intent of this, which was the hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| I had some experience with the sign at Henley Street, because I used to travel and hit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| stoplight almost every morning at about 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| So, I appreciated the message to know events that were going on, not only at the convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| center, but in other parts of city-owned or city-supported businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| So, from that standpoint, I personally benefited a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Not only did I know about weddings that were going to take place, but also conventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| and things that were coming into town, and I think that's an important message to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| As I worked in Sevierville, I was well aware that a new convention center was constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| there, a new convention center in Pigeon Forge, a new convention center in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| And, as we all know, if we've gone through any of those cities, sign regulation doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2644)|
| 0:44:10| seem to be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| There are many glitzy signs, and one at our convention center is not like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| But I think it would put us at a real competitive disadvantage that they have newer facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| and more ways to get out their message if we do not allow the convention center to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| with the messaging as it now is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Well, I'd like to comment both on that comment and on the general proposition, and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| the question is, what are we marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| If we're marketing Knoxville as a place to visit, to have a convention that has a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2678)|
| 0:44:44| function during the day, and a place to go either with your family or your friends to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| see what the town has to offer, whether it's restaurants, shows, or activities, one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| the things we have to offer that's different is our natural beauty, and we have to be careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| that we don't trash that in the effort to get more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| We can sell our birthrights, so I'm concerned that just because someone else is flashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| messages that that's the image that Knoxville wants to portray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2708)|
| 0:45:12| Having said that, these signs are very tasteful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| They're not unattractive as signs, but I don't still see what is the magic about six seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| versus ten seconds or some other time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Can you tell us how many messages are there on a daily basis that you're rotating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| We have removed all unnecessary frames, slides if you will, and if you were to see the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| that we host in the facility over a three to four day period of time, which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| we usually shoot for, we've been able to get it down to eight frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| So, you know, for about a minute it would take for you to watch the EMC to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| everything that was going on in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| If you're sitting at the red light, you want to know what's going on in the facility, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2753)|

| 0:46:02| versus what the current ordinance is, which is a 60 second static hold, which would mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| that you would have to watch the EMC for eight minutes to find out what events were taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| place in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| Our meeting conventions and meeting planners don't think that's of value because people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| who are going to the facility can't even see if their event is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| It does help, but by going to a minute you scooted right past the ten second hold, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| is just a longer period of time so that perhaps people will glance and then go back and pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| attention to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Do you think that would put you at some competitive disadvantage to be able to have a ten second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| delay before you change the image?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| It would impair what our competitors are doing and just the functionality and usability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| the sign itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Standing there and watching it for even that length of a time would compromise show promoters'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| ability to use it as an advertising tool to drive people to their shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| All right, well I understand your position on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| What about the other items that the young lady mentioned, animation or scrolling, flashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| lights, where do you stand on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We're willing to eliminate the flashing and blinking, the intermittent, which we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| do a whole lot of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| I would agree that we don't agree that that's attractive either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| We'd like to keep our animation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| We'd agree to moderate paced animation, but most of the international conventions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| national conventions do have animation on the spots that they provide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| I do want to thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| I know that this city depends in part on the convention center being a successful operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| but again, we are marketing our town as well as the building, and we want to be sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| we do that in a healthy way that advertises our natural beauty and our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2870)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Councilman De La Vopa, you're in good company when you say you want us to market on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| own natural beauty and strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I mean, we fought hard to create an ordinance that eliminated EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| So absolutely, we worked very long and hard on that issue, and so I share your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2896)|
| 0:48:26| But I also, in the spirit of sanity, I want to continue to support what's going on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2906)|
| 0:48:37| the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| And frankly, I imagine that the EMCs are also very productive for just the pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| the people who actually convene at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Would that be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| And so it kind of gives them an idea of that they're at the right place, and they're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| in, and they're excited about the events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| But I just wanted to point out that if you think that I'm backing away from building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| city that relies on its natural beauty, I just want to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| I didn't suggest that you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Yeah, well, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Yeah, I think I'm going to try and make a motion to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Mr. Swanson, I'm going to need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| I know this is an appeal, and my understanding is we have a lot of latitude in how we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| If we want to, I need your help crafting a motion that will say we will set conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| that sort of reach where we're at agreement now, which I think is a good place to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| which is to have the convention center sign meet the current illumination standards, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| have flashing and blinking, and have an eight-second hold time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| Can we get a motion that would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Why don't I just say I'm going to make that motion...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Ooh, that does work now, as Mr. Swanson crafts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| So that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| I think you just crafted it pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Your motion is to grant the appeal limited to those things you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| Well, I really do it well, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| And to repeat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| Grant the appeal so that essentially what MPC did remains, in effect, except that the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3023)|
| 0:50:37| brightness and illumination standards would apply, an eight-second hold time would apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| and there would be no blinking and flashing on the EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| So are you granting that appeal or denying the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Well, it sounds like you're granting the appeal because you're changing what the Metropolitan Planning Commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3050)|
| 0:50:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| But very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| Yes, that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Right now, there's not a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Was there a second down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| I want to make sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| And so animation is included, is permissible under what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| Is that right, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Under the current motion, I believe that animation would be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| But scrolling...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| No, blinking and flashing are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Blinking and flashing is prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Scrolling is not addressed, and so scrolling would not be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| And intermittent blinking and flashing is probably a better description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Paste intermittent flashing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| But so animation is allowed, and there's an eight-second hold time that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Let me just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| I actually made a motion that seemed like we had agreement on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| There are other options we can add to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| I wanted to actually ask Mr. King and Ms. Cash, who was sort of responsible for enforcing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| whether this made sense, especially the flashing and blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| My sense is those are terms that are understood within enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| but I want to make sure that we're not crafting some language that becomes hard to enforce later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| I believe we know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| Thanks, Anita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Mr. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| I wanted to ask Mary, is it possible, you talked about that you wanted to have, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| six messages a minute, or was it eight minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| We were able to get it down to eight back when we removed all public service announcements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and we removed any of the things that we were advertising that we were doing at the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| like our green initiatives, any non-essential frame we removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| We were able at that time to get it to eight frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| Sometimes when we're busier, there's going to be 12 frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| Lynn could probably speak to it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| but how many frames we've actually had to get all the events that we've had, which is a good problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| But the slowest we've been able to get it down to recently has been the eight frames,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| since we started looking even closer at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| The only frame that was non-essential that we left in was the time and temperature frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| which people were very vocal about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| They like that, and so we left that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Does that help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Well, I know you and I talked about the traffic light there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| and that sometimes it varies because of pedestrians crossing the street and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| But what's the average hold time of the traffic light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3220)|

| 0:53:44| Does someone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| We tried, I sent Lynn out, and we tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| But the minute someone pushes the button or someone gets into the turn lane to trip that signal to turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| it totally changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| So I wasn't able, I wanted that answer, too, and we were really unable to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Is it possible to have more or to increase your eight seconds to, say, 12 seconds or 10, as far as a compromise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3246)|
| 0:54:14| We would like to stick to the eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| But could you go 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Now, the sign on Henley does fall within the D1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| What's happening with the sign on Cumberland at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Currently, we are running it like the Henley sign based on the result of the MPC's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| to uphold the Design and Rewards decision, which included both the EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| It did include both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I don't see any for the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Is there any further discussion or any questions about what the motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| Could we reread the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| The motion is to grant the appeal by adopting the action of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| except that the current brightness and illumination standards would apply to these EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| There would be an eight-second hold time, and blinking and flashing signs would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3315)|
| 0:55:24| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Yeah, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| It could go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| I think everybody knows, I think, the direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Everybody comfortable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3338)|

| 0:55:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3345)|
| 0:55:46| Those no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Make it two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3348)|

| 0:55:50| Seven ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Seven ayes and two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3353)|

| 0:56:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I know that we have two people signed up to speak, I think, against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| And I know Mr. Perkins, I think, has representation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| So if you could, I'm going to go ahead, Mr. Perkins, if you could have your attorney come down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| I think that would be the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| If you could give us your name and address, please, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3407)|

| 0:56:55| If I can, at MPC, there were some challenges with the five-minute time limit, which encouraged way too many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3415)|
| 0:57:04| words to get fit in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Clearly, the rules of counsel allow each side to have three people at five minutes each for a total of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3428)|
| 0:57:15| I'd like to start out and say that we're going to give 15 minutes to Mr. Perkins' side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| I don't want to listen to that many words that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| There would be a motion to amend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| I'll second it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Could we restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| The motion is to have the, since there's only one speaker for this side, that they be allowed to take all 15 minutes of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3461)|
| 0:57:49| traditional three-by-five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| Well, that's what was moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Mr. Becker, could you explain to me more about why you are in favor of this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| Because I'm having difficulty with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| I'm in favor because at MPC, when there was a limited time given, this side tried to get too many words in and conveyed no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3489)|
| 0:58:19| information, and I don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I think this is enough of a complicated issue that I want to make sure that both sides get a chance to present their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| So traditionally we say, you know, we have occasionally set 15 minutes even for one person, and I'd like to do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3509)|
| 0:58:38| It is counsel's choice, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| That's just my sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I guess I will disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I think it's up to the wisdom of the individual presenting to be able to condense their information into a comprehensible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:56| five-minute period, and I'm not comfortable with extending the rules for one side when we don't have someone from the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| who also wants to speak for an extended length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| So I think I will not be supporting that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| I could amend that to say both sides can have 15 minutes, whether they have one speaker or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| There are two people signed up to speak for the opposing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| They get a total of 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| Again, it's counsel's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| We're going to go ahead and keep this moving along so we don't take more time discussing it than we do doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| All those in favor of Mr. Becker that would allow the speaker to speak for 15 minutes, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| And opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I heard six no's and three ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| May I address the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| One of the things that we're involved in, this is an administrative quasi-judicial procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| One of the things that you always want to make sure you do in order to allow someone to have appropriate due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| in a quasi-judicial procedure is to have an adequate opportunity to present their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| So my suggestion to you, whether or not you adopt this motion, my suggestion to you is that if you do not adopt this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3615)|
| 1:00:23| that if one side or the other side asks you to provide more time because they have been unable to make the points that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3623)|
| 1:00:35| to make with regard to their case, that you very seriously consider allowing either side who asked for it additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| In order to be fair to both sides, though, if you're going to do that, it seems to me that you probably ought to allot additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3643)|
| 1:00:50| time to each side because if it takes that long for one side to make their argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| it probably takes that long for the other side to amend their argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| Now, if what you're seeing is someone is making the same argument over and over and over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| then obviously their due process rights are not compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| But if they are rushed in making their argument or unable to make all of the points they need to make for you to understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| their position is, then I have concerns about whether or not you have compromised their due process rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3687)|

| 1:01:29| I'm going to move that we allow both sides 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| They can deviate however they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| If they don't use the time, please cede it, but let's be fair to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| Did I hear a second over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| I heard a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3702)|

| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I think what they want you to fully make your argument, but they'd like you to be as to the point as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3709)|
| 1:01:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Mr. Mayor and Council Members, this entire situation has come down to a whole lot of misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3716)|
| 1:02:06| misdirection, and miscommunication starting from the citizen up through the regulatory bodies that enforce the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3726)|
| 1:02:17| and the regulations within the city and the county and through the governing bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| Mr. Perkins operates a business called Family Building LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| I want everybody to be very clear that Family Building LLC has an address of 10913 Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3753)|
| 1:02:44| Northwest, Suite 304, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| That's a business that is incorporated within the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| He does everything he's supposed to do as a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| That business, Mr. Perkins does not have a sperm bank at his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| That is part of the miscommunication going on here, and to be quite frank about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| the media coverage is just inaccurate about all of this and is just stirring the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| Mr. Perkins simply wants the opportunity and the ability to sit in his office at home like each and every one of you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3799)|
| 1:03:30| use his phone, use his internet, use his email, use his fax machine to help run a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| Nobody's coming to his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| He's a middleman for this business, and he's been doing this for quite a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| He's involved with clients in several states, several countries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| This is just a lot of sensational things that have gotten into the paper that have just twisted this all around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| and have caused Mr. Perkins not only to lose that business, but he's a musician, a music teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| Prior to this, he had dozens of students all over the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3844)|
| 1:04:10| Now he has zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Who wants to go have their child learn the trumpet or the clarinet by the guy who has a sperm bank in his house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| That's what's resulted from all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| He's simply asking for clarification and to be allowed to use his phone, his fax machine, the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3866)|
| 1:04:38| and the rest of his computer to run his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And this business is not something hokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| It's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| There are many, many couples who cannot have a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| And his alternative is a completely open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| And I want to make everybody sure they understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| When I say open, when you deal with an adoption or a blind, anonymous egg donor, a blind, anonymous sperm donor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:13| the child created from that does not know his medical history, his or her medical history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3913)|
| 1:05:19| They won't know if they have a brother or sister somewhere out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| They won't know the critical things it takes to raise a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| Family building LLC is a completely open form of fertility alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3928)|
| 1:05:38| The children can know if they have siblings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| They can know their medical history, for example, if they need an exact match for a bone marrow transplant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| They're not looking for donor number 56792 somewhere out there in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| They know who to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| That's what this business is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| It's not some freezer in the basement of Mr. Perkins' house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| So simply put as possible, his appeal is to be able to market and operate his business from his computer at his desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3969)|
| 1:06:20| inside his home, just like many of us do every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| I think there could be questions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I don't see lights for counsel, so I'm assuming do you have anything else you want to say at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4000)|
| 1:06:47| I concentrated on the family building, but there is a second aspect to his musical career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4007)|
| 1:06:55| He does market himself for performances all across the state and the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| and I believe that that was denied as well, to be able to use his phone, his computer, and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4019)|
| 1:07:07| And that's part of the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| There are some lights, sir, if you could stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| I just wanted to ask you, did you say that no one would be coming to and from his home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| He's a music teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| He does, he was approved to have one student at a time come to his home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4044)|
| 1:07:30| and one client for the performances that he would do at his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| I just misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| I'm trying to, it's a very long packet we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| You go by Boucher, not voucher, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| Boucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Boucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Your client, MPC staff had seven conditions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| And commission didn't approve a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| Can you go through those and tell me what conditions you want real specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| Well, it's a bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| Some of it simply was not ruled upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| The MPC review, the plan that was presented to the MPC, the use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4099)|
| 1:08:29| the report of disposition, flat out said everything was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| It has zero impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| And what the MPC laid down was that Mr. Perkins was allowed to have one student at a time into his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4118)|
| 1:08:48| The seven conditions, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| There shall be no performances on site related in any way to the home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| No person other than the applicant resident may work at the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4138)|
| 1:09:06| And at the MPC, right before a vote was taken, an amendment, a motion to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| was made restricting his ability to operate the other business that we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4153)|
| 1:09:27| So you would like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4167)|
| 1:09:35| Mr. Perkins would like to be able to operate from his home, family building LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| Do you have anything specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| I mean, anything that says here's what we want to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| To be allowed to use his phone, his computer, his Internet, his fax machine to market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| operate, telemarket his business, family building LLC, and the performances in his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4198)|
| 1:10:09| To market those performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4209)|
| 1:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| Mr. Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| Mr. Mayor, I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Again, I'm not clear in my mind what the appeal is, but a couple questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4221)|
| 1:10:27| In looking at several of the Internet sites, I find that there's more than just one occupation being done at the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| What are the plans as far as the type of work that Mr. Perkins wants to do out of his house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| Mr. Perkins is a musician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| He teaches music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| That is one occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| He also is a performer at various places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| He plays music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Is that another occupation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| I would call it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| He's a musician slash music instructor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| If you do performances, isn't that different than teaching music?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| He's a musician, so I guess there's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| And the third one is the family building LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| There's three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| What about this handyman service that I find on the Internet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| I'm not aware of what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| Are there other occupations that Mr. Perkins has performed from his home prior to all of this recognition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4290)|
| 1:11:40| This appeal is about teaching music, performing music, and operating family building LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4300)|
| 1:11:49| You mentioned something about performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| What are you talking about there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Is he going to have performances in his yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Someone calls his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Mr. Perkins, we would like you to come perform for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| They could be West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| They could be in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| They could be in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| That's what the performances we're speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| What are the amphitheaters for that we read about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| Once again, that's not part of this appeal, and that has nothing to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| There is no amphitheater that we're requesting this council consider here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| Well, my concern is that you're asking for one appeal, but yet, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| there have been different occupations that have been worked out of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| And I'm just trying to get a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| Well, sir, and that's part of the problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| You're getting your information from the Sentinel and TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| That is incorrect information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| When you're interviewed on TV and you say that you're going to have performances in your yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, what am I going to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| That's not the case, and that's not what's before the council here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| We laid out exactly what we want Mr. Perkins to do in his home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| and that's operate music instruction, telemarket and market himself as a performer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| and operate family building LLC out of his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Mr. Delibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Mr. Boucher, thank you for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| You've clarified some of the points, but let me make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| The reason people are coming to the house is for music instruction, one student at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| And for a performance, is he simply marketing that on his phone, fax, whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| or is he giving performances in the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| He's marketing himself out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| He delivers those services elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| He just makes contacts at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| And the family building LLC, its operations are really at Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| and he simply does the computer and phone marketing from the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| Maintenance of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Putting someone in New York, an egg in New York, together with sperm in Los Angeles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| That's what he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| But it's not a customer come to the house thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| That's the kind of thing that might disrupt a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| but you're saying that's all just using electronic equipment that's available to anyone inside the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| It could be watching TV or it could be marketing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| It doesn't really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| It's not affecting anyone outside the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| It does not affect anyone outside the walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| And those are the things that you're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| And you're happy with the condition of one student at a time for the music instruction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| He's happy with that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Just curious of what type of music performance you are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4486)|
| 1:14:52| That I would like to let Mr. Perkins speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| I know that's weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Tell them the instruments you play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I play wind instruments, clarinet, flute, saxophone, and shofar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| I have over 10,000 hours of performances around the world, several continents, many countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| television, CDs, movie credits, play for prime ministers, royalty, hospitals, terrorist victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4512)|
| 1:15:22| I'm pro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I have another question that concerns the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Is Mr. Perkins selling instruments out of his house as part of his music business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:45| No, he does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| He does not sell instruments at the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| He may own instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| He may put something up on eBay just like one of us has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| But he does not have a shop in his house selling instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I think that's the only questions for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Signed up to speak against this are Jim Bletner and Bill Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| You all can go in whichever order you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| You'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| I'm Bill Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I reside at 430 Mellon Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| We've lived there since 1972, a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| I want everyone to listen to me clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| I think I heard the attorney for the applicant say this, and I hope you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| that Family Building LLC at Parkside Drive is a physical location of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| That's what I understand him to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Well, let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| The location of the business is this big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| It's a mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| It's at one of the private services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| It's across the street from other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| In fact, in the window when I went out there, it said the whole shop was for lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| It said the whole shop was for lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| That statement, that type of thing, is what concerns me the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| because the man will say whatever helps at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| And that's a big concern to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| I'm going to, that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Now I may come back later with our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Jim Bletner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I'm Jim Bletner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I'm speaking on behalf of the Kingston-Pack-Sequoia Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Would all of those who are here tonight in opposition to this request please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| I think what you'll notice here is that there are a lot of individuals who don't live in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| and their concern is for a lot of reasons, one being what approving telemarketing would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4684)|
| 1:18:11| We know we have the support of Bearden Council and many other neighborhood leaders from around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| I've given you a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| I'm going to try to go through it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| I know your time is valuable, and if I skip over an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| please feel free to ask me questions if you do not have the information that you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| First thing you're going to see is the petitions of those who signed who are opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| You will note in there also that there are petitions of those who had initially signed Mr. Perkins' petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4713)|
| 1:18:41| but when they got the whole story, they rescinded their signing of his petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I think that's a very important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| If you go to Section 2, those of you that have been on Mellon Drive, it's hard as heck to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| They have put concrete barriers coming out, coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| The only way you can get into Mellon from Kingston Pike is if you're coming east on Linesview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4750)|
| 1:19:19| and if you go through Sequoia Hills, the back way to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| And let me tell you, you're going to get lost if you don't know where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| because it is a securities pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Now, consequently, because of that, what's happened is that this street has virtually no traffic unless you live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4769)|
| 1:19:37| or you are coming to visit someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| There's another factor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Any traffic is going to cause an increase, and it's going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| The width of the street, 19 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| The standard width, 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Seven feet difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| So you've got a narrow street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| There's not much room for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4801)|
| 1:20:03| In fact, you can barely get an emergency vehicle down that street if someone is parked there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| You've just got enough room to meet the standard to get an emergency vehicle by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4810)|
| 1:20:17| You'll have a statement which Mr. Hill will bring up to the recorder, which is signed by the residents there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4817)|
| 1:20:24| that tell you that traffic has increased greatly there in the last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| And it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| A lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| We'll get to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Music lessons have already increased the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| That's going to increase traffic even more, if it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| And I might add that any accumulations from all these other businesses, that's just going to make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4841)|
| 1:20:50| You know, you might think we didn't appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| We opposed it, but we didn't appeal to music lessons being a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| But now we're popping all these other things on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| UPS deliveries from businesses that are there, that's going to cause problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| I also want to point out that in his request for use on review, he does say that he has an occasional visitor for his businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| He admits that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| I also think that we're looking at an occupation that becomes a real problem as far as telemarketing is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| and what the impact of that actually means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| And I'm going to ask you that tough question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| Do you really want to set the precedent of approving telemarketing in an R1 neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4897)|
| 1:21:47| Ask you that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I don't think we should have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| The other impact that is negative is the threat of this amphitheater, which it's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| They may have glossed over it, but it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| And just so that you will know, the Kingston-Pike-Sequoia Hills Association looks at each application on its own merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4921)|
| 1:22:09| We don't just blanketly say we're against this, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| We look at each on its own merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| However, let me say that I am not personally aware of any requests that KPS have ever supported for a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4934)|
| 1:22:24| Okay, now there's backup there for everything that I've said, and I want to move to the next section, telemarketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Again, I've included the telemarketing definitions there, and there's a lot of negatives involved with telemarketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| And I think you need to remember that if it's approved for this telemarketing, that this runs with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| When the next guy comes in here, he may be wanting to telemarket something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| Again, the precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| Also, you need to remember that it's regulated by the state, and telemarketing is regulated by the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| On number ten in this book, that's where you'll see the codes that apply to home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| I put it back there so you need to refer to it that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| Section four, outside workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| No more than one person other than a member of the household residing on the premise shall be engaged in such occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Well, he's not currently in compliance with the zoning codes because he has more people living there than he's supposed to have living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=4998)|
| 1:23:28| He's already been given a notice of violation for that, and so how does it become enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5008)|
| 1:23:37| I mean, if he's only allowed to have two unrelated people living in that house, and he's got seven there already, and he's allowed to have one worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5017)|
| 1:23:46| how many of these people are workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| How many of them are residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| What's the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| I can't sort it out, but I can tell you that when he's got those extra people there, it becomes very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| And I think it becomes a little more problematic, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| He's still out there advertising, and let me tell you what he's advertising for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| I'm not even sure this is legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Maybe Debbie or Ms. Poplin or Mr. Swanson could tell us this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Exhibit A or the next page there, you will see an exhibit where he talks about trading work for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:28| Six hundred-dollar pleasant room in a big house in exchange for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| Well, how do we classify that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| I think it's a very legitimate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| That ad's still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| All right, now let's move on to another item that I think begs to differ the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| You heard Mr. Perkins, through his lawyer, say that items still were offered for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| They were not offered for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Well, here, Section 5 is the items that are still offered for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| You'll see the ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| You'll talk about transcribed solos, sheet music, instruments, CDs, cassettes, and reproductive services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| Now, the reason why I bring this up is because, according to the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| only services and items produced on the site may be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| Unless medical science has changed and Mr. Perkins has figured something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| he can't sell a female gabinet out of his location where he can't arrange for it to be sold out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| because it can't be produced on site probably for another 17 or 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| I think this does not fit the question of a business that meets the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5142)|
| 1:25:51| And he talked about the music lessons and said, hey, we've got a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| everybody's going to sell a clarinet on the phone, on the Craigslist or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| Let's see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| I've got eight or nine pages of instruments that he's got for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| I think that is a business, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| And I think it's not him selling his old saxophone unless he goes through about one a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| I think it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| I know personally that he has been contacted by a lady here in town who wanted to buy a saxophone for her son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5181)|
| 1:26:27| And he says, well, I'll either meet you at my house or I can meet you someplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| So he was willing to bring a customer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| They brought about the point of the question of why the sperm bank was called a sperm bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5197)|
| 1:26:47| Better Business Bureau, Jewish sperm donor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| That's how it's entitled with the Better Business Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Jim, you all have two more minutes total for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| Let's skip to the end then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5218)|
| 1:26:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| I want to go to the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5220)|
| 1:27:01| Let's go to number nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| And you can read any of these that you want or ask me any questions about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| Does he run other businesses out of Mellon Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Yes, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| The Handyman Creative Services, which Mr. Greve referred to, there's the ad for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| You will see the phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| It's the same as Mr. Perkins' ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| He claims that he's not doing the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| But you'll see that he's got advertising still out there for the amphitheater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| advertising it as such, requests for a $10 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| It's what he had done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| I think he intends to get around the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| If you read Mr. Becker's comments, Mr. Becker's conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| you will see that there was no question at all that he intends to operate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5258)|
| 1:27:44| He was looking at ways to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| He asked, he told Mr. Becker he had made arrangements with Western Plaza for parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| He does not have clean hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| You cannot approve this when you're looking at an individual who comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| and will not even divulge to you when asked what businesses he is operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| The cumulative businesses that are there only cause more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| Each business is a major concern and will bring more traffic and more problems for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| You do have a two-minute rebuttal time, sir, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5306)|
| 1:28:32| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| I think they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Do you, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| I have a question about the amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Is that on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| He owns two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| He has three amphitheaters, as you can read there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| He has three amphitheaters, and he owns both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Now, there's one on one, and I believe that there's two on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| But each one of the two properties he owns that are contiguous have amphitheaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| And there have been outdoor concerts there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| I can't tell you whether there have or have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| I can tell you that he's advertised for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| I can tell you that he's advertised for the venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| I can tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| It's still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| And I can tell you that there's an ad where he asked for a $10 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5348)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Mr. Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Mr. Blattner, does he have outside facilities for those amphitheaters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| Yes, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| And had I had time, I would have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| I don't believe that he has proper building permits for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| I was going to ask you, did he have permits for the amphitheaters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| He has permits, what he calls for his repair work for his grading and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5369)|
| 1:29:39| So because he's got that, sometimes depending on when it's communion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| he'll refer to it as either his landscaping or his amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| But he definitely advertises it as an amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| So you're saying that he did not have building permits for the restroom facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| I have not been able to find any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| And I have a letter there from Rich Tierney, who sold the property twice, giving us pictures of what was there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| And also we have a picture off Mr. Perkins' website that shows the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| And he said that there was – Mr. Tierney said that there was no question that what he saw was not there when he sold the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5413)|
| 1:30:25| Mr. Mayor, if I can ask Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| Ms. Cash, do you know whether or not there was a building permit issued for restroom facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| outdoor restroom facilities at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| The only building permit we issued was issued on April the 18th, 2008, to do general repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| and a four-by-ten deck and stairs to a one-story single-family residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| That permit was expired with no inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| We did not give permits for an amphitheater, nor did we give permits for any restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Okay, sir, you have two minutes for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| Mr. Mayor, members of the Council, focusing what this issue is about, it's not about amphitheaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5466)|
| 1:31:15| It's not about anything else than the three things that we presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| The Neighborhood Association would like to present things, well, I heard of this, and I spoke to this person, and I spoke to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5480)|
| 1:31:30| But the fact is, the folks that did stand up here, many of them aren't even from the neighborhood, first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| Second, a vast majority of them are operating businesses out of their home to include Mr. Perkins' next-door neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5497)|
| 1:31:46| which has FedEx trucks coming in several times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| Right now, he has zero music students, so the impact on traffic in the neighborhood is pretty much zero right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5511)|
| 1:32:01| I would just ask the Council to review what the report that was presented to the MPC by its own staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5521)|
| 1:32:10| which details very, very well how much impact, which is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| Zero impact on this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| Okay, any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Yeah, I'd like to ask, sir, I mean, all these things that we've seen that have been presented here to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5547)|
| 1:32:34| that he's had on the Internet, his websites, I mean, we don't take any of that into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| I mean, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| Why is it there if it doesn't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| Handyman service, entertainment, I mean, he's obviously, he is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5564)|
| 1:32:53| advertising for more than what you're laying out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| I mean, do we just disregard that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| We are asking for approval on those three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| We're not asking for approval on anything other than those three issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| Teaching music in his home, marketing himself, and the family building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5590)|
| 1:33:18| Now, the Homeowners Association would like to use the word telemarketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| He's not running a telemarketing business out of his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| He's got two phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| There's not some army of folks calling up people with headphones on, marketing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| It's a man in his own house, in his own office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| An office that each and every one of us has in our own home to help operate our own businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| This appeal has been a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Vice Mayor Becker, I think, tried to focus the information on exactly what we were being asked to consider in the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5635)|
| 1:34:04| According to my notes, what I have heard is that the appellant would like permission to use the phone, the internet, etc., etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5644)|
| 1:34:14| primarily to operate family building LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| Mr. Swanson was kind enough to provide to us some copies of our zoning regulations to remind us within what parameters we need to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5658)|
| 1:34:31| I'm looking at section 12, home occupation, that he provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| Item number five states very clearly, there shall be no sales in connection with such home occupation other than sales of services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5677)|
| 1:34:47| products produced on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5687)|
| 1:34:51| I just can't find a way, I guess, to understand how the family building LLC service and product is being produced on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5691)|
| 1:35:03| I think Mr. Perkins' attorney has assured us that that service and that product is not, in fact, being produced on the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5703)|
| 1:35:15| And if family procreation is the primary product of this business and it's not being produced on the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5715)|
| 1:35:26| then I just don't see how family building LLC can be approved as a home occupation at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5726)|
| 1:35:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| Additional comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Mr. Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| Mr. Donaldson, I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about this home occupation as the MPC looked at it in terms of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5742)|
| 1:35:53| consider permitted in the conduct of using computers to basically advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5753)|
| 1:36:02| The staff recommendation to the planning commission was to allow the home occupation as a music teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5762)|
| 1:36:11| and the marketing of musical performances and appearances and marketing for referral service for family building subject to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5771)|
| 1:36:18| conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| And those seven conditions laid out that you have to meet all the requirements of the code, that the instruction is limited to one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5779)|
| 1:36:29| student, there shall be no performances on site that are related in any way to the home occupations, that marketing may occur via| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5789)|
| 1:36:40| internet, telephone, or mail, that no person other than the applicant resident may work at the home occupation, and that no retail sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5800)|
| 1:36:50| of any products may take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| So through these conditions, we have limited the impact on the neighborhood by limiting the new traffic induced into the neighborhood to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5812)|
| 1:37:03| only those music students who would appear one at a time throughout a day, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| Home occupations are, it's probably a bit of a misnomer as a phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| I'm a, my occupation is city planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I'm a city planner whether I'm at the city county building or whether I'm at home answering phone calls from people who are asking me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| questions about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| You carry your occupation around with you all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| What we're really dealing with is places of business in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| And I think in making its approval, the planning commission eliminated the two conditions about marketing because they just didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5857)|
| 1:37:49| It was going to be done by the resident of the house and would have no impact on the neighborhood at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| And the other conditions managed the home occupation as a music teacher to limit impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5876)|
| 1:38:06| And that music teacher function is a standard one recognized by our zoning ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| It's one of the occupations listed in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Mr. Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| I've got a question I'd like to ask Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| When you were out there and had conversations with Mr. Perkins, did he talk about doing other things besides just teaching the one student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5904)|
| 1:38:33| I mean, did he talk about any kind of performances at his place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| I, I've slept since then and I haven't watched the video myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| So I'm a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| You haven't read the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| And I've not read the transcript either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| I'm sure there are other people who've more, more recently seen what I said there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| And I suppose Mr. Blattner would be one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| And I can double check the transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| I do have a copy with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Did he talk about parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| He did talk about the idea that there was parking available someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| Did he arrange that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| So maybe I can ask the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Has, did he mention anything about making arrangements for parking for any kind of events that may occur at the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| He had a birthday party at his home over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5959)|
| 1:39:25| And parking was down so that the impact on the neighborhood for even a birthday party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| He parked all his visitors down at Western Plaza and shuttled them on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| Did he have permission to park down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| I mean, do we ever need permission to park down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| It's a private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Mr. Perkins says he had permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5990)|
| 1:39:51| That's the reason I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| It's interesting because I checked with the developer of the Western Plaza Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| And he said that he does not have any permission to park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Is Mr. Perkins asking for permission to sell instruments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| So, and party music shows is his business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| And what's its address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| 513 Mellon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| 513 Mellon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| So, he's not allowed to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| You don't want permission to do it, but he's still doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| The concern that I have in listening to not only what you have to say, but also what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| neighborhood organization has to say, is what I'm having difficulty with and in reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6057)|
| 1:41:03| the information that not only Mr. Perkins gave us, but also what the neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| gave us, there's a lot of conflict here and a lot of, in my mind, I'm speaking just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| myself, that there's a lot of conflict in terms of whether or not Mr. Perkins is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| to do what he says he's going to do and his credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| And that's why I ask about the parking situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| That's why I ask about what he's going to do in terms of other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| It's one thing to have permission to do a business and that you do that business, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| if he's going to be doing balloons and birthday parties and things like this as an occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| at his home, I think I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| I especially have a problem with someone who doesn't get proper building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| I mean, how am I supposed to make a decision based on someone's credibility if they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| gone ahead and they have these outside facilities being done that if they've not gotten the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| proper building permits and they've not even had the thing go through the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| So I'm a little concerned myself in terms of granting anything beyond what MPC has already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| done and also with the conditions they've put on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| I guess I'd ask Mr. Swanson if there's any other conditions that ought to be applied to that or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6133)|
| 1:42:18| any way to rectify some of the things that the gentleman has been asked to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| Well, the seven conditions that were named by the Metropolitan Planning Commission are conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6143)|
| 1:42:32| that go a long way toward that because we had this discussion earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| I tried to come up with a couple of other conditions that would certainly even more narrowly frame it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6157)|
| 1:42:44| and I came up with a couple of additional conditions, I think, that would be of assistance in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6164)|
| 1:42:50| And those two conditions that I came up with would be that all procedures related to the service provided by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| family building LLC shall be conducted off-site, all procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6178)|
| 1:43:07| And the next condition would be other than marketing through use of Internet, telephone, or mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| no other aspect of the family building LLC business shall be conducted on the premise of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| premises and there shall be no on-site visits to the residence by any person other than the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6199)|
| 1:43:26| slash resident. I think those would more narrowly define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6206)|
| 1:43:31| Also, because of what's been said here tonight, number four of the staff's recommendations read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6211)|
| 1:43:40| marketing, parentheses, Internet, telephone, or mail for musical performances and appearances shall be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6220)|
| 1:43:49| conducted within the residence and only one client shall be allowed on-site at any given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6229)|
| 1:43:54| Because what he said here tonight is that he does not plan to do the performances on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| He's simply marketing those performances. I would suggest, if you're going to approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| that you change that condition to say that marketing, parentheses, Internet, telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| or mail for musical performances and appearances shall be conducted within the residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| and no clients shall be allowed on-site at any given time for musical performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| So those are based on our earlier conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| If that's what council elects to do, I think those additional conditions would accomplish what's been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6267)|
| 1:44:35| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| All right, right now we do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| We don't have a motion. The appeal's going to fail if there's not a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6287)|
| 1:44:58| Okay. We will move on then. There's no motion. The appeal will fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6298)|

| 1:49:59| Do we have some kind of standard on that? Steve, do you want to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6599)|

| 1:50:40| And in doing that, do you do some kind of internal cost benefit analysis to show that this is a worthwhile way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| Well, the way we do it is we do everything that we can do with the budget and the personnel that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6647)|
| 1:50:56| Work beyond that, we have to contract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6656)|

| 1:51:08| Anything that we have to do beyond that, we don't really have the option of doing it in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| because we don't have the ability to do it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6673)|

| 1:53:28| Mr. King, I assume this is that area, based on the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| that is kind of in the great crisscross of interstate flyovers and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| and you're trying to provide a convenient and useful sort of lateral road to serve those businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| Let me first of all say that engineering and policy are working together on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6824)|
| 1:53:52| These projects resulted from an MPC study of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| The funding source was originally, this is called an HPP project, which was designated money by Congress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6836)|
| 1:54:05| and it was originally to improve the I-275 and high school area, particularly the railroad underpass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6845)|
| 1:54:15| It was determined that there really wasn't enough money to tackle that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| so we started looking at other ways to improve access to the I-275 business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| Mr. Wetzel and I worked with TDOT to change what was proposed to be used for those projects to another project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6867)|
| 1:54:40| One of the roadways that you mentioned is you might consider it a frontage road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| or an access road parallel to I-275 running from that area of ramps, as you referred to it, north along I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6886)|
| 1:54:56| And there's some additional intersection improvements that we've also gotten an okay from TDOT on to include in this project also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6896)|
| 1:55:05| Will that open up some of the brownfield that we've reclaimed out there near the Cisco Point for further development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6905)|
| 1:55:13| Well, it would help access that area around Cisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| As you know, that business park, feel free to speak any time you want to, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| It is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6925)|

| 1:55:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| One of the things we want to do all through there, Nick, is make all that a lot more accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| and that's part of the long-term plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| It's one of the close-in areas that we have that we're trying to reclaim as part of our active city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| Flat and easily accessible once we make these changes is the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=6937)|

| 2:01:45| Are you all speaking on, each of you speaking on 12-N and 12-O?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| Is that true of all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| And I take it you all are all, you have a little different interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| You all are, I just want to make certain I have all this straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| Could maybe somebody come explain just for the big picture who's doing what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| and then there are people signed up to speak for and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7326)|
| 2:02:11| Mr. Mayor, John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7331)|
| 2:02:18| I'm here on behalf of one interested owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| And Mr. Klein is here representing a bank who is, by way of foreclosure, owner of three parcels of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7342)|
| 2:02:32| There are others here, representatives of other owners who, in the large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7352)|
| 2:02:40| I guess all of the other owners currently are banks that own property by way of foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7360)|
| 2:02:47| Essentially, and I don't know how to go at this other than the way it came out of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7367)|
| 2:02:55| Essentially, there are three groupings of property that are the subject of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7375)|
| 2:03:04| The westernmost parcel is a larger parcel of some 16 to 17 acres, thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7384)|
| 2:03:12| I think we can put it up and show it on a board here more readily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7392)|
| 2:03:19| That is one group of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| Mr. King, could you clarify whether that's yours or some other property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| That is property currently owned by First Century Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7406)|
| 2:03:31| It sounds like we're moving into the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| Yeah, I was just trying to maybe get an explanation of who's what maybe first before you do all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| Thank you. Good clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| I'm not saying that nothing has been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7422)|
| 2:03:50| It's just what's been done, shown, felt like it's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| All right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| Before we get started, this one of those feels like it's one of those wonderful issues where there are more than two sides on an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7438)|
| 2:04:05| So it probably would be good to work out some ground rules on-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| Yeah, that's why I'm trying to figure out who all is representing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| Maybe if you could show us on the map who's doing what, and then we will go back and figure out the ground rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7452)|
| 2:04:17| This property here is owned by First Century Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7457)|
| 2:04:23| And are they represented here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Yeah, who's representing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| They were represented by First Century Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| That's the westernmost track for people who are on TV and can't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7479)|
| 2:04:52| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| That's the most northern track, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| Can you pull the microphone up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Yeah, just sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| I know this is awkward, but hopefully it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| The part that adjoins Mr. Klein's property that's shaded blue was a piece of property in which my client had an interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7500)|
| 2:05:10| had a contract to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| That has now been since MPC meeting, within a week of that meeting, that piece was foreclosed by Home Federal Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7512)|
| 2:05:20| And Mr. Greg Shanks is here for Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| My client, Dr. Hal Cates, and his partner own this parcel right here, the blue shaded piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7526)|
| 2:05:34| on the south side of Washington Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7539)|
| 2:05:41| I'm going to figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| Now, I have to speak against – oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| I have Kevin Murphy and Bob Wolfenbarger both signed up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| You have 12 NNO down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| And I just want to make sure I kind of – okay, I'm trying to size up who all is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Nick, did you have something you wanted to ask to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I left that light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Maybe what I'd ask each one of the attorneys doing who's representing a different interest –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| I mean, technically you all do have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| If you'd just go ahead and do that, take your time to explain how this impacts the person you're representing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| and then we'll go into Mr. Wolfenbarger and Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7580)|
| 2:06:21| Is it possible to ask Mr. Donaldson to give us a quick background on actually what it is we're discussing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7581)|
| 2:06:28| and maybe a little of the background on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| And then after he does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| then each one of the three attorneys who represent someone can present their client's issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| and then we'll have those speaking against come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| This is in response to an initial request by city council to look at this whole area as a general rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7607)|
| 2:06:55| with the intent of examining first the potential of using the planned commercial zone district for all of the properties, PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7615)|
| 2:07:08| Ultimately, at the planning commission, we had to think of it in terms of the three clusters of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7628)|
| 2:07:17| rather than this one big mass of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| So we have the western properties, the northern properties, and the eastern properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| The planning commission was able to get their hands around the zoning better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7646)|
| 2:07:32| so they actually looked at the zoning first and then crafted their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| and approval of the plan amendment after looking at the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| And that's because we have the request from the council to look at PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7663)|
| 2:07:50| When staff looked at the area and the sector plan designations already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7670)|
| 2:07:59| the shopping center one, SC1, looked like a more appropriate zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| There was already one major tract in place that had SC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| and a majority of the balance of the property was designated as neighborhood center on the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7688)|
| 2:08:16| So we, as staff, recommended the SC1 zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| Both PC1 and SC1 are planned zone districts that require development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| by the planning commission prior to any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| At the meeting, after hearing from the various representatives of the many parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7714)|
| 2:08:44| the planning commission ultimately recommended to keep the zoning that is in place intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| but to attach a variety of conditions to the various east, west, and north clusters of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7731)|
| 2:09:00| depending on which ones they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Basically, it was to prevent any clearing and grading before there's actually a development plan approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| to require a development plan prior to any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| even though they have the base C3 and C4 condition zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| So on the western tract, the large tract now owned by First Tennessee, which has SC1 as its zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7760)|
| 2:09:32| the planning commission recommended keeping that, adding the two conditions of no clearing and grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7772)|
| 2:09:40| prior to the building permit, and I have to check my notes here for the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7780)|
| 2:09:48| And a full landscaping plan, a lighting and photometric plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| and architectural elevation submitted as part of the development plan package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| So those are three sets of plans that we've been requiring people submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| as a fairly routine part of our approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| On the northern properties, the four parcels along McCampbell Road and Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7807)|
| 2:10:15| to retain the C3 zoning, but require the development plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7815)|
| 2:10:23| no clearing and grading prior to approval, the full set of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| and then a fourth condition on that one, that there be no more than two driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| to Washington Pike and or McCampbell Drive permitted from that set of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7834)|
| 2:10:40| On the eastern properties, which is currently zoned C4 with conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7840)|
| 2:10:45| keeping that base zoning in place and adding the conditions of development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7845)|
| 2:10:52| prior to any building permits, no clearing and grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| and the full set of plans as part of the development plan approval package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| So we have basically four conditions that are applied throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| One group has two, one group has three, and one group has all four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| Ultimately, all three of those tracks require development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| If you go with the Shopping Center 1 version, there is no need to amend the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| the sector plan, because SC1 already complies with both of the land use designations that are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| the general commercial and the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| If we go to the planned commercial or keep the C3 and C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| we need to amend the plan to reflect a general commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| on the northern and eastern properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| In making that motion, the Planning Commission inadvertently left off one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| So we, on our Thursday agenda, have a plan amendment on the agenda to take care of that one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7919)|
| 2:12:07| So we can get that done before your second reading if that's the path that you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| Yes, sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Just so I understand what he said, the staff was saying SC1 on all three of them or PC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| the full commission decided to keep the former zoning style of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7941)|
| 2:12:26| whatever level, C3, C4 on the other two parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7946)|
| 2:12:30| and then add the conditions to the use on review and other conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Mr. Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Mark, this property was in the county and it was brought into the city, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7964)|
| 2:12:45| It was brought into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| How were the parcels of property brought in at that time as far as zoning goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7966)|
| 2:12:54| The C3 property was assigned a C3 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| It had been CA in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| The C4, I don't recall the history on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7985)|
| 2:13:09| It ultimately was rezoned relatively recently to add the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7989)|
| 2:13:18| The conditions that are attached to the C4 parcels are that it's limited to C1 uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| plus a select group of other uses, self-storage, liquor store, and restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8004)|
| 2:13:33| That was done fairly recently and after it had been annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| The SC1 I am not familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| That was already in the city prior to the time that I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8022)|
| 2:13:46| But all of this took place within a context of discussions with neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8026)|
| 2:13:54| and representatives from various parts of the northeast county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| and the northeastern part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| There was a development plan that was shown to all of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| That's included in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| They were able to see the big picture and agree on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| as these parcels were brought into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8054)|
| 2:14:18| That's what I was curious about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| Are there substantial changes from when these properties were brought into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| from what was originally given to them as far as the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8068)|
| 2:14:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8074)|
| 2:14:35| In fact, the agreement on the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| and the plans that were shown to the neighborhood was never memorialized in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| You literally have a straight basic zone district on the northern parcels of C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8085)|
| 2:14:51| with no plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| nothing to assure that that plan that was shown to people gets developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8093)|
| 2:15:00| The same sort of path is available for the C4, the easternmost set of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| Again, there is no development plan approval required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| and it can be developed piecemeal rather than holistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| as the neighborhood was led to believe that they would under the previous ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| So where it stands right now is that it's basically you have the C3 on the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| the C4 on the east, and C4 on the west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| On the west is SC1 already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| That's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| That does require the development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| So the two parcels in the north, which is presently today a C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| and then the east, which is a C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8142)|
| 2:15:45| And what we're talking about is adding to that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Any other questions before we go to the presentations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Now, I guess, Mr. King, Mr. Klein, Mr. Shanks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| whatever word you all want to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8156)|
| 2:16:03| I'm going to try to keep this within the time constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| It's going to be very difficult, I confess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| But I'm going to try as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8170)|
| 2:16:13| I hope you all will be indulgent with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8173)|
| 2:16:21| At MPC, it was rather quickly concluded that shopping center as a zoning classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| for anything other than that piece would not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8188)|
| 2:16:35| SC talks about five to 20 buildings per site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| It's got all sorts of square footage requirements for a base tenant, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8201)|
| 2:16:48| We presented letters from an engineer that said, for example, if it was SC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| none of these parcels would comply, nor would that one, with what is required in SC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| That quickly went away in the discussion at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| And then they started moving to another approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| That's how it came out of there with planned commercial didn't work either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| because of setback issues and a number of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| and staff realized that and didn't propose that as an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8239)|
| 2:17:26| What we came out with was zoning left intact as it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8246)|
| 2:17:33| and then started, if you will, morphing onto it or engrafting onto it additional requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8253)|
| 2:17:44| I can certainly understand why there's interest on the part of all of these owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8264)|
| 2:17:51| in keeping the zoning just like it is so that they can go forward, market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| and try to develop, have something develop on these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| But it's been suggested that we speak to those properties in which each of us has an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8280)|
| 2:18:08| I'm not going to talk about this piece of vacant property out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| Other than to say I suggest that we don't need to encumber these others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8294)|
| 2:18:20| when the result will be to have more vacant properties out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| Now, the western, I call it north side of Washington Pike, west of Murphy Road, that one parcel there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8306)|
| 2:18:40| my client had a contract to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| I said at MPC that it was then subject to foreclosure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| which was in abeyance until such time as this matter was dealt with by these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8329)|
| 2:18:57| I suggested then, said then, if you will, warned if you add any restrictions to this piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8337)|
| 2:19:05| or rezone it in something else than C3, it will be foreclosed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8345)|
| 2:19:13| Those restrictions were added one week later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| It was foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| My client still would have an interest in acquiring that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| and is willing to go to the bank and talk with him about acquiring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| but only if he can utilize it for a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| That is a permitted use in the existing C3 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8373)|
| 2:19:40| Historically, my client and the seller of the property over on the other side next to Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8380)|
| 2:19:49| thought that a car wash could go there when he acquired it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| It turned out that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8392)|
| 2:19:55| There was an attempt to rezone that piece, which is C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| limited to C1 uses plus restaurant, liquor store, and many storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8400)|
| 2:20:09| We asked to rezone it to add one additional permitted use car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8409)|
| 2:20:15| That request failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| What he then said was, okay, I will develop that piece next to Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| with one of the permitted uses, restaurant and liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| and that's what he proposes to put over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| and I will take my proposed car wash development to this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| He entered into a contract to acquire to use that piece to put a car wash on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| Then comes all of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| Right now, if you put the restrictions on this piece that are proposed by what the action of MPC is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8446)|
| 2:20:57| my client will have no interest and will not pursue that proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| and it will sit there owned by Home Federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| Excuse me, but for the record, this piece is 92.01, that parcel on Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| This one, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| Those conditions as already been described impose a use on review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8476)|
| 2:21:23| no clearing or grading until that development plan has been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| and specific required submissions to accompany that use on review development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| all of which add additional cost to what has already been incurred by my client on that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8492)|
| 2:21:40| He's already spent about $35,000 just to get over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| get the engineering done to see that, yes, it can go on there, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| And if you put these further expenses on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| he has no assurance that he can ever get it approved in that use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| He has no incentive to pursue it, nor indeed would anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| No more than two driveways for these four properties, two, Washington Pike and or McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8527)|
| 2:22:18| Even Mr. Donaldson, when he gave his recommendation, says it forces a unified development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8538)|
| 2:22:28| Well, it forces a unified development between four parcels of property with different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8548)|
| 2:22:35| Nobody knows what's going to go on any of those four other than my client's proposal on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8555)|
| 2:22:42| How do you design an access to serve those four lots, if you will, from where we are right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8562)|
| 2:22:52| The other piece of property that my client has is what I refer to as on the south side of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8572)|
| 2:23:00| It's parcel 9207, the one we talked to before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| And his proposed use there is what is currently a permitted use, a restaurant and a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8585)|
| 2:23:15| And he has a substantial investment in that piece of property, both in its acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8595)|
| 2:23:20| and its original intended use as a car wash, and now its alternate proposed use as a restaurant and a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8600)|
| 2:23:29| And what the current proposal does is just add more expense on the front end on that piece of property for him to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8609)|
| 2:23:39| That is, it's, you know, that particular piece is about 8 acres, .8 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8619)|
| 2:23:56| What is, what was and currently is a permitted use for a restaurant and a liquor store is, therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| proposed to be changed to a possible use only after additional front end expense and time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8642)|
| 2:24:09| From the start of this process, from the start of the property's history in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| restaurant and liquor store has been a permitted use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| That use is proposed to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| The opponents say, no, change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| Give them the opportunity and the power, if you will, to stop any proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| That is, as to any proposed development, to put this use on review process in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8671)|
| 2:24:39| If you look at that, we talk about what somebody's expectation is in looking at a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8679)|
| 2:24:51| and what they go through to try to get a development done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8691)|
| 2:24:54| I say there is an expectation or there is expectability in property development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8694)|
| 2:24:59| And adding these conditions at this point in time, what that says to the marketplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8699)|
| 2:25:04| is you don't have the right to expect you can do any proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| If these conditions are added, what incentive exists for my client to continue to expend money for engineering costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8710)|
| 2:25:19| architectural costs, costs associated with getting loan commitments, costs for a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| continued costs associated with a use on review application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8726)|
| 2:25:30| costs of providing a lighting and photometric plan, and architectural elevations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-100309-special?start=8730)|
