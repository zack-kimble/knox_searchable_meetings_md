| 0:00:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1)|
| 0:00:31| We have a few announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| You may recall my announcement at our July 8th work session that the Joint Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=32)|
| 0:00:37| Committee would meet on July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| Shortly after that announcement, the meeting was rescheduled to Thursday, August 13th at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| 4 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=44)|
| 0:00:48| The meeting agenda has been published on the Board of Education page on the KCS website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Board members, you should have received an email reminder along with a link to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| agenda, but I wanted to be sure to remind you that the Tennessee School Boards Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| annual District East meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 15th in Jefferson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Please let Terry know as soon as possible if you plan to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=73)|
| 0:01:17| And also, the superintendent will be providing an update, a reopening update during his remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| Do we have any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=84)|
| 0:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=89)|
| 0:01:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| We have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| And now we'll have the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| A few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| A little longer report than normal, but bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| We'll get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| First, I'd like to make sure all our students and families are aware of the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=113)|
| 0:01:57| It's been delayed by another week, and we will now be on Monday, August 24th, and this will be a half a day for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| There are several reasons for this change, but one of the most pressing is the extra work required to manage our scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| In addition to creating schedules for in-person, on-campus instruction at nearly 90 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| this year we're creating class and staffing schedules for more than 18,000 students who enrolled in our virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| As you can imagine, this is a challenging task, and it's been magnified by the need to hire additional teachers for some of our virtual classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| One of our top priorities is to make sure that we provide as many courses as possible for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| In order for us to honor all the virtual course requests and to meet the requirements for graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| we will be requesting your consideration and approval of a contract next week with Florida Virtual School to supplement our course offerings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| At the present time, Mr. Dupler is reviewing that contract and I think has made his review and submitted it back to Florida Virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=170)|
| 0:02:57| so we're awaiting their acceptance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| And then as soon as we get that, we will provide it to you for your review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| At this time, the cost is estimated to be approximately $1.5 million per semester to cover about 1,300 student requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| That would be the equivalent of 55 to 65 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| Again, that's an ongoing process. The scheduling is, so we can't pin down the exact amount at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| but as we work on the scheduling, we'll get closer to the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| Again, that's 1.5 per semester, so about $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| It would be the estimated cost at this point for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| We won't know about next semester, obviously, until we get into December to see how many people wish to come back in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| and how many people wish to go through the virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| And for those of you who are not familiar with it, the Florida Virtual School is a stand-alone district recognized by the State of Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| It's been approved by the Tennessee Board of Education, State Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| and has successfully partnered with many other school districts in Tennessee in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| including Williamson County, Metro Nashville, Shelby County, and Lenoir City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| And let me say, too, if the teaching positions were available, yes, we would hire teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| but these are positions that we have no applicants for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| So it does become imperative that when we made the promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| we're going to deliver a program, a valid virtual learning program, and this will allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| The program offers 190 courses, including AP and honors courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| It offers an engaging and interactive curriculum that's available to students 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Courses are taught by a certified teacher who can provide one-on-one instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| and students can reach their teachers directly via phone, text, or email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| For our middle and high school students, teachers lead online exams and discussions-based assessments over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| Teachers also reach out to students prior to the start of the course to meet them personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| and students have an online orientation prior to the start of the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Now, again, some of our students will be taking virtual courses from our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and those that we can't provide for would be the ones that would be enrolled in the Florida virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| Students will still remain enrolled at their local school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| And as I've said before, this will be a challenging year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| and I believe we need to consider all the options available to provide students with the courses they need and expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| Delaying another week will also allow us to provide more time for training on virtual platforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| to deploy Chromebooks under our one-to-one initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| and to allow for our case managers and special education service providers to make contact with our students and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| and to deploy health equipment, including the assembly of our walk-through thermometers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Many of you, I'm not sure if you went down to the maintenance building a week or so ago to look at a walk-through thermometer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| we can actually accommodate 50, 60, 70 students a minute through the walk-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| And Mr. Oaks has ordered, I believe, 145 of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| We'll be assembling those and getting them to schools based on enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| So that should speed up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| But in addition, of course, the state is supplying personal protective equipment to all teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=378)|
| 0:06:25| and principals were supposed to submit those orders, I think, by the end of the day today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| So that equipment will be arriving as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| Our principals have and will continue to work extremely hard to juggle all the details of planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| for our staff and students' safe return during this challenging time of opening schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| I know the delay is not ideal, but my hope is that if we take a little extra time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| we can avoid some challenges that might come up down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| And I do appreciate, very much appreciate, our community's patience and grace with this delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| On a related topic, I wanted to mention that orientation for incoming 6th and 9th grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| will now be held on August 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| More details will be shared by our schools, but please make a note of that calendar change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| I'd also like to emphasize again that the district is working closely with the Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| to monitor the impact of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| Dr. Buchanan and her staff are continuing to provide us with detailed data about the spread of the virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| and certainly we're grateful for our partnership with Dr. Buchanan and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| I wanted to briefly address a specific concern that our teachers have raised about how virtual learning would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| if the district operates in the red model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| And again, at this time, KCS is planning, we're planning to open in the yellow model on August 24,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| which means that both virtual and in-person teachers will be working from their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| But as I've said before, we should all be prepared for the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| that the district may have to enter the red model at some point during the semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| If that happens, teachers will be able to work from home unless an extenuating circumstance is identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| As teachers have returned to buildings this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| I've been very encouraged to see them embracing the new procedures that we outlined in our reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| I know that practices like wearing masks, physical distancing, and temperature checks can be uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| but they're very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| I'm also happy to report in terms of attendance this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| we've varied between 99 percent and 98 percent of staff in attendance for the last three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| So certainly very encouraged by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I know our teachers want to get back in front of their students and are anxious to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| and just appreciate their attendance so far this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| And I'm sure on opening day I would not expect anything less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| I'm very grateful for the dedication of our principals and teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| and their commitment to protecting the health and well-being of our school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| I'd like to briefly highlight one of our departments here at the central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| the Department of Student Support, led by Jason Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| Look up and grin at us, Jason, with your mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| He's worked very hard this summer to ensure that our most vulnerable students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| have received the services they need through extended school year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| In doing so, they've prepared to support our students with special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| throughout the coming school year and grateful for their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| So, Jason, thank you so much for all that you do and your staff does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| to meet the needs of our students and our families with the students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| And I'll just appreciate you and all that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| And during this extra week, too, and Jason has said we're going to be in touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| our case managers and special education teachers be in touch with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| and make sure that we get off to a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| So thank you, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| And then, finally, another celebrity in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| Pleased to announce that Keith Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Keith, smile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| Our director of CTE has been named as East Tennessee Supervisor of the Year finalist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| So, yeah, congratulations, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| So Keith will now advance as a candidate for the East Tennessee Grand Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| and the Tennessee Supervisor of the Year, which will be announced later this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So, again, congratulations, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Appreciate you and all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| And, of course, you know the rest of our team that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| And let me just say again how much I appreciate all of our team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| They have worked just extremely hard over the last, well, since COVID-19 started, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| I wanted to say over the last several weeks, but it's been much longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| So this is just a great team and care a lot about our students and about our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| and making sure that everything works like it's supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| And, again, there will be challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| I'll say that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| And we'll make some mistakes, but please bear with us because we're going to do the very best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| to provide our students with the best educational opportunity that we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| And that's whether they're in person or enrolled in the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| So, Madam Chair, that concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| Any questions for the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| I'm very concerned that we are talking about outsourcing teaching jobs to Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| especially when we are concerned with the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| And this is obviously not something that is helpful to our economy, though it's a boon for Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=684)|
| 0:11:32| Anytime we're talking about outsourcing, that should be a big red flag to everyone in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=692)|
| 0:11:44| And I'm concerned that we have no applicants for these 65 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=704)|
| 0:11:52| So if we could, if someone could send to the board a list of what those positions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| that we have no applicants for, I think that would be helpful to us to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| maybe why we can't fill those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Yes, ma'am, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| And I think as of today, Scott's here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| I think 159 vacancies, 78 certified and 81 classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and we'll send you a breakdown on those by position and by school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| And so we're in predicament right now in terms of filling the positions for in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=746)|
| 0:12:35| We have some of you, maybe all of you are familiar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| We do allow teachers to teach on time card during their planned period if they so wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| We pay extra for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| And so one way we're trying to absorb and make up for the teachers that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| is to have principals to submit that information, talk to their teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| and anyone willing to teach during their planned period will pay extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| I know one school got ten teachers today, I believe, to agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| That's two and a half positions, which allows teachers to make some additional money, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| So it's really a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| It's not a good thing that we don't have applicants and don't have teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| And I want to say this, too, about the contracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| That is not what I would like to do either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| I mean, I'd rather have our own people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| But one thing, keep in mind, this whole thing is new to us, too, the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| So, you know, if we have students, you know, 18,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| I don't know how many will want to come back in person in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| But, for example, if we have a large number of students that wanted to come back in person in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| and didn't have so many that wanted to go virtual, too, this gives us some flexibility as well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| in terms of contracting it out because we can, you know, we can maneuver that so that we don't have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| we don't have more teachers or we're not paying for more teaching positions than we would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| So it does give us a little flexibility in the virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| But it is not the preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| And I want to say that, too, and I'm glad you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| That is not, outsourcing is not what I feel like works best at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| But I just feel like we're in a situation right now that this might be the best way to address that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| And hopefully, you know, Mr. Dupre, too, I think wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I would add, again, I don't have all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| You'd have to talk to our great curriculum and instruction department for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| But I can say from working on the contract draft and trying to get something established with the Florida Virtual School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| is that we're looking at a year max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| I mean, it's not, it's in no way a long-term contract at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| And along that same vein, I very strongly support the change that allows teachers, if we are on red, to teach from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=900)|
| 0:15:09| And I think that makes a large difference and may have made a large difference to a lot of the staff who has taken leave already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=909)|
| 0:15:18| So has anyone reached out to those staff members who are on leave to see if that would make a difference in whether they would stay with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=918)|
| 0:15:28| You know, let me ask Scott, Madam Chair, if I could ask Scott, can you respond for us on that, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| Teachers that are on leave, the option of coming back in terms of virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| For the, could you repeat, I apologize, could you repeat the question, Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| We have all those folks who took leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| A lot of them took leave with the understanding that they would have to be in the classroom even if we were on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| So now that that has changed, has anyone reached out to those folks to see if that would change their decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| We are in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| We recognize that being an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| I want to, you know, so we are reaching out to those folks that requested that administrative leave without pay because of that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| So we will be reaching back with them as we produce the guidance and the guidelines that's going to come along with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| to make them full aware of that and give them opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| A lot of teachers have asked me about the personal protective equipment that will actually be provided to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| Since they aren't seeing that yet, they have some doubts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Can anyone tell us what they should expect to receive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| You know, Russ, if you don't mind approaching the mic, we have provided hand sanitizer for all the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| We're still waiting on some of the brackets to mount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| We're in the process of mounting those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I think maybe you said a thousand or so of those were mounted just the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| So we're expecting those brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| They do have the hand sanitizer, even if they don't have the bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| They're being delivered this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| So that plus disinfectant will be in each classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And I think paper towels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| Paper towels will make gloves available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| State's also making gloves available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| We delivered masks in sufficient quantity for all students and teachers over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| So those should be at all the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Those are the state-issued masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| We've taken 75,000 of those out to the schools over the last several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| Let me say about thermometers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| We said the walk-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| We've provided the schools 2,100 handheld touchless thermometers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| So the walk-through thermometers are due in next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1071)|
| 0:17:56| And we'll get those put together and set up at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| But they're not a showstopper for us on being able to take temperature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| because we do have the 2,100 handhelds that have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Thank you, Mr. Ebbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| I have seen a lot of those handhelds in use in different schools this week and last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| And they are being very diligent about making sure everybody gets their temperature taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| So that seems to be going very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I have two questions about the delayed days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Why are we choosing to use inclement weather days rather than just adopting a new calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1116)|
| 0:18:44| Well, our thought process about that was to try to have the end date not change, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1124)|
| 0:18:51| whatever the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I don't have it in my memory bank in terms of the last day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| But trying to keep the last day of school as it now is, the last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| Also trying to, I know we've heard on the breaks that are pretty important to folks in terms of fall break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| and winter holidays and spring break and the days at Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| So trying to make sure that we keep all the breaks and end school like we said we would end school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| was reasoning inclement weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Also the possibility that now that we are one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| it might be that provided that folks have electricity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| we could go to actually have a red model on an inclement weather day and still have school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| So that would be one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| And I think we've got two, I believe, two in-service days, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| that we could convert to student days if we needed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| Again, not ideal, but this year has presented lots of challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| So that was kind of our thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| I think it would really do us well to consider looking at a revised calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| because we don't know what the weather will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| We never know what the weather will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| And the assumption that we would be able to go ahead with instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1207)|
| 0:20:13| assumes that every child is taking their device home and bringing it back to school every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| If we look at the times that we've canceled recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| it's been either after school is out, early in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| long after a teacher could make the decision to send those devices home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| So I think it will be quite a difficulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| especially for our youngest students to be carrying those home and back every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| with the idea that we never know what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| So they would either need pretty advanced notice that that would have to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| or they would have to have some weather days built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| And the other concern that I have with using those weather days is that in a normal school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| we have built in that extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| We've built in that instructional time that teachers are with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| so that they have the same number of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| But what we have done now is we have taken that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and teachers are still working that extra time also with no additional compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1277)|
| 0:21:27| So we're looking at teachers working about 10 extra days this year uncompensated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| and that's quite concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| So I hope we would consider a new calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| because I think that would be much easier for our families to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| instead of going week by week and trying to figure out what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| so that we could have something really solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| And let me volunteer, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I guess if you maybe get the calendar committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| if the board wishes us to take a look at that, get the calendar committee together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| and talk about this, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| If that's a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| If we could have some other board members weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I think that the biggest thing we have to go on is the survey that was done in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and changing that calendar was not popular with the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| You know, I think a lot of the public would probably say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| teachers have been being paid since March, you know, March, April, May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| and they weren't working then for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Some of them were, but a lot of them weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1361)|
| 0:22:45| So that could be an issue, you know, with the 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| I don't mind to direct a comment toward that in that we'll, if we make the change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1376)|
| 0:23:06| people are going to be unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| If we don't make the change, people are going to be unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| I can promise you that if we extended our calendar in our end date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| or if we started taking holidays away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| that our mailboxes would be as full with us doing that as anything else we might try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| I personally have not, at least in the two days the change has been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| had any emails opposing that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| So I think I do support trying to keep the calendar within its initial parameters at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| because odds are we may not be able to anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| But for right now, I do appreciate the use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Plus the fact that virtual will be an option if push came to shove, even with weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1435)|
| 0:24:05| And, again, I appreciate what Ms. Owens is saying about a lot of times, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| the kids aren't going to carry them back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| But hopefully for the biggies, a lot of times we do have notice ahead of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| when storms are coming in and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| So hopefully we can take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Yeah, I just wanted to piggyback on what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| I don't think we want to have to have kids carrying these back and forth all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| But I think a lot of times, even when I look at the flooding in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| maybe we didn't know if we were going to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Or if there is just torrential rain coming or forecasts of snow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I think that sort of should trigger teachers to send the devices home in a just-in-case situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| So I do think that that's going to have to be some training that we're going to have to do about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| because it's not something we're used to doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| But I think getting kids and teachers prepared to be able to learn from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| in a way that they have not been able to, even if they don't have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| it might be that they can come to school because there's not that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| we never know with our storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I mean, half the time we think there's going to be a blizzard and there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| And then when we don't think there's going to be anything, there's something huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| But I think if there's even just the potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| I think we need to start preparing our students to be taking their devices home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Yeah, I can support moving back to the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| My concern is there doesn't seem to be any metrics for what puts us on read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| And I hear this concern from both people that are worried about sending their children back into school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| and those that desperately want their kids back in school, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Even the ones that want their kids back in school are concerned that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| on the 23rd are we going to go to read after they've already made plans to start on the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| And I know that we're working with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| but there just seems to be other than saying that we're working closely with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| I mean, when people ask, well, how will we know, it's like, you know, what do we say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| We'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| I believe Dr. Buchanan spoke about that at the health meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Do you have any information on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I don't have any updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| I know she has cautioned us really from the standpoint that if you set up, well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| let me just say there were a couple of counties that set an eight-tenths of a percent to a one percent number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| You know, and when we researched that a little bit in Hamilton County, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1597)|
| 0:26:42| their health department had no input into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| So I'm not sure where the one percent came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| And then another county may have just used, you know, the Hamilton County model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| And so I asked Dr. Reiswick, I said in our regular phone call, please talk to Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| I'd like to know the significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| If we're going to use a number, what's the significance of eight-tenths of a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| and one percent in terms of the cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| And she said there's no significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| So, you know, it didn't seem like, well, we ought to adopt a number because if there's an outbreak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| say jails have an outbreak or say there's a manufacturing firm that has an outbreak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| and it may not even impact us, but if we set a number, then we're closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| It didn't really impact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| So, yeah, that was kind of the conversation, I think, that Jason and John had with Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| And I know we'll send this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| We've got the health department does give us some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| They look at several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| But, again, Dr. Buchanan has cautioned us, hey, any one thing may not trigger a closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| It may be a combination of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| That's not to say one thing couldn't trigger it, but it's really a difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| Like, for example, they look, here are the community health metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Three-day shift detected above a 3.0 standard deviation above a rolling mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| based on data from the previous 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| And that's looking at sustained reduction or stability in new cases for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Community-wide sustained and increased diagnostic testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| with consistent or decreased test results reporting turnaround time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| Again, a red would be a three-day negative shift detected more than 3.0 standard deviations below the rolling mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1710)|
| 0:28:38| based on data from the previous 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| And result reporting turnaround time exceeding weekly average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| So that's another metric they look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Then they look at sustained or increased public health capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| Health care system capabilities remain within current and forecasted surge capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| Sustained or decreased COVID-19 related death rate for identified positive or probable cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| Those are the metrics they're continuing to look at on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| And we'll get an updated report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| And the last time that was published, and we'll send this to you, we'll get you an updated one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| This was back several days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| But you can see there are two reds, two yellows, and a green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| And I think John looked at it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| One of the yellows shifted to green, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| So it wouldn't necessarily, it could be one of these, but it could be a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| And then in terms of our metrics, what we look at is student attendance rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| And we went back and we looked at, okay, what is, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| what has student attendance rate been when we've closed schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| So, and Scott did this, our resident math teacher did this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| So when we looked at that, an attendance rate of less than 85% for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| was something we kind of looked at as one of our metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| Also, we looked at attendance rate for teacher and school-based staff attendance rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| It's fallen somewhere less than about 88.6% attendance when we've made the decision to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1806)|
| 0:30:17| And right now, again, we don't have students, but we've got a 98% to 99% attendance rate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| Now, when we start school, that may look different, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| Also, we look at support staff attendance, and that's bus drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| I know Russ monitors that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Also, support staff attendance rate with our cafeteria workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Again, Russ in the operations area monitors that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Support staff attendance rate for custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And we've got percentages, like, for example, bus drivers, 10% absence rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| or support staff at cafeteria, 20% rate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| For custodians, 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| And we also look at substitute fill rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| If the fill rate is, I don't have my glasses on, I believe that's 65% fill rate with substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| So those, and we'll send you this information, but those are some, we consider all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| So, again, it may be a combination of those metrics when we close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| And, again, I'm not saying there couldn't be one metric that just, that does close us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| So it's, I wish it was a lot easier to explain than just to say, okay, this number, this is the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| and any time it goes above it, we're not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| But it's, you know, just, we do monitor, we do talk to the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| we do talk to Dr. Buchanan and seek her advice and her counsel, and we look at our metrics as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| So, I don't know if that helped Ms. Christy or not, but, again, we'll send this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1908)|
| 0:31:57| We'll get it updated and send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Did you have any other questions for Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Let me say one other thing while I'm talking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I want to thank the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| You know, we are scheduled to get, I think, all of our devices, and, Russ, you jump on me if I'm wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| all of our devices are going to be delivered by the 11th, I believe is the scheduled date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1932)|
| 0:32:22| So, the reason I'm thanking you is because if you hadn't taken the action that you took when you took it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| you know, we might not be in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| So, just to have all of our devices prior to the start of school is really great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| and I think all secondary devices will have been deployed by August the 14th, I believe, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1956)|
| 0:32:44| And then elementary, we'll look at starting the deployment there on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| So, hopefully that week we'll have all of our elementary students will have their device in their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| and the family so that they can turn them on, use them, and get used to them and be ready for the start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| So, thank you for your very swift action in allowing us to make that purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| So, I think there's some school systems probably that are going to be on back order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| and I'm not sure when they might get them, but y'all did great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| and I just think I need to point that out to everyone because if you hadn't done what you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| we might not be in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| So, I have one more about the contract with the Florida Virtual Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| When you say that this will be the equivalent to 55 or 65 teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| if we were to hire those 55 to 65 teachers, what would happen when this year is over with those positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| It wouldn't work out exactly that way because where we got that number is looking at all the sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| So, maybe if I'm a high school student, I might have, and John, you may have to jump in and help me here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| but I could have three classes at my Bay School, and maybe one class would be with Florida Virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| So, we just took the number of sections and just said if we were to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| that would be assuming you could take that number and put that number of students in every class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| So, I just threw that out there just to say this is what it would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| with the equivalent number of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| I hope I didn't mess that up too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| So, would we be able to guarantee them, well, if we had people to fill the positions to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2066)|
| 0:34:35| teach the classes that we need them to teach, what would happen next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| Would we be able to continue their employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| No, that would be, that was a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| That's why I say this really gives us the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| because this is our first year of providing a virtual learning program, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| and it will be really good, but, you know, we had some experience with that in the spring, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| and, you know, we're going to do the best we can with the virtual model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| but if a family is not happy with that, then in December and they want to come back, you know, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| and I don't, I have no idea what the number will be, so we know we're 18,000 plus right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| Say we're, gosh, come December we're 9,000, then, you know, with this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| then that would, we just wouldn't purchase those additional sections right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| But if we had teachers employed for the year, then, you know, you've got the teachers for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| So, and I don't want to make that sound like, hey, boy, I'm in favor of outsourcing, because I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I'm not in favor of that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I'd rather have our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| And, gosh, if we had the luxury of having more teacher applicants to choose from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| then we would have, you know, we would have done our best to staff it, you know, that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| But we just don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| And you can see by the fact that we're having to ask teachers to teach on their plan period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| just to make up in the in-person program what the, you know, what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| But that's a great point, Ms. Christie, to make, too, that, hey, gosh, if you hire those teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| what are you going to do with them if you don't need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| You know, you've got them for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| And Mr. Dupa makes a great point, too, that, hey, this is not a long-term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| We're just basically trying to work through this year with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| And, you know, like I said, I hope COVID is in our memory at some point here down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| and we can get back to normal in-person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| But, again, having one-to-one does allow us to do some other things, students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| some other opportunities to extend the school day, extend the school week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| take courses maybe they didn't have an option to take while they were in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| But I'll say it again because I've said it many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| There's nothing to replace that teacher in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| That's what works best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| And that's the model we want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| But, again, it's a different time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So I'm asking you to, you know, bear with us here and let us work through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| and try to provide our students and our families with the very best educational opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| whether they've requested in-person or virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| First thing, I want to make a comment about the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| And I know things have changed, but about, I guess it's been probably 10 days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| I heard you on the radio being interviewed by one of the local people that had a radio program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2256)|
| 0:37:48| And it was one-on-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And you got into this scenario of what if, what if you do this, what if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| And I thought you did an excellent job of explaining to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| and to anybody that might be listening that it was almost impossible to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2285)|
| 0:38:16| and have all the breaks that they desired to have and yet get out before Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2296)|
| 0:38:26| And whether you agree or disagree, you did a good job of explaining it the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| Now, in reference to what Ms. Hill said, I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| If you start changing this or changing that, we're just going to have to accept the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2321)|
| 0:38:52| that we're not going to make everybody happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| You definitely are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| And things are not going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| I almost assure you that they're not going to go exactly like we would desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| I don't know what will happen, but they won't go exactly like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| So if you can't accept that, you know, then it's going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| But I think if things are better, I think a lot of kids and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2361)|
| 0:39:31| that have chosen not to go to school now because of their fear of the unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2371)|
| 0:39:42| would really like to send their kid to an in-person situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2382)|
| 0:39:50| And, of course, with the younger grades, they tell us that the science tells us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| they're not as likely to get it, like we're 10 or under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2397)|
| 0:40:06| I think I read that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| So, I mean, in reference to that and in reference to the contract situation, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2410)|
| 0:40:21| I was late and I didn't get in on all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| But it's just not going to be whether we do the contract, whether we approve them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2425)|
| 0:40:35| or whether we reject it and go some other route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| We can do the best we can do, and that's all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| That's all Bob and the staff can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| And there is a limited number of dollars out there at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2452)|
| 0:41:01| But I would, I guess I would ask this question to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2461)|
| 0:41:15| If, for some reason, that the million-dollar contract was rejected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2475)|
| 0:41:25| or the board chose not to approve it, then what would we do at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2485)|
| 0:41:35| Well, without teaching positions, this is a number that probably can change a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| but we would have 1,100 students that we couldn't get scheduled in virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| the program that they've enrolled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| Would they be regular students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Some of them wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| They're all our students, but these are across the district, and it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| And I think today maybe the number was more like 1,400, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| That was 1,100 yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| So as we're working through schedules, that's the reason I said it's kind of a changing number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| until we get to the point of getting everybody scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| But I think there's about 1,400 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| If we didn't do this program, then we wouldn't be able to offer virtual program learning to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| like we said we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| And so this allows us to make that commitment to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| I mean, we do have people, we do have our own teachers teaching in the virtual program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| but this is the spillover, I guess, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| We can't get them enrolled because, again, the classes are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| And we have to still be cognizant of the teacher-pupil ratios even if we do virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| We can't exceed those ratios at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| Well, did we have more teachers retire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2578)|
| 0:43:03| No, we actually, when you looked at the numbers, we actually had fewer teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| If you look at leaves, resignations, retirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| this year we actually had fewer teachers in total number than the previous two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| We looked at that information, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| So, again, all the numbers are, you know, if all the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| if you could take 25 kids that would break out in even numbers, you know, you could do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| But it doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| Have we got more students overall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| No, we're about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Have we got teachers that just don't want to come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Yeah, I think there was maybe 63 took a leave of absence without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| But when you look at the total number, it's fewer numbers this year of folks who either took a leave or resigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| The way it breaks out, we'll have to collapse classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| There will be some enrollments at schools will be higher, not exceeding the ratios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| but will be higher because, again, if you had three teachers teaching a grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| and one of them goes to virtual for us, then, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| those students are going to have to be divided by, that are left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| have to be divided by two teachers in the classroom while one is teaching virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| John, maybe you can do a better job of explaining than I'm doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| You've done a very good job, but it's just complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| So I think what Mr. Thomas said is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| So if you have, and some of our schools have this, three second grade teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| and so maybe they have 20 kids each, so 60 kids total, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| So what we might have is a situation where only 10 or 15 kids in that whole grade level wanted virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| So it's not necessarily enough for them to give up a teacher to teach virtually at their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| So you still have three teachers that are going to teach live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| but instead of 60 kids, you have 45 kids now across three teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So you can't give up a full teacher to teach those 15 kids, so they have to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| So this is where we do have a bit of a shortage in some areas of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| and what this does is just magnifies the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| So an example in the high schools, we're down about five math teachers right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| just in our on-campus high schools that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| There were enough sections pushed up to the virtual program that the schools couldn't handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| that we would need nine additional math teachers to teach those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And so what that means is every high school has done the best they can to try to handle those lows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| but they still might send 10 kids from Algebra I and 15 kids from Geometry that they couldn't handle that were virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| They couldn't give a whole teacher up or a whole section up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| So all those come to a cumulative at the district level, and it would be nine additional teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| So it kind of magnifies the math teacher shortage now instead of just needing five when you're 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| What's the maximum on the virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| As far as the number of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| Well, the number of kids would be, if you're talking about per class, it would be the same as the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| the 35 in high school, the 20 and the 25 based on the different grade levels in the elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| So it's the same BEP numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Yeah, I'm familiar with the 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| Correct. So it's the same for virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Could you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| You don't have enough people if you, by going virtual, if you group kids from two schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2791)|
| 0:46:45| Especially at the elementary level, we've done, Julie and her team have done a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| If they have, say there was an elementary school that had a teacher that was teaching 15 kids virtually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| and that school gave up a teacher to be a virtual teacher still in their school, still with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| say it was second grade again, and there was another school that only had three virtual kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| then those kids are in that teacher's virtual class, so we didn't have to go hire a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| It's a little cleaner in elementary because the certifications are broader for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| and you know from being a high school teacher, the certifications play out where, to Mr. Thomas's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| you may have three of the kids, four classes could be handled by the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| and then there's one section that they couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| And where we get that a lot in high school is if there are a lot of classes where there's just one section offered at a high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| so maybe there's an AP calculus class, and maybe that class only had 14 students in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| and say if six of those choose to go virtual, then you have, you know, there's not multiple sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| so then that principal would say we're going to keep the on-campus class with eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| and these six have to go up to a district class, and that's where we start accumulating those numbers to the virtual level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Okay. Since you've mentioned that, that would be probably one class in math that you would have fewer students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2869)|
| 0:48:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| But could you take that or something else that you didn't have that many students and combine, say, 50 kids under one teacher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2881)|
| 0:48:21| You still have to be at the 35 is the max still for a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| So what the State Board of Ed didn't relax that they left it at the same BUP ratio for virtual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2905)|
| 0:48:33| Well, they never relaxed it, but, I mean, as far as I know of, but in certain situations, normal situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2913)|
| 0:48:44| if it was something that we really needed, you could get a waiver for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2924)|
| 0:48:51| And since this is such an unusual situation, and since you're doing it virtually, it looks to me like, I mean, you can't do everybody that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2931)|
| 0:49:02| but if that were the only way that you could cover it, I believe it would be worth pursuing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2942)|
| 0:49:12| and maybe as the year progressed, we could, you know, there are people hired every year after, once you get into the teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2952)|
| 0:49:24| I mean, once you get into the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| That's a good question. We actually did ask that question already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| So what the State Board allowed, the State Board allowed a, so it's based on an average, again, as you remember from teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| so you can have, you can't have over a max of 35 kids in a high school class, but your average can't be 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| So what the State Board did was they allowed, they didn't move the max for the classroom, so the max is still 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| but they did allow the average to go up to 35 instead of 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| So it was the average is 30, but the max in a class is 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| What they did relax was allowing all the average and the classes to go up to 35, but they didn't waive it past 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=2998)|
| 0:50:05| So we wouldn't be able to put 50 in a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Do they, you may not know this, probably wouldn't have any reason to, do they have the actual final say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| or is there somebody above them like the commissioner or the governor that could overrule them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| That's a good question. Actually, I didn't know the answer to that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Well, you know why, because it was unique through the, and Mr. Dupre, jump in if I'm off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| but when COVID, when it happened last spring, it usually is that the waivers go straight to the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| and that's kind of final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| But this State Board, well actually State legislators passed it to where the commissioner doesn't have total call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3039)|
| 0:50:47| The commissioner then brings their recommendation to the State Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| and the State Board of Ed approves or denies the commissioner's waivers at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| So in this case, she would have the first right to say I would approve these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| but then still has to take State Board approval for them to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| And there was a meeting about two weeks ago where that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| She brought the waivers there, and the State Board chose not to support some and to support some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| So it typically would have been the commissioner's call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| but now the legislator wrote it in to where the State Board has final say is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Is there any appeals process that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| That I'm not aware of. I'd have to look at that. I'm not bothered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| You've answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Okay. Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| I think Ms. Babb was next and then Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| Was Ms. Hill next? Okay. Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| This is also a question about the Florida Virtual School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| and I do support what you're doing, and I do understand that especially some of our areas need so many more teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3100)|
| 0:51:51| Math was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Certainly mentioned some of our honors programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| I would like some clarification because I promise you before we get home tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| there will be an email from somebody that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| I'm a math teacher and I applied for a position and I didn't get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| or whatever the position might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| and I would just like clarification that just because someone applies for a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| does not necessarily mean that they might have all the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| or be what KCS might feel like is a fit for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| So be it math or elementary or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| could you, Mr. Thomas, or Mr. Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| speak to the fact that there probably are applications sitting up there that might, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| fit one of these virtual hires but not necessarily be the right person for the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Let Scott address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| If you would, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Madam Chair, board members, that may be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3176)|
| 0:53:01| Just because you have a certification doesn't mean that you automatically will be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| There may be other factors that draw into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| I mean, one of the things that we encourage our principals to do is to look out and reach out to the references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| You can learn a lot by references.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| One of the things, you know, we encourage them to do is go beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| Look at previous employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Look at what their supervisor, their last supervisor, had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| So we do try to do a thorough process in batting people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| and I think that's important because it's critical that we have not only certified instructors in front of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3214)|
| 0:53:42| but also qualified, well-vetted teachers in front of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| And so we do try to take extraordinary measures to make sure that that's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Okay, Ms. Baldwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Yes, Mr. Thomas, I was hoping you or one of your staff could talk to you about the issue of families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| that we knew ahead of time were going to have Wi-Fi issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| and how we're working through that and how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Yes, and let me just say, too, we've talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| and we think have got on the order a number of hotspots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| I'm not sure if that order, Rusty, you know if it went through, but we're ordering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| We already had some hotspots, but we've ordered others as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| and we are asking when at deployment, too, if families have the Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| So there's been a little bit of confusion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| Sometimes families get the computer, and I think because they got the device, they have the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| That's why I was wondering how we're really, because I think the families that don't have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| are probably the ones most in need of help on figuring all this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Yes, you're asking what time it is, but I'm going to have to tell you a little bit about how we're building the watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| We've got a process in place and a contact number in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| where families who don't have Internet access can call us and we'll help work them through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| There are a number of Internet service providers in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| The one that is working with us most closely is Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| But all of the Internet service providers have a discounted rate that they can put families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| who may be economically challenged into, and that's what we're working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| and that's our first preference is to get folks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| And we've received about 150, 160 calls as of yesterday, folks identifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3339)|
| 0:55:47| Out of that number, there are probably half that actually qualify for those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| The others that called were looking for a reduced rate on the connectivity they've already got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| and that's not what the program is designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| So that's our first choice is to get you into a discounted program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| And the chamber has been working with the Knoxville Education Foundation as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| to develop ways to fund those low-cost connectivity options if families still can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3377)|
| 0:56:27| For areas where you may not have Internet service at all, we were looking at hot spots to bridge that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3387)|
| 0:56:36| and we may wind up using hot spots to bridge the gap between your ability to get low-cost Internet into your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3396)|
| 0:56:46| Because even if today we go to Comcast and say, hey, here's a person that we want in and we can fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3406)|
| 0:56:53| and it still takes two or three weeks to get things in the home and get set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| So we have on order, if I remember correctly, about 800 hot spots, and we have about 200 on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3419)|
| 0:57:08| That may or may not be enough, but, again, like everything else right now, those are back ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| So we're going to have to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| We know that there are more people out there that have connectivity issues than have called us at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3435)|
| 0:57:23| and we've been doing outreach through various entities in order to try to call this to folks' attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| so we can start getting ahead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| I really, you know, I'm a little, I wouldn't say pessimistic, maybe it's realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| I think people will call us and tell us they've got a problem once they have a computer in their hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| and are trying to get into classes and it's like, oh, this doesn't work, somebody needs to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| And that's, you know, that's when the wave will hit the rocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| and we'll have to be scrambling to try to get everybody some connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| So I don't think all of that is going to be ready to go on day one, regardless of when day one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| But it sounds like we've got some processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Are we doing anything like when they pick up the computer, having something like with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| like if you do not have Wi-Fi, call this number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| Yes, ma'am, we're asking the schools to ask that question and to get that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| and there are handouts and brochures that the IT department has been working with our partners on to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3502)|
| 0:58:29| And we've got some additional outreach efforts that we're going to take over the next several days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| Okay, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| I just want to lift up another perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| And so while I'm not a fan of outsourcing either, or especially not a school in Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| I do see the opportunity of virtual school being an opportunity for scholars that at their home-based school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3528)|
| 0:58:58| they might not have a Latin teacher, but they now can take a Latin class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And so as we move forward in this, because I don't think COVID is going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| I do believe we're going to go on red sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| We doubt we now have an opportunity to give kids options of classes that they might not have at their home-based school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| while keeping them in their home-based school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| So I look forward to KCS developing our own in-house virtual programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| and I would love to see it in a way that scholars can really take advantage of academic success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3564)|
| 0:59:31| So I just wanted to throw that perspective out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| I think we'll move to discussion of the agenda for next week's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| Do we have any questions on Contracts 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| I'll give you guys a minute to get ready there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Okay, any questions on 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| Okay, 3 or 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| We have a second reading on Board Policy D-110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Okay, Grants A or B, C or D, E or F, G or H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3612)|
| 1:00:29| Okay, and do we have any questions on Contracts A, B, or C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| Okay, and moving into regular agenda items, questions on 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3637)|
| 1:00:46| B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Okay, any questions on E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Mr. Thomas, did you want to make some comments on E, the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Just a few thoughts about this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| I know it's been a concern of our educators for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| and it's an important topic from a policy perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| But I wanted to say, first of all, that I am a supporter of state-mandated assessments for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| and evaluation for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| And I think we can all agree that if you don't measure your progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| it's impossible to know whether you're meeting your goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| and that applies to the work of education as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| As a district, we have a responsibility to our students and our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| to make sure that students are learning and growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| and it's hard to ensure that is happening without state assessment and evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| But we also have some common sense to use here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| and it seems clear to me that we simply cannot pursue state-mandated assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| and evaluations in the same way that we would during a normal school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Our teachers have a difficult job at all times, and they rise to the occasion again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| But I think it's important to consider just a few of the added responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| that will be on their plate this year because of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| For teachers who are working in our in-person, on-campus model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| many of them will be asked to take temperatures before school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| disinfect high-touch surfaces, rearrange their classrooms to support physical distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| teach while wearing a mask, ensuring that students are wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| Meanwhile, teachers who are working in our virtual learning programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| will be asked to create a new, innovative learning model basically from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| and all teachers must be prepared to teach in the virtual environment during a red model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| evaluate learning loss from our spring closure and help students catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and make sure that lessons are prepared in advance in case they need to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| And again, let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| I'm confident that our outstanding educators will overcome these challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| and that the work of teaching and learning will go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| They are dedicated, talented professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| and they're going to make sure our mission is accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| But when it comes to state-mandated evaluations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| our teachers have told me that they need some relief, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| The question, as a matter of fact, is one of our public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| What can you take off my plate this year so I can do the job that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| the very best job that, you know, that you hired me to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| So a one-year pause will free our teachers to care for their students during this stressful time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| and we know our students are going to need that care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| and to focus on increasing academic achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| while protecting the health and well-being of our school communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| As I referenced earlier, students were able to choose from two academic options this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| in-person and on-campus instruction with additional safety measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| or enrollment in our virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| This was a necessary step because of COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| but it also introduces a level of variability into our instructional process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| We will be working very hard to ensure that high-quality instruction happens in both options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| but as we implement this new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| I think it only makes sense to pause the state-mandated student testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| In addition, students will be assessed throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| to determine how much learning loss took place during the summer closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and how to address that learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Throughout the school year, teachers will address learning gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| as well as new material, and teachers, as they always do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| will provide testing to monitor their students' progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| Like all of us, I'm hopeful that COVID-19 will soon be just a bad memory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| and we can quickly return to normal rhythm both in our schools and our daily lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| including the resumption of state-mandated assessments and evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| But at least for now, I think this resolution is the right approach, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| so I would appreciate the Board's consideration of this resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| Do we have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| I'm just curious about what, and I can support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| but I would like to see what we are doing as a district, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| because for the last two years, I know when we've done your evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| we've not had any real academic data to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| I mean, if we're doing things in-house, it would be good to get updates on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| I mean, I don't, you know, I don't think it should be punitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| but I would like to see, you know, the impact this has had on students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and where they are academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| And Dr. Roswick, too, I guess, and again, we'll take this to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| and think about it a little bit more, but I guess with our REA department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| possibly we could look at, you know, at that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| So knowing this question in advance, I'd be glad to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| and see what we can come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| And, Ms. Christie, you know, that's one of the things that we do need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| as we look at the evaluation tool and really just trying to ask that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| Are there other data points that we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| regardless of whether or not we have this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| So that's what I had already had a conversation with Mr. Bolton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3976)|
| 1:06:22| about looking at some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and so we will discuss that at the retreat as we talk about that evaluation tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| I think that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Yeah, I totally support this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| and I don't know if I'm joining in with what Ms. Christie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| but I do think one of the things that I think would be good for us to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| and I'm assuming we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| is we know kids are going to be at a loss starting the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| and I know it's going to be very hard for teachers to teach what they normally have taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| but I do think it's important for us to know where we're starting with these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| I don't know that T and Reddy and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| so I think even just for us as a board to know how we are kind of doing those kind of assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| because I do feel for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| I mean, it's going to be a struggle for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| They're getting kids that have been without education, for a lot of them for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| You know, basically they went on spring break thinking they were coming back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| and then we've never come back to school again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| So, you know, I know that there are challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| I do think the T and Reddy model of testing our kids is not what we really need to be stressing about this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| but I do think it's important that we've got to figure out where our kids are that we're starting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| and where we're taking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| And I guess one other question I have is who is, and I probably should know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| but who has control over making this decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Is it the state legislature, the governor, Department of Education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| I think the state legislature, I guess, ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| I don't know if the, I mean, I guess it's a federal law, so I don't know if the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4070)|
| 1:07:57| I'm not sure about the process that the department would ask for a waiver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| or the governor would ask for a waiver or the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| I'm just curious who we're directing this towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| So, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| Thank you, Ms. Babb and Mr. Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| But the, yes, the state legislature always has that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| Of course, they could delegate that to the governor, you know, in times like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| But, yeah, I mean, you know, when there's been a waiver in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| it's certainly come from the state legislature because it is state law that these things be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Just a follow-up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| Mr. Denford, couldn't the commissioner could possibly have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| if the legislature deemed it so appropriate, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| Yes, yes, if the legislature deemed it appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| And what's happened in the past when such waivers have been granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| usually the commissioner is recommending such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| so that's always a good person to have in your corner if you're asking for a waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| I'm obviously very supportive of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| and I appreciate the work of our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| and I know that they're coming to work with concerns about safety in a difficult environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| And I think that our teachers need to be able to focus solely on remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| finding out where the kids are, making sure that they are meeting that need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| and then helping them advance to the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| And so if this is one thing that we can advocate for that will take some of that pressure off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| I have no doubt that the professional teachers that we have in our system will do an excellent job making sure that that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| that our students are growing regardless of whether there is a state-mandated test hanging over their head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| and as part of their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| So I think that we need to place trust in our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| that they will do an excellent job that we know that they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| and so I hope we can pass this resolution and advocate for them in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| So any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Ms. Babb, we will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| Ms. Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| Tanya Coates, Knox County, president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| So there are two things before I get to talk about the resolution that I wanted to come and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| I would just ask you to go back and look at, I know that it was brought up about teachers working more days in regards to students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4248)|
| 1:10:58| but we are working at seven three-fourths hours, and those days that we were bunking were for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4258)|
| 1:11:05| So if we had to use those days, those days are misaligned with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4265)|
| 1:11:11| We would never be overworking ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| At least we wouldn't allow ourselves to be overworking ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| but the students are the days that we're trying to pay back when we have snow days, those inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| So we're always trying to put back their days of instruction, not our work days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| They're already built into our, so I wanted that to be cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| But in regards, you're right, I hear a lot of great things about what I'm getting ready to talk about in regards to this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| about eliminating high stakes tests and teacher evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| The superintendent's right, you're right, at least you will be next week if you pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4307)|
| 1:11:52| The focus needs to be more on our students, not standardized tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| We have a big lift coming up on August 24th, if and when we get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| that our students need to get back on track academically, emotionally, and socially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| We don't need to focus on anything else but their needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| not the needs of state bureaucrats or anything else but the needs of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| We also cannot waste valuable time prepping for a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| TFAS, the Tennessee Value Added System, supposedly uses a three-year model to create a score for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| Over the past three years, testing has been non-existing or a debacle, if you can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| The model is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| We haven't used it in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| So let's save thousands of dollars, thousands and millions of dollars that's spent on TFAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| and put it back in the classroom and on teachers that we desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| Research also shows that trying to measure teacher effectiveness using standardized testing scores is invalid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4379)|
| 1:13:07| Now imagine using these useless and screwed scores to assign teacher scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4387)|
| 1:13:13| It's wrong in normal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| It's going to be laughable this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| And in the future, we must continue to focus on our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| Any teacher will tell you their testing needs to be reliable and valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4405)|
| 1:13:34| State tested neither this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| Because of COVID and the disruption of instruction and the suspension of the test last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| the results will be screwed and meaningless this year because our kids are stressed out as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4424)|
| 1:13:53| Accountability doesn't go away if we suspend test scores this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4433)|
| 1:14:02| Teachers and educators across this district assign grades, and we take them seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| Our grades are meaningful and the most accurate measure of teacher-assessed student assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| Let me say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Our grades are meaningful and the most accurate measure of student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4459)|
| 1:14:27| It's while leading the college, while leading colleges and universities are using grades rather than ACTs or SATs on admissions like Ivy Leagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4467)|
| 1:14:39| I implore you and I ask you and I beg you on behalf of the educators of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Trust the educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Trust your superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| We will get this job done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| We'll start with Ms. Lee for board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| Ms. Hatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| I just want to say to community members, teachers, to challenge yourself to look at different perspectives as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| For every teacher that doesn't want us to open, there's a teacher that can't wait to get into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| And for every child or parent that doesn't want to send their kids to school, there's kids that can't wait to get into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| And so I believe that's what Knox County Schools is giving the options of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| So just try to think beyond your circumstances and service the 60,000 kids that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| And as for superintendent and your staff superintendent, I want us to go with the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| I don't want us to go back to the school system that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| I think this is a great opportunity to move into a more equitable and just school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| And so I challenge the staff to think big, think beyond what we've done, and let's move with the shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4549)|
| 1:15:57| Ms. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| I have some data I'd like to share that didn't really fit anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| There's a lot of conflicting research about whether children spread COVID, how dramatic it is with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4564)|
| 1:16:13| In some countries, their research has found that children don't spread it as far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4573)|
| 1:16:20| that children who are positive aren't spreading it to their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| In other countries, the research is showing that children have massively higher levels of COVID in their bodies when they're tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4584)|
| 1:16:40| So back and forth between all of that research, which is true, we don't have a way to really know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-200805?start=4600)|
