| 2:28:47| we were trying to be very attentive to a very small subset and population of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| We're talking about one neighborhood, and we just paused our zoning plan for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8933)|
| 2:29:00| because of one neighborhood coming and advocating for themselves, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| I'm glad they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| And we all, I felt like, respected that, and we heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| And all I'm asking for is this community, a large swath of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| since 2014 and beyond, have asked this school district to measure this data and to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8957)|
| 2:29:24| And so, for this board to take the stance of, well, yeah, we're going to measure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8964)|
| 2:29:31| but we're not going to codify it, sounds like lip service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| Now, everybody can, I don't need, I'm sorry, I don't need claps at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| I just, I'm speaking to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| I want you all to understand that as one of the non-representatives in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| and having a lot of conversations over two years and serving on that committee for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| that if this board says we are not going to codify this measurement somewhere in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| I think we are alienating a large part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| And I know an hour ago we weren't doing that with a very small subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9005)|
| 2:30:11| And I would like us to act consistently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| And when we have a large part of our community lifting up an issue for years and years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9014)|
| 2:30:22| I would like us to be attentive to that and say we're going to measure it and we're going to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9022)|
| 2:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| Reverend Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| I mean, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| I thank Mr. Watson for, I'm going to call it a clarification versus a correction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| because I was not referring to a measurement, but on page two of the annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9040)|
| 2:30:49| it has eliminate disparities as number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9049)|
| 2:30:56| Yeah, one is increase student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9056)|
| 2:30:59| Two is eliminate disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Three is create a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| So on our annual plan, this is really the first page that has information on it concerning the annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9065)|
| 2:31:14| And those three target objectives, each goal is supported by three target objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9074)|
| 2:31:26| And then you have nothing to measure one of the major objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9086)|
| 2:31:33| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Logically, if you put something in your annual plan, you have a measurement of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| and also you evaluate the superintendent because he's the one who's responsible for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9100)|
| 2:31:47| And I add that he brought it in to us with it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9107)|
| 2:31:52| And so now once it gets to us, it becomes the document for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| But he brought it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| He presented it as the document he would like for us to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9121)|
| 2:32:08| So I'm just simply saying that from the perspective of approving the annual plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| and we approve the superintendent evaluation instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| I would like to say it is in number 10, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9140)|
| 2:32:30| We are evaluating some areas, you know, by student group, some achievement by student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| So we are evaluating some of that data to make sure that they're performing well from a performance side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| just not the discipline side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| I received a text from a former teacher, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| while I was sitting here that commented on some of the pressure they received around discipline numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| and that kind of thing, whether that was intended or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| This was some years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| But we are measuring some of that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9176)|
| 2:32:57| We're measuring student achievement, not necessarily the discipline side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| Just for clarification, that is on the superintendent evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| And so, once again, there is a tremendous amount of pressure, particularly in Region 5, about academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9190)|
| 2:33:22| And we measure those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| We're measuring absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| We're measuring those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| Why not measure behavior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| That's the struggle I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| Logically, is that we're measuring the things that we need to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| Why not measure them all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9222)|
| 2:33:44| Because we already are doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9224)|
| 2:33:46| Now it's just a thing of, do we evaluate the superintendent on what we're measuring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| We're not asking them to do something they're not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| They're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9233)|
| 2:33:54| At least that's what I – Mr. Superintendent, that is not –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| did you not say that you're already measuring that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9237)|
| 2:34:04| Thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9244)|
| 2:34:05| No, the measure – it is a measure that we measure as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9245)|
| 2:34:08| So you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| So why not evaluate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9251)|
| 2:34:12| Are we going to evaluate according to the objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9252)|
| 2:34:21| So is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9261)|
| 2:34:26| Ms. Coatney, will you read the motion and do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| The amended motion is to approve the superintendent evaluation instrument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9274)|
| 2:34:38| with the bullet discipline numbers by student group removed from Objective 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9278)|
| 2:34:49| Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9291)|
| 2:34:52| Ms. Zewin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9293)|
| 2:34:54| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9294)|
| 2:34:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9296)|
| 2:34:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9298)|
| 2:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9299)|
| 2:35:00| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9300)|
| 2:35:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9304)|
| 2:35:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9305)|
| 2:35:06| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9307)|
| 2:35:08| That's five yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| So we are going – board members, we are going to take about a 10 to 15-minute break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9312)|
| 2:35:17| at – I know several people have been requesting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9317)|
| 2:35:21| and we will come back for our final discussion item and public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9321)|
| 2:35:33| Order, I think we have one last agenda item, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| It's item 10G, discussion and possible action on coalition of large school systems membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9337)|
| 2:35:47| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| I would like to say a few words and then I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9350)|
| 2:35:56| We have discussed this within the last few days thoroughly twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9356)|
| 2:36:06| So I think all of us should be pretty familiar with whether we think we keep class or we go another route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9366)|
| 2:36:18| Having said that, I will make a motion to withdraw or drop out of class, if I can get a second to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9378)|
| 2:36:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| So we have a motion by Mr. McMillan and a second by Mr. Triplett to withdraw from class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9398)|
| 2:36:47| Mr. Watson, it looks like you were first up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| Sorry. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| Mr. Triplett, the other day at the work session you asked a question that I thought was a good one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9414)|
| 2:36:58| in terms of where the alignment is between the four major districts that have been represented in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9418)|
| 2:37:05| And I know we – I think the intention was Ms. Owen was going to pull together some of that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9425)|
| 2:37:11| and help us understand that, and I think it would be important to hear that as a part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9431)|
| 2:37:15| I do agree with Mr. McMillan that we have talked about this a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9435)|
| 2:37:18| but that was an unanswered question that I think is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9438)|
| 2:37:25| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| You have a folder at your seat, a Manila folder, with my homework in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9447)|
| 2:37:33| So if you'll take a second to look through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| Some of it is pretty thick, so it will go quickly, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9456)|
| 2:37:40| The first page that you have is just an e-mail from this summer that new board members would not have gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| So that's there for you and explains why – explains what the next pieces are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9466)|
| 2:37:53| So these are four words that came from class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| The first one is a piece of information that was requested during the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| It is 28 pages of all of the public chapters which passed during the last legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9483)|
| 2:38:11| I'd also note that even though this isn't really part of this, while I was pulling these things together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| I happened to run across the same thing from 2017, and at that time the print was massively larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9498)|
| 2:38:28| and we had 14 pages of bills that passed and 41 that did not, even though it was a great big print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| Now we have this little tiny print, 28 pages of bills that passed and 58 that did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9514)|
| 2:38:41| So it's notable that a lot of legislation is directed around schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9521)|
| 2:38:53| This past session, I believe there were 600 bills that were being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9533)|
| 2:38:58| So looking at these that passed and that did not, you should have quite a bit of information there to take a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9538)|
| 2:39:07| and I have not looked at the actual numbers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| The next thing that you have, and this may be in mixed order depending on where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9549)|
| 2:39:16| the next thing you have are the legislative agendas for each of our districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| So you have our local Board of Education priorities, and that should be stapled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9561)|
| 2:39:28| Those go back to 2015 just because I already had those available, so that was pretty easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9568)|
| 2:39:33| I have Shelby County going back five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| I have Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| There are three years here, but they are not clearly labeled, and that's the way they came to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9580)|
| 2:39:45| So we can see 2020 is very clearly 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9585)|
| 2:39:50| The other two, I believe, are 21 and 22, but since those are not labeled, I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9590)|
| 2:39:57| I would note here that often when we share our legislative priorities as a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9597)|
| 2:40:06| sometimes we haven't completed them, and so sometimes we share them in a draft form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9606)|
| 2:40:12| And then once that draft form has been shared, sometimes our boards never go back and give them the final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9612)|
| 2:40:19| So some of these may have been done before they were really, really complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| so that our lobbyists could go ahead and begin their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9624)|
| 2:40:29| Also, we have only two from Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| They're a little confusing because we have one from 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| but then the one for 2020-21 also had a letter with it that said that they hadn't done these in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9637)|
| 2:40:44| but clearly they had because they're those from 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| For comparison, TSBA's legislative agenda is also there, so we can compare those if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| We have last session's legislative position statements from 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| Also, Robert Yellen reached out for some clarification regarding something that I said that he wanted to be sure and correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9662)|
| 2:41:09| and that is that if we have an issue that we need them to lobby for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9669)|
| 2:41:18| and it's an issue that is maybe only us, they can do that as long as the other three districts don't have a conflicting issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9678)|
| 2:41:29| And so just for example, let's say that the legislature wanted to cause us to paint all of our school buildings green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9689)|
| 2:41:40| and we didn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| We wanted to paint all of our school buildings blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| The other three districts couldn't care either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| In that case, they would lobby for us to be able to paint our school buildings blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9709)|
| 2:41:54| So it's not something where our priorities are in conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| It's just something where we have an issue that the others don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| So in that case, they would be able to do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| If we wanted to make it so that they could only work just on those specific things in the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9728)|
| 2:42:18| and not be able to advocate for us on anything else, then we could change that in the class bylaws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9738)|
| 2:42:25| So keeping those two items kind of separate, what we're talking about right now is being a part of the coalition as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9745)|
| 2:42:32| but I understand that part of that is also how our lobbyists work within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| I did not include in here any of the emails from the last several years of class calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| but I want to be sure everyone does understand that those calls happen every Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9765)|
| 2:42:50| from the time the legislators begin their session until the time our legislators end their session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9770)|
| 2:42:57| So that call with a representative from the staff and from the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9777)|
| 2:43:04| at a minimum of all four districts, that call happens every Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9784)|
| 2:43:09| And that happens from mid-January through February, March, and until session ends in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9789)|
| 2:43:18| And I can tell you that every one of those Friday calls happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9798)|
| 2:43:22| If you would like to see any of the emails related to those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9802)|
| 2:43:28| the other thing that comes out that I thought would just be a massive waste of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| each week we get a calendar that looks very much like this one of pass and fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| And so we have all the bills that are up and which committee they're in, where they've passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9819)|
| 2:43:48| and whichever ones we are concerned with, whether for or against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| those are in red so that we can go through them easily on that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| have a discussion, answer questions, or whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9838)|
| 2:44:01| And they send those to us every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9841)|
| 2:44:04| So our staff gets those every week, and our board rep gets those every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| Those could go to everyone every week if you want to see those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9850)|
| 2:44:13| to see them more specifically or to comment on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9853)|
| 2:44:17| Also, all of our board members have access to Robert and Elizabeth whenever we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| So if you want to text and ask them a question regarding something that's coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| or call and ask them a question regarding something that's coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| that can certainly always happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| But right now we are just looking at whether to remain part of class or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| So if anyone has any questions about any of that documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9879)|
| 2:44:42| or if there's something that I haven't provided, you can let me know now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| or I can provide it later, however you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9887)|
| 2:44:51| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| Ms. Owen, I know that's a lot to turn around in two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| I appreciate you digging through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| and also sticking with our legislative agenda throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| So I want to hone in on one document and ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9903)|
| 2:45:06| So the one that says class coalition of large school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9906)|
| 2:45:09| the legislative position statements for 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9909)|
| 2:45:12| and then it lists our school systems at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| So that's 19 different bullet points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| Am I assuming correctly that this is a representation of alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| between those four districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| that these 19 bullet points represent alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| among those four districts legislatively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9927)|
| 2:45:33| Yes, it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| based on the discussions that we had in that fall and winter meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9936)|
| 2:45:41| Nothing here is anything that we have conflicting position statements on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9941)|
| 2:45:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| So that was my main question from the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9948)|
| 2:45:50| is how much do we align, and at least for 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| it looks like there's at least 19 points of alignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| and I'm sure there's nuance and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| There may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| I would not say that we have 19 points in each of our legislative agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9962)|
| 2:46:06| but some of us put that more of a narrative paragraph kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| and they have broken them out into bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| so that's where those numbers are going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| I think my question is more around intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| Whoever produced this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| their intent was to produce something where they believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| these 19 points represented alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9982)|
| 2:46:26| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| Okay, that's helpful to me, so it's not one or two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| And then I'll also reference that the cost right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9990)|
| 2:46:34| correct me if I'm wrong, is $37,000 a year, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9994)|
| 2:46:38| $37,500, and it hasn't raised in 10-plus years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=9998)|
| 2:46:49| I'm sorry, Mr. Watson, I don't have that information with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| but in the past decade, when it first started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10011)|
| 2:46:55| it was five school districts, so the price jumped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10015)|
| 2:46:57| When it moved to four, when Shelby County merged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| so I do believe it has remained at $37,500 since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10020)|
| 2:47:05| Yeah, I can't think of many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| I'm getting a little bit into Millsap's Gown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| which is what I don't tend to, but I can't imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10030)|
| 2:47:12| I can't think of too many vendors like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| service providers that don't raise their price like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| I'm not sure what their motivation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| but I think it's been a win for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| So at $37,500, that means we spend $1.62 per student, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10040)|
| 2:47:28| for the service, or for being able to be a part of class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| and to use these particular lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10051)|
| 2:47:35| I don't know, I mean, there's a lot of bills that they're addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| I mean, to me, that's a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| And then, I know, Dr. Risewood, you referenced your faith earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10061)|
| 2:47:45| I'm going to take a moment and reference my faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10065)|
| 2:47:47| So in Ecclesiastes, there's a, I think it's a truism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10067)|
| 2:47:50| I don't know that it's necessarily exclusive to being a Christian or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| but it says a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| And I think the lesson in that is that we're stronger together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| And I understand that Knox County Schools has a lot of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| that is unique to Knox County Schools that we need to be pushing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| And I do think we need to have a lobbyist who is doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| But where we have alignment, and if it's 19 points of alignment this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| and 16 next year, where we have alignment in terms of those points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10096)|
| 2:48:22| legislative points, we are stronger together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| And I think we've also identified that with TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| We've said, well, we want TSBA to continue to lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| One of the things that I like about TSBA's process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10112)|
| 2:48:35| because I got to experience it this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| is they actually vote for where that alignment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| I think one of the things that we could offer up by staying in class for the bylaws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| and I don't think it's in there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| is that when those four school systems meet at TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| that we take a vote on what those priorities are that those lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10129)|
| 2:48:55| whoever it is, Millsaps, Gowan, or whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| where we're assured to say, all right, these are the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10137)|
| 2:49:00| We don't have to guess anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10140)|
| 2:49:01| We don't have to get these sheets and say, all right, where's the alignment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10141)|
| 2:49:03| We can take a vote right then and decide where that alignment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| I thought that was a good process from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| I just can't, I again want to make sure that we're not confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10151)|
| 2:49:17| the Millsaps, Gowan, and class thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10157)|
| 2:49:19| Millsaps, Gowan, or not, I mean, whoever the lobbyist ends up being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10159)|
| 2:49:22| I just cannot rationalize how in the world we would pull out of a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| where we have 19 points of alignment, at least in 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| with the three other largest school districts in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| when I do believe that we are stronger together where we align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| Obviously, where we don't align, we don't align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| But Knox County Schools, from a legislative standpoint, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| if we pull out of class, will be weaker because we will be standing alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10191)|
| 2:49:54| Ms. Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10194)|
| 2:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| I know I'm new at this and new here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| And from my perspective, you know, we started talking about this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10202)|
| 2:50:06| and it seemed like the topic was choosing a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| and then it quickly moved to whether we were going to be in class or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10212)|
| 2:50:16| And it seems that, so there's a motion now to drop out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| And it seems like if you're going to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| that you would have a backup plan or another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| And I'm curious if that, what are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10226)|
| 2:50:29| What are we left with if tonight we vote and pull out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10229)|
| 2:50:39| Mr. Dupour, would you like to speak to the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| It was my understanding that lobbyists are professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10242)|
| 2:50:46| Is that how the county commission hired theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10246)|
| 2:50:53| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| So, yeah, that's something that we would want to look at to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10256)|
| 2:51:02| because, I mean, to my knowledge, this board hasn't gone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| and tried to hire a specific lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| But that could certainly be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10270)|
| 2:51:13| I mean, so a lobbyist may be considered, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| something we'd have to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10277)|
| 2:51:18| but may be considered a professional service similar to an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| or a surveyor or somebody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| So that may be an avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| Another avenue might be an RFP to try and get the best contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10287)|
| 2:51:34| and have somebody apply and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| But if you go that route, then you are talking two to three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10298)|
| 2:51:43| probably at the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10303)|
| 2:51:44| So that would take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| So we're going to be two to three months without this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10306)|
| 2:51:49| And so our price currently is $37,500, but that's a shared cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10309)|
| 2:51:57| or that's our cost in a shared pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| So am I to assume that it's going to be more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10320)|
| 2:52:04| to be on our own with a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10324)|
| 2:52:11| I would think that would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10331)|
| 2:52:12| That would depend upon the parameters of the lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10332)|
| 2:52:15| and, you know, yeah, I couldn't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10335)|
| 2:52:18| That would be up to the board to decide as to what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10338)|
| 2:52:21| do you want a part-time lobbyist, do you want a full-time lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| You know, those details would also need to be figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10344)|
| 2:52:27| So I'm curious if anyone has a plan of how we're going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10347)|
| 2:52:34| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10354)|
| 2:52:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| From my conversations with legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| I don't think that it does put us in a bad position to not be aligned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10359)|
| 2:52:44| these other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10364)|
| 2:52:46| I think it actually puts us in a better position because we have a lot of differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| So I don't see that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| And we can either, I think if we voted to withdraw from class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10374)|
| 2:53:01| we could also then have a motion this evening to either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10381)|
| 2:53:06| and we may need additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| I'm not sure if we have enough information to make a motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10388)|
| 2:53:10| But at that point, then we could then go down the road of hiring our own lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| And so whether we, that would be the next conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| So that would be my thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10400)|
| 2:53:24| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10404)|
| 2:53:25| I was just going to add that the last time that, well, when class hired the lobbyists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10405)|
| 2:53:31| it was an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| So that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| And I've given that RFP to Mr. Dupler to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10415)|
| 2:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| So is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10424)|
| 2:53:51| Ms. Coatney, would you read the motion and do a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10431)|
| 2:54:05| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10445)|
| 2:54:06| That motion is to withdraw from class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| The motion is made by Mr. McMillan and seconded by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10449)|
| 2:54:16| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10466)|
| 2:54:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10467)|
| 2:54:28| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10468)|
| 2:54:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10469)|
| 2:54:30| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10470)|
| 2:54:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10472)|
| 2:54:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10475)|
| 2:54:36| Ms. Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Five yes votes, three no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| So motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| So, Gary, Mr. Dupler, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10483)|
| 2:54:48| We would need to, according to those bylaws, I guess, draft a letter to the other members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10488)|
| 2:54:57| and send it no later than November 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10500)|
| 2:55:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10501)|
| 2:55:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| So we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10505)|
| 2:55:06| So, Madam Chair, would we, Mr. Dupler, do we have enough information at this point to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10506)|
| 2:55:11| know whether we would need to issue an RFP or whether it could go to the Professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10511)|
| 2:55:15| Route Service or would we need to take that up in November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| I would ask that my office can communicate or Dr. Ryswick's office can communicate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10518)|
| 2:55:28| Knox County Procurement, Matt Myers, I mean, you know, just so that we know that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10528)|
| 2:55:33| on the right footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10533)|
| 2:55:37| So would you recommend that we make a motion that includes one or the other based on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10537)|
| 2:55:41| you find out or would you prefer that we wait for November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| If you're going to make a motion tonight, just, yeah, yeah, just leave it open that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10544)|
| 2:55:49| whatever process needs to be used as far as procurement goes, that's what we would use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10549)|
| 2:55:55| or the board would use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| And then, but again, I mean, I think there's still some other details you might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| think about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10562)|
| 2:56:03| Yeah, I think we should wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10563)|
| 2:56:04| I think if you'll just get some information and we can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| We also have a quarterly work session at the end of this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10566)|
| 2:56:10| Yeah, we could vote during that, but we could get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| Get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| Yeah, but that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10575)|
| 2:56:16| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10576)|
| 2:56:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10577)|
| 2:56:20| Mr. Dupler, if we have to go the RFP route, what kind of timeline will that be before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| we can consider hiring someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| How late in the session will that put us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| I mean, again, I think they have a minimum bid time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10596)|
| 2:56:41| So, I mean, I would think that you're looking at at least a minimum of two if not three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10607)|
| 2:56:54| So, we're going to be stuck with just me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10614)|
| 2:57:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10620)|
| 2:57:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| I remember us having a similar conversation when we were considering RFP for the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| And I think we all agreed at that time that it's not the fastest way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| And so, if we end up going that route, I think we need to all be prepared to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10633)|
| 2:57:18| we're likely going to have some bit of a void for some period of time during the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10641)|
| 2:57:22| Maybe we won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| But I know when we did the superintendent search, we didn't feel like we could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10644)|
| 2:57:29| that expediently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10650)|
| 2:57:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| So, that concludes our regular agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10656)|
| 2:57:40| Ms. Henderson, do we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10660)|
| 2:57:43| We do, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| We have three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| Mr. Timothy Buss, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| Yeah, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| My name is Timothy Buss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10676)|
| 2:57:57| I've been living in Austin for three plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Thank you for having me to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| I was here in July, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, fresh from a swim at the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10681)|
| 2:58:06| There's some new faces, you know, at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10686)|
| 2:58:09| So, welcome to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| These meetings are incredibly interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| This is my second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| Tonight, I just kind of wanted to go over some of the things that I talked about in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| particularly for the new board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| So, you can see I've got two girls, a 16-year-old and a 6-year-old, who I love dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10701)|
| 2:58:26| The 16-year-old has some pretty significant learning disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10706)|
| 2:58:31| I've been heavily, I mean, I've had two to three IEP meetings a year with her teachers and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10711)|
| 2:58:38| since she was in the second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10718)|
| 2:58:40| And she's a junior at Fulton, and she still reads and does math at a fourth grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| So, she's not intellectually challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10726)|
| 2:58:48| She has learning disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10728)|
| 2:58:50| She's a pretty normal teenage girl otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10730)|
| 2:58:54| You know, I guess I know that I don't expect her to be, you know, ahead of her class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10734)|
| 2:59:02| but to me, fourth and fifth grade, something isn't working, you know, and that's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10742)|
| 2:59:11| Natalia, you know, she's a little behind because she's kind of got ELL things going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10751)|
| 2:59:16| but I think she's going to be much better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| I've been a volunteer in the system with Sue Owenby for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| and I was on the AE committee for a short period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| I just, the graphs, I just wanted to remind everybody about the disparities and the extent of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10768)|
| 2:59:36| You know, despite my own family's experience, I was shocked when I saw how widespread the problem was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10776)|
| 2:59:43| I was like, I mean, I just, I don't want to curse, but that's, I felt like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| that's the extent of how frustrated and surprised I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| I mean, we have, I think we all agree we have to do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10791)|
| 2:59:55| I've been trying to educate myself since July on the issues, and, you know, I'm ready to weigh it in a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10795)|
| 3:00:04| You guys can look at, you guys can look at my takeaways and assumptions on your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| My stakeholder, my stakeholders, I really feel strongly that it's not all up to KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10809)|
| 3:00:16| I was, I heard a little bit about the discussion at the, well, actually I listened to the discussion at the workshop last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10816)|
| 3:00:24| and I guess the, you know, you can read this too, but the main thing, you know, I've seen it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10824)|
| 3:00:30| There's lots of words that sound good and everything, and there's three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10830)|
| 3:00:37| So I'm cautiously optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| There's three things that I'm really concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| One, I'm not sure of the representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10842)|
| 3:00:44| Two, it's not open to the, as far as I'm concerned, as far as I can tell, it's not open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| and I find that completely unacceptable because this should be like the number one priority of KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10849)|
| 3:00:55| What's the basic mission of a school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10855)|
| 3:00:58| It's to get kids proficient in reading and math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| So that's all I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| Maybe I'll talk to you a couple, a little more afterwards, but thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10867)|
| 3:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| Next we have Candace Bannister.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10870)|
| 3:01:15| State your name, county residence, and three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10877)|
| 3:01:18| Candace Bannister, Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10878)|
| 3:01:20| The court's call went in your favor and our case was dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10880)|
| 3:01:23| but that does not change what happened to our son, Andrew Williams Bannister, and to our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10883)|
| 3:01:28| I'm sure you are breathing a sigh of relief, but it does not restore our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10888)|
| 3:01:32| It's ironic to me that it took you four and a half years to find fault with our filing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| In the worst year of our lives, we came to you all with our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10896)|
| 3:01:39| You launched a state-mandated investigation based on our allegation of bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| We waited in vain for a report from that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10904)|
| 3:01:47| I spoke to the Board of Education for five months in a row about my concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| surrounding the suicide death of our 16-year-old son before realizing that you all were just stringing us along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10911)|
| 3:01:57| We never received that report on the state-mandated investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10917)|
| 3:02:00| In the most difficult year of our lives, we did everything we could to get the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| about the treatment of our son by his admin, but you would not cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| So we met with an attorney because you gave us no other choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| and filed our suit one day before the anniversary of our son's death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| It is not lost on me that you did not argue the merits of our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10935)|
| 3:02:19| I can only conclude that you knew our case had merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| and that you did not want to take a chance of looking bad in the public eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10942)|
| 3:02:25| Apparently, looking bad is something that really concerns you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10945)|
| 3:02:28| and you'll avoid it if at all possible when something bad has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| I suggest if you don't want to look bad, then stop doing things that look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| Our suit was filed because you would not share information from an investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10955)|
| 3:02:39| into whether or not our son was bullied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| What does that say to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| What it said to me is that you refused to be transparent with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10963)|
| 3:02:46| about whether or not our son had been bullied by his administrator leading up to his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| I cannot tell you how disappointed I am to know that transparency continues to be an issue for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10970)|
| 3:02:56| This summer, employees received the Internal External Communications Awareness document on July 18, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10976)|
| 3:03:03| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10983)|
| 3:03:04| Please keep in mind that all emails or text messages that are sent using KCS email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10984)|
| 3:03:08| or district-issued cell phones are subject to disclosure under the Tennessee Public Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| The Communications Department regularly receives requests under the Public Records Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10993)|
| 3:03:17| for emails sent by KCS employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| These requests are often made by reporters, attorneys, members of advocacy groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=10999)|
| 3:03:24| in addition to parents, guardians, and other stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| Even in internal messages, it's important to use caution and good judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| and to refrain from speaking in ways that would reflect poorly on a school or the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| Before sending an email or text message, please take a moment to consider the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| if this message were to be made public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| Communications on personal devices can be subpoenaed in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11020)|
| 3:03:44| It is good practice to routinely delete work-related communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| I cannot speak to the legality of telling employees to delete work-related communications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| but I can tell you that it is not being transparent and optics are not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11034)|
| 3:03:59| Plain and simple, it makes you look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11039)|
| 3:04:01| You're the board of this school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| Hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| Make this system better and stop hiding things that look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11046)|
| 3:04:09| You won't look better unless you look in the mirror and see where you need to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11049)|

| 3:04:22| Mr. Sam Fitzpatrick, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| Hello, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11068)|
| 3:04:31| Madam Chair and members of the board, my name is Sam Fitzpatrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| I'm the father of four children, and three of them are in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11077)|
| 3:04:41| Next year, all four of them will be in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11081)|
| 3:04:45| And I can see that I am the last speaker at the end of a very long evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| so I thank you very much for your time and attention, and I will cut right to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11090)|
| 3:04:57| I would like to ask you, the board, and you, Mr. Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11097)|
| 3:05:01| to please reevaluate the level of Internet access that's given to students on their school-issued laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11101)|
| 3:05:08| I know you have a lot of weighty things on your plates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11108)|
| 3:05:12| but I think this is worth your attention, and I think it's worth considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11112)|
| 3:05:16| In my view and in the view of a lot of parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| students in elementary school need more limitations on Internet browsers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11119)|
| 3:05:25| if not their Internet browser removed from their laptops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11125)|
| 3:05:29| In my view and in the view of a lot of parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| students at the middle school and high school level also need more limitations on their Internet access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11131)|
| 3:05:38| specifically sites like YouTube, video game sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11138)|
| 3:05:43| At best, it's a distraction, and at worst, there's a lot of inappropriate material on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11143)|
| 3:05:50| and there's a lot of just garbage on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11150)|
| 3:05:53| And as a parent, a lot of parents, as I'm sure a lot of you who are parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11153)|
| 3:05:59| we're intentional about restricting our kids' screen time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11159)|
| 3:06:04| and limiting what they can access on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11164)|
| 3:06:07| And it's very, very frustrating as a parent when they're issued a laptop from the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11167)|
| 3:06:13| that goes against the limitations that we've set on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| And so I feel like we're working at cross-purposes with the school sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11178)|
| 3:06:22| And so what I would propose and what I'd like you to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| is maybe putting together some sort of working group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| parents, teachers, administrators, students, and gather data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| Gather data about how students are using information technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11196)|
| 3:06:40| and specifically Internet browsers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11200)|
| 3:06:43| Some things that I think would be worthwhile knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| How many hours a day are children spending on their laptops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11206)|
| 3:06:49| What are the top ten most visited websites that they're accessing from their school-issued laptops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11209)|
| 3:06:57| What are the top ten Google searches that they're carrying out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| Ask parents, what sort of common sense limitations would parents like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| on Internet browsers on their school-issued laptops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11225)|
| 3:07:08| Ask teachers, is the way that we're using laptops in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| is it more of a help or is it more of a hindrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| Because I can tell you from a parent's perspective at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11236)|
| 3:07:19| it's very, very difficult to keep our students on task and focused on their schoolwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11239)|
| 3:07:25| when at the click of a button they can be on YouTube or other sites like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11245)|
| 3:07:30| So thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| And I look forward to communicating with you more over e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11254)|
| 3:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11258)|
| 3:07:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11259)|
| 3:07:40| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11260)|
| 3:07:46| So meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11266)|
| 3:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-221005?start=11271)|
