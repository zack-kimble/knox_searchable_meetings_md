| 0:08:00| of us have been through. It can be easy or it can be very difficult. I hope that we find a way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| work together to get this done quickly given that this is probably the shortest amount of time this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| has ever been done in due to COVID. But hopefully we can all work together and find fairness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=493)|

| 0:09:23| Sure I think we just go back to back and get the presentations out of the way first and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| can have our discussions after the presentations. Okay then we're prepared to provide a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=566)|

| 0:09:49| that comes out of this this committee. Thank you Terry. Start with the website then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=589)|
| 0:10:01| This is the website that we have crafted just for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| We can start at the top where we have the redistricting Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=606)|

| 0:10:25| they don't want anyone to see. I have a tab for requesting to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=625)|

| 0:11:15| We have information on the current conditions, the number of districts, total population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| the ideal population and what that means and the overall deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=680)|
| 0:11:31| This is a map of the current conditions. At the bottom we have the same indicators and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| a few others including the compactness scores and the overall deviation. If you click on show data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=696)|
| 0:11:43| you can see information broken down by district. If you click on export to CSV you'll get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=703)|

| 0:12:06| This is especially useful for members of the public who want to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| information about where they live. You can type in your address here in the top right corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| and it will zoom in on that address. You can click next to it and it will show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=734)|

| 0:12:43| as well as PDFs of some maps that we'll cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=763)|
| 0:12:51| If I just want to add real quick, so what I recovered right off the top was that we have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| means of input for the public. So we have the request to speak mechanism then we also have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=778)|
| 0:13:06| post of comments mechanism. So our role here is to set up that capability for community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| but that's where our role will end. We're going to rely on this committee to determine what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| process is going to look like, how you're going to publicize it, how you get the word out to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| public that there may be opportunity or means for them to participate. So again we will be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| your service. You direct us on how you would like that to work but right now it's set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| so structurally people can start to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Does anybody have any questions about the website before we move on to the next presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| Did you mind giving us the website name? Yes the URL is knoxcountydistricts.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you to a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Seeing no lights can we move on to the next presentation please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=840)|
| 0:14:13| Part of the presentation is going to be a look at the existing distribution of the 2020 census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| population by district and it'll also discuss the ideal population per district as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| how the actual population varies from the ideal. So as Aubrey gets set to give her a quick overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| I'll come around and hand out these tables. They may be a little hard to see on your screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| so I got a paper copy for each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=878)|
| 0:15:08| All right thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=908)|
| 0:15:39| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=948)|
| 0:16:06| all right we've evaluated the data released by the Census Bureau for the purpose of redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=966)|
| 0:16:13| and these are the conditions and patterns that we've observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Starting with the total population, the Knox County total population for the purpose of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| redistricting is 477,857. Note that this total does not include the individuals living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| correctional facilities as was decided to exclude by the committee earlier this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| The district with the lowest population currently is district one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| and the district with the highest population is district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| This is the existing trend of density. We could see high rates of suburbanization especially in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| districts two, three, four, five, and seven or in six, excuse me. This is a continuation in trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| of migration from the city to the west and northwest parts of the county. Suburbanization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| first occurred in district two around north Knoxville and Fountain City so we can still see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| higher density there. There's still areas of very high density in the city in and near downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| Knoxville actually observed substantial growth for the first time since the 1970s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| growing by almost 12,000 people since 2010 or 6.6 percent growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1037)|
| 0:17:27| Patterns of population change support the previous points about suburbanization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| migration west, and especially northwest is visible here. Orange and red represent tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| that have lost population in the past decade. The light peach indicates tracks that have gained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| less than 100 people in the past decade and everything blue is where the population grew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| Dark blue is areas that grew by over 1,000 people. Most districts only have one or two dark blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1068)|
| 0:17:55| districts only have one or two dark blue tracks if any. District six in the northwest corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| has five dark blue tracks. We're looking at Hardin Valley, Solway, and Ball Camp especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| In fact, district six only had one track that gained less than 100 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| where they only added 65 people in the southeastern portion of Karms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| Using the redistricting data set, we're also able to look at patterns in population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| by race and ethnicity. The highest density of black and African-American population is in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| around the city of Knoxville especially within district one. The black and African-American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| population is the largest racial ethnic group other than white alone. It's seen modest growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| to 40,360 or 8.4 percent of the population. The share of the population has declined however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1122)|
| 0:18:51| from 8.8 percent in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| The next largest group is the population identifying as two or more races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| They've seen growth from 8,250 or 1.9 percent share in 2010 to 31,000 or 6.5 percent share of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| the total population in 2020. This map combines the Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| and other race populations together. This is not as much of a discernible pattern except in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| districts one through six tend to have a slightly higher population of other races reflected in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1163)|

| 0:19:37| other than white is highest in districts one through three. This is the distribution of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| the Hispanic and Latino population. It's not included in the race calculations because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| Census Bureau considers this to be an ethnicity and not a race. You can be Hispanic or Latino| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| and identify as any of the other races at the same time. The Hispanic or Latino share of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1194)|
| 0:20:01| population is higher in districts one through three. This population has also grown. It's up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| to 28,000 or 6 percent share in 2020 from 15,000 and 3.5 percent share in 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| The redistricting data release has made headlines because the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| has been growing in a more diverse way across the state and across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| And the racial ethnic minority share of the population, especially individuals who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| two or more races and individuals who are Hispanic or Latino, is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Now that we know what the population looks like, we can talk about how redistricting works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| In redistricting, arguably the most important number is the ideal population. This number is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| why this committee is here. It's the total population of the county divided by the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| of districts and it's the same value for the whole county. Each district needs to be as close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Each district needs to be as close as possible to the ideal population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| The absolute deviation is the work that we have left to do. It's the difference between the ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| population and the actual population of a district. Each district will have its own absolute deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| Relative deviation is just a district's absolute deviation divided by the ideal population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| and expressed as a percentage. Each district will have its own relative deviation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| This is used to determine the next value which is the overall deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| and it's the range from the smallest relative deviation to the largest relative deviation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| The goal of redistricting is to make each district have a substantially equal population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| and this is defined as an overall deviation of less than 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Our ideal population for Knox County in 2020 is 53,095 people. The absolute deviation column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1315)|
| 0:22:09| is the difference between the ideal population and the total population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| The next column over is the relative deviation which is that same number expressed as a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Our smallest or most negative deviation is district one at negative 7.1 percent and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| largest is in district six at 15.5 percent. So to calculate the overall deviation we take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| absolute value since it's a range of negative 7.1 so we add 7.1 to 15.5 to get an overall deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1350)|
| 0:22:38| of 22.6 and that's how we know we still have work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| And just to elaborate a little bit, what the absolute deviation means is that's how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| need to be moved. So in district one, for example, the absolute deviation is negative 3783.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| To get that district up to the ideal population as close as possible, we're going to need to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| 3700 new residents into district one. Conversely, a district like six, its population far exceeds the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1382)|
| 0:23:18| ideal. It exceeds it by over 8,000 people. To meet the state requirement on equal population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1398)|
| 0:23:27| per district, that means we have to move 8,200 people out of that district. We have to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| new district for those folks. And again, this is, you know, the core of this exercise is equal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| representation by district. The saying is one person, one vote. That's core to the mission of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1426)|
| 0:23:57| That's the end of my presentation. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| questions before we move on? Do you have any other handouts? You and I talked last week that you also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| had some other handouts that you wanted to give to the commissioners while we're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| Yes. What we brought tonight are really large format maps. We have two maps that we'll distribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1450)|
| 0:24:20| just before we leave, I guess, just not to be disruptive right now. But what we would like is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| have everyone here the opportunity to take a look at options for moving people around as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| So we have one large map that shows the district boundaries, the voting precincts within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| districts, and then the population in each voting district. So you can get a rough idea of if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| going to move precinct 99 into a new district, how many people are you taking out of one district and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| putting in another? It's an exercise that you'll be able to take a shot at at home. And then we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| a second map that's, I think it's a little more detailed. I think it's got more of the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| data on it. I don't recall exactly on it, but they both will help you do that type of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| Just as a follow-up also, the table that we handed out just a moment ago, it's on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| So you'll always have that at your disposal. And there's another table on the website that has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| precinct by precinct population and its district assignments. So again, you'll have all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| necessary numbers to do some of these scenario building exercises if you so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| When we got to talk last week, I also asked about the state interactive map. Do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| follow-up on that yet or no? On the state's map? You said the comptroller at one point was talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| about releasing a map that was interactive in September. Right, that's not going to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| until, it's my understanding around September 30th, correct Alex? Okay. Yeah, it's around September 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| The short story is the early release of data that we grabbed on August 12th, that's for the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| advanced users of this type of data. This is an area that we have a fair amount of expertise in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| The more user-friendly, simpler form of the data doesn't come out until September 30th. And you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| know, we're on a real tight time frame here, so we needed to get a head start. By September 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| we'll be happy to grab that tool for you if you feel like that's going to be something of utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| for this committee. But I would say by September 30th, we are going to be well into scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| development and it may be too late for that comptroller tool. Awesome, thanks sir. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| going down the list, Mr. Law Director, was there anything that you wanted to add? I saw on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| there was a review of legal requirements. Just very short, obviously the one guiding factor we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1609)|
| 0:26:58| got is Baker v. Carr case, came out of Tennessee in 1963. That's the one person, one vote standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| and that's what we're talking about. The second thing is, here there's a requirement under our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| statute for compact contiguity, they call it, of territory. If you've got a flat place like out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| Nebraska, it's a little easier where you've got county roads, but we don't. We've got rivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| we've got mountains, we've got all kinds of delineations which have to come into the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| And as pointed out, there's a 10% deviation that's allowed from the one man, one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| And that's something that can be considered. The other most important, or one of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| important things is, and it's very difficult, excuse me, is you cannot in any way gerrymander| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| or fool around with districts that would in any way impact any racial minority within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1673)|
| 0:28:03| And so that's something just looking at this chart that you all have to look at and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| That's under the Federal Voting Rights Act and that's very strictly adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1689)|
| 0:28:16| So as you see, there's all these deviations in here. It's going to be a heck of a job for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| all and of course the planning people have got all this information, but ultimately by January 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| 2022, county commission has to come up with an ordinance setting these districts. Also within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| the districts, you have to set the precincts. And as pointed out, you could lift one precinct into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| another, but you can't have a precinct that is divided by a district line. So that's the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| thing. Once you get your districts in, you've got to make your precincts in. That's the short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| sweet, and simple in the handouts you got from the comptroller. Very, very good. Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| It tells you about everything you need to know. So with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Commissioner Durrett, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you, Chairman. Would it be possible for us to get an electronic copy of this presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| Yes, we can send out a copy of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Is that content you would like to see on that web page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1763)|
| 0:29:32| I haven't looked yet. I just like the explanation of the absolute deviations versus relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| deviations and et cetera. Okay. We'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1777)|
| 0:29:45| Commissioner Bealy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| I have two questions. As part of the redistricting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1790)|
| 0:29:56| can the number of commissioners be changed and can the number of districts be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| There's a thing we're waiting on in attorney general opinion. The question was brought up by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| Jessica Jernigan Johnson in the memo she sent out to all of you all. The statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| says that county commissions can change, increase, decrease whatever districts. Our charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1819)|
| 0:30:27| we've got nine geographic districts and two at large. Therein, the question is, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| if commission wanted to go to 11 geographic districts, i.e. take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| at large out and make them geographic districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| except for our charter, you could easily do that. You just pass an ordinance doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| But the question is, since we're a charter county, can we do that? The question has been submitted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| Dave Wright to give to the attorney general. Now, Jessica, who's very bright in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| opined that she thought that you couldn't do that without changing the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| which makes sense to me. So if that answers the complex question. Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| Schoonmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Davis, based on the comments from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| are your precincts now to the population that they should be for us to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1886)|
| 0:31:33| redistricting? We have 89 precincts in Knox County. As I've shared with a handful of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| certainly, and have shared over the past few months and even years, we have approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| 16 precincts that are in excess of 6,000 registered voters. I'm using the word voters. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| population. That's outside my scope of expertise, if you will. And state law, specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| 26103, outlines the fact that precincts where practicable should not be more than 6,000 voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1919)|
| 0:32:07| Now, if it gets, you know, a little over 6,000, it's manageable. But when we get some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| like in the Farragut's, which we split up, I'll remind everybody, four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| and you nod your head, you probably know full well, some of those are now in excess of 8,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| and 9,000 people, which is just people pouring into these places. Halls, Powell, Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| certainly up in the Northwest Corridor as well, we're seeing large numbers of voters. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| whether we do it sooner or later, later being not much later, we're going to have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| we being the Election Commission, are going to have to split up some of those precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| It doesn't necessarily lend itself to being more polling places, but it does mean we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| have to split up those precincts because some of those are just huge, and they've grown, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| just in the last three or four years. Does that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Yes, and so, in other words, we do have to maintain the integrity of that precinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| in that commission district. You can create as many precincts within that district. That's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| of what your job is, and to meet the requirements that Chris is talking about, if you need to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| more precincts within a given district, you can do it to meet that 6,000, which is still a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| Right, but you cannot, like you said, cannot split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| You can't split a district. I mean, we've got like 10 north, I think, or whatever, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| Carson's district has 10 voters. 10W has less than 100. It's basically a sorority village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| It's basically all it is. So, that can be adjusted by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Okay, thank you. Any other questions before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| I'm seeing none. We'll go on to the next item. As a body, we need to identify the goals that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2024)|
| 0:33:53| we would like to achieve during this process, i.e., making sure one district is a minority-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| district, using main thoroughfares as boundaries, things of such a nature. So, does anybody want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| speak first about what kind of goals they'd like to see this body achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2049)|
| 0:34:22| Mr. Schoomaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, basically, I've been saying since we first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| did the redistricting resolution back in January that, again, kind of on to your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| we need to make this a logical delineation for the general public so that if you use streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2076)|
| 0:34:45| corridors, I mean streets, avenues, whatever, that way the public understands, okay, if I'm west of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| Chapman Highway, then I'm in X district, you know, as opposed to where you split a neighborhood in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| half. Or, like, for instance, there's a school in my district where nobody that attends that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2100)|
| 0:35:11| can actually vote for me. So that was probably an anomaly 11 years ago where that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| look at those kind of things and then carve that out to the appropriate commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| But I think it just kind of, you know, keep it simple where everybody then can understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| hey, I'm in the 6th district, I'm in the 7th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| and whatever based on a specific geographic boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Does anybody else have any other comments they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| throw in here for what kind of goals you want to see achieved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2140)|
| 0:35:48| Seeing none, we'll move forward. Kind of brings us towards the end for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| our timeline and next date and goals and so forth. So right now what I'd like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2153)|
| 0:36:03| is have the next meeting on the 16th of September at 5 o'clock here. That's fine with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| I was going to invite all the school board members to come and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| and I was also going to ask the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican Party to come and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| This way everybody feels like they're giving their information. I'm going to try to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| send a press release out to all the media so they can invite all the people that want to come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| give their opinion, come speak. So that first meeting, the 16th, I want to be kind of a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| opinion meeting as a theme there and try to get everybody to give as much public opinion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| possible. And then the following meeting, which will be the 23rd, I want to concentrate more on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| since we'll have the maps and you guys will have about two weeks to really study the maps in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| districts, everybody give their opinion on their district and how they want to see it moved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| things about like that, and then we can move forward from there. Does anybody have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| objections on this? Commissioner Jay, I see your light on. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| note that the schedule was made some time ago and the first meeting was set for the 9th. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| has already been noticed and there is an agenda already made for the 9th. So if you're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| to have a meeting on the 9th and move right to the 16th, you need to work with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| office to cancel that. Sure. Any other questions? Is that the intention so I can take that as my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| calendar? Yep, that's the intention right now. Are there any other questions, opinions? Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| Seamaker? Yeah, I guess because this is based on voters, I mean population, not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2251)|
| 0:37:42| voters, the population and the district, I need some more clarification why that you'd want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2262)|
| 0:37:48| have political parties come and speak to us since this is a population issue, not a who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2268)|
| 0:37:57| what their political beliefs are. I just want to make sure we're not, we're being as open as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| possible, I guess was the theory behind that one. So we don't have to if we don't want to though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| I just thought as a courtesy, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| Okay, does anybody else have a comment on this? Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| That did strike me also. Okay. Mr. Seamaker and another thing I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| I wanted to give the school board people. Thinking out loud, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| I appreciate the effort and transparency. I mean of course this whole thing needs to be just as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| wide open as it can be. The thing that concerns me about the school districts is that just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| the situation that Mr. Seamaker mentioned having a school in his district and but nobody can vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| for him. I can already tell by looking at our maps, if we look too hard at all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2340)|
| 0:39:12| we are going to be in a, I'm afraid a mess in a big hurry. So my, I guess my concern about asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2352)|
| 0:39:21| school board members to speak is that they probably are going to say pretty much what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| Seamaker just said. I've got this school that is split. I've got the school that you know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| represent but nobody can vote for me or the other way around. All my kids go to one school and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| don't even represent it and I just, just because we are so time constrained, just throwing it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| there about how deep in the weeds I guess we might want to try to get or not get. Sure and the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| reason why I wanted to have, give the chance for all the school people to speak is when we change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| our district, it changes their district. So and there might be some insight that they would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| to give. Now they don't have to speak if they don't want to but I want to at least give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| the opportunity since what our decisions are will affect them directly. So we don't have to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| any political parties then we can but I would still like to invite any school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| that wants to speak to us. I know, I know. Commissioner Buehler. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2416)|
| 0:40:25| that is a tough one. Schools because you know the school board obviously is going to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| representative on the on the committee which will be Christy Christie. She's the newly elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| chairman, chairperson. Ideally nine districts should have I think 1.4 high schools in each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2433)|
| 0:40:42| something like that. That's not possible and as you move lines it could happen that you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| district with three, maybe a district with one but you know I would have to agree with Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| Hill. You're getting deep into some weeds when you start trying to to make it match perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| It's just not, it's an endless endeavor. I'm just asking this question because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| obviously I've never been part of redistricting before. I don't know that any of us have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| Randy, have you been around that long? I'm older than Tim but I've never been in my days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2474)|
| 0:41:22| Will the public have the opportunity to address this committee? Yeah, so I mean in regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2482)|
| 0:41:31| political party people, I think they'd have as much right to come as anybody if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| So Chris? There's one thing I just want to bring to the committee's attention. At some point in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| past and I will say that sometime in the last 10 years, whether that is the actions of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| commission or some other body, some group of individuals had the good foresight to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2508)|
| 0:41:56| that the school board districts and the county commission districts match up and from a not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| very selfishly, I'll tell you yes, it's much easier for me to administer an election the fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| ballot combinations I have and you have, just a sake of argument, if you have 11 county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| districts and nine school board districts, that's more combinations. It's more confusing for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| voters and ultimately one of the things that I know that Cliff Rogers saw and that I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| in the administration of elections now is it's very easy, for instance, if someone lives in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| district five to know that they also have school board district five so that they have John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| Schoonmaker and Susan Horne or they have Dr. Lundy and Yvette Satterfield. They know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| their districts are and so I don't necessarily know that that's the primary or even secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| goal of obviously what we're attempting to do here, but I do think from my perspective that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| a consideration that at least I'm going to try and advocate for is keeping those districts, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| they end up being, the same and that may be something that was a charter change or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| like that that needs to change or whatever. I don't get into the politics of it, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| but that's certainly something that I think if you're looking from a voter's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| that's something to consider. Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2585)|
| 0:43:14| Given the short time frame we have, I think we should get input from the public, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| we need to stick to crunching numbers as much as possible because we have a very short time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| and I think our main objective is to have equal districts. As Mr. Schoonmaker pointed out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2607)|
| 0:43:36| the law director pointed out, there are natural boundaries. Those are good guides, but the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| are going to actually direct what these districts look like. We can use those as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| but I think given the time frame, we need to concentrate on the maps, the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| and the distributions. Commissioner Busley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I was looking at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2635)|
| 0:44:03| of the numbers here, what Commissioner Smith was talking about, and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2643)|

| 0:44:16| it seems like we're going to have to shift a lot of things over and that's where it's going to cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| a lot of problems and where we have to do that when we're looking at our maps, it would be if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| we could get that sooner and we can go out and start talking to people and say this is what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| going to happen and explain why it has to happen. Sure. I believe we're going to get some maps at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| I believe we're going to get some maps at the end of the night here, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| help us all go home and do some homework and kind of see where everything adds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2679)|
| 0:44:47| Correct. Commissioner Hill. Just to reiterate our time crunch, if you could clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2687)|
| 0:44:59| the voting on this as far as, does it need to, can it be voted, can it be presented and read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| in the same month? Does it have to be heard one month and then the next month it's a two month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| We have to vote on it twice. All right, so we're talking about two months, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Excuse me, I was just going to say you could do a special call meeting and a regular meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| the same month, you know, if it takes us to the end of the hour, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| Okay. We'll try to get everything buttoned up in October and then vote on it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| All right, so thank you, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| The last meetings in November would be us voting on it, but we can, if we need more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| we can create more time. And that brings me to my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| I mean, Lord, I don't want to be meeting anymore than anybody else does, but I'm wondering about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| not having this meeting next week, given our push here. Is there, was there a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| a specific reason to have that two week gap? I was just going to give us a week to analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| everything. Also, it's a holiday week as well. So this way we can come in, we can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| everybody can look at it for a week or a week and a half, two weeks. And I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| lose everybody over the weekend and then come in here on a short week and nobody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| So I would try to give everybody enough time to actually dive into this. And so when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| do come back and meet, I guess let's all have an idea of what we'd like to see moved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| start talking next time we meet, what direction we want to go in and where we want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| and drop and all that kind of good stuff. Five o'clock on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2804)|
| 0:46:56| Commissioner Smith. Yeah, I think during this time before our next meeting to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| website and look at all the information and spend this time researching, you know, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| Commissioner Busler's point, you look at the numbers and you think it's pretty easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| shift some numbers, but the ripple effect is going to be, especially in the areas where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2832)|
| 0:47:20| our surplus numbers are and our negative numbers are, the stretch that's going to make is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| to be, could be confusing. But I think if we're not meeting the ninth or meeting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| 16th, what we could all do is study as much as we can and get as familiar with the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| as we can and the numbers and start to go ahead and get some ideas in our head that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| we can discuss about how these things can move. So I'm going to say for homework for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| everybody, come back to the next meeting and have an idea of what direction you want your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| particular precinct to shift in and how. Everybody can see how many they need to gain and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| many they need to lose to try to get to the right number. And that will start the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| off. We'll just go district by district and then I'll kind of start the conversation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| go from there. And then we can move forward from that. Does anybody have any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| or concerns, comments, anything else before we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Will you guys be providing us with some scenarios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| We are here to serve you. We can derive scenarios at your direction. We've done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2910)|
| 0:48:40| Alex Zendel and I, this is our fourth time around on redistricting for county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2920)|
| 0:48:50| We don't want to come up with scenarios on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| We're not, we're the technical support here. We need your input. We, as the operators of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| software, we've already done a test run when the data came out and we know that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| viable solutions. Don't feel like this is going to be a hopeless and lost cause because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| that it can be done. That said, we're not prepared to share that solution with you because that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| just a test drive for us, a demonstration. I can make recommendations or suggestions in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2960)|
| 0:49:32| maybe Chairman Ward, you want to talk to us or Vice Chair Smith, if you want to come in and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| with us just to kind of get a feel for what the software looks like, how it works, and how we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| done it in the past, we'd be happy to do that with you because the computer models work a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| more efficiently than trying to do this manually. I like the sounds of the idea of you all taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| these big maps and looking at your districts and seeing, you know, coming up with ideas on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| precincts that might move or might not move, but if we're happy to give you a tutorial on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3004)|

| 0:50:17| Is the software and the systems quick enough that during live meetings we can go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| scenarios and move and we can see them or is it something that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Not in this setting. The software doesn't work with the equipment we have here. It needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| it connects to databases that we have access to in our office, not to connections that we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| here in this meeting room. In years past, what we would do, and I'm just throwing this out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| just for historical reference, we would get guidance from the committee. They would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| move precinct one out of district three and into district two and let us know what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| or they'd say, you need to move that precinct five over into district nine because it lost a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| high school. You know, we would get that kind of guidance from the committee. We would take it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| and run it on our computer models and see what the results were. And typically what we would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| is we would come back to you with options. So we might take your direction and we can come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| with three viable solutions. None of them are going to be perfect and they all demand your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| attention and they all demand your input. That's how we've done it in the past and I can see us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| doing that again if that's the will of this committee. And you had mentioned you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| this I believe four times. Was that two county, two cities or was that four counties? This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| going to be our fourth time. We've done, we did the work in 2009 when the school board and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-redistricting?start=3103)|
