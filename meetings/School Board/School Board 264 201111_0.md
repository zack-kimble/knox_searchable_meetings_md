| 0:01:56| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=121)|

| 0:03:14| will be held in this Andrew Johnson boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| And as you know, we've been focusing on our vision and mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and I'd like to refer to Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| If you could give us your insight on our vision and mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you, Board Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| So our vision, to grow lifelong learners who contribute their talents, strengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Our mission, to provide excellent and accessible learning opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| that empower all students to realize their full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Reading over the vision and the mission statement, I found a few words that stuck out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Contribute, stronger, and full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| I also noticed that we have our listed in front of mission and vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| so it reads our mission and our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Not sure if that was intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| I don't remember us having an in-depth conversation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| But I think it's powerful because it expresses ownership and inclusivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| Last week, the public witnessed board members advocating for a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| outside of their own personal elected district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| These were comments that I received in emails, and they were very happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| We do it often, but it was greatly noticed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| That is a sense of ownership that leads to stronger communities across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| I challenge my fellow board members and myself to keep it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Continue to be informed and stay informed about the needs across our entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| With that mindset, that is how the board achieves our full potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| We have just one change, I think, to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| You should have received an email notice about a couple of items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| A couple agenda changes to include the addition of Item 12D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| a contract with the Tennessee Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| allowing them to reimburse Knox County Schools for participation in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=308)|
| 0:05:12| Mentor Matters Recruitment Initiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| For the previous two school years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| and also our discussion about quarantine protocols being moved to Item 13A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| or the first regular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Are there any other requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=328)|

| 0:05:50| I would like for us to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| This is a separate thing from what we're going to talk about the quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| I would like for us to look at what we're doing in regard to extracurricular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| groups and from a standpoint of fairness and uniformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=367)|
| 0:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| And I'll have some words to say about it when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=380)|

| 0:07:45| and I heard a lot about the exams and quizzes they took, education program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=465)|

| 0:09:14| CTE, of course, as we all know, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| an essential part of our education mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=556)|

| 0:21:54| because for my sanity, I felt like I had to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| And so I've continued to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| And I put out about, I guess it's been about 12 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| just Facebook, I just asked parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| I said, hey, have any of your kids been quarantined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| And I really didn't fathom what was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| But when I met with them this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| I had a count of 2,004 kids who were quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| that never got sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| And 179 teachers who were quarantined and never got sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| As of this afternoon, the student number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| is up to 2,176 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Out of that list, there are at least four of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| that have been quarantined more than one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| which in the short amount of time we've been in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| is a very long time for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| And I understand that there's fear, and I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| But our kids, you guys fought so hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| to have them in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| We need them in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| We need them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| They're fighting to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| They're doing everything that you tell them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| But so that little post that I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| was pretty eye-opening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| And if there were that many that shared with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| how many are there that aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| That just kept their kids home for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| they got behind in learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| they got behind in everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| And I know we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| So we want them to be in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| So again, thank you all so much for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| It's a terribly hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| And I appreciate all the time that you all spend on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| I really, really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| And I'm so grateful to my new friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| that I met this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So because I know that I'll probably see them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So thank you guys so much, appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| All right, so this was, I wanted to add this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| because I've continued to hear from parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And I am really very thankful for the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| and for our team here at Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| who have done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| And Angie, I'm glad you got to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| witness it because most people don't get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| And they are amazing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| So I'm thankful for the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| that Knox County Schools has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| with the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| And I think that most people are amazed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| that numbers have been really as low as they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| And that putting aside the quarantine issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| with just the number of cases that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| they've been low in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| And so I think that's been surprising to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| And it's because of so much hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| that's gone into that by our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| At our September two-day work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| I raised a concern and Dr. Buchanan was gracious enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| to come and speak to us at our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| And I raised the concern about so many healthy kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| being quarantined, and that's still my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| And at this point where we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| we have a lot more data than we did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| And from the evidence that I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| it's clear that students who are quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| because of the contact with a positive student at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| are not getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| And according to the information I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| listed in the medical arena,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| if you go into covenant facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| you see a little graph that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| what the levels of risks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So if you have a person with two people with a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| that's termed as an extremely low risk situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| So many, and so because of the low risk situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| that our students are in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I think that's part of why parents continue to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| about the thousands and thousands of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| that are at home each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| And then we don't see those healthy students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| actually becoming sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| And I understand the nature of quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| involves healthy people who may get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| But what I think is missing from that equation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| is that in this country, we don't wear masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| So if healthcare professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| have quarantined people in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| it hasn't been with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| that both parties were wearing a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| So if you have an extremely low risk situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| that seems to me that that should come into bear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| So the students that, who are quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1576)|
| 0:26:23| and then becoming sick, like I said, is extremely small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So I've, like Angie stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I've heard from parents who have had children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| who've quarantined at least three times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| like several who have quarantined three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| So if you think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| we've only been in school less than 10 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| So those kids have missed four to six weeks of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| That's a significant number of school days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| And so yes, the teachers are bending over backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| to make sure that those students are staying up to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| but it's extremely challenging and difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And so I'm very concerned about the academic losses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| that will be experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| because of missed time in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| I'm joined by a lot of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| who are concerned about the student academics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| and we know that learning suffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| when kids aren't in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| In addition, we continue to hear about the mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| of students as a huge concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| and students just living in fear of being quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| They're scared to death that they're going to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| And what will be the lasting effects of that kind of fear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| We won't know that for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| Five or six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| the Putnam County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| made a change to their reopening plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| that basically stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| that they would not be assisting the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| with identifying students to quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| So students who were sick at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| who were in contact with a positive case at school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| they chose to no longer assist in quarantining kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| So even though their community numbers have increased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| the student cases have stayed very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| I've talked to the board chair there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| If you look at their dashboard currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| they have 0.32% of their students who are positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| which for them is 28 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| and about 2% of their teachers and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| are in quarantine or isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| So, of course, they still have family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| who may be ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| so they would be quarantined for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| So you'll still have some quarantine kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| They would still have quarantine kids in that scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| They have continued to notify parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| if there is a positive case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| in the child's classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| so that parents can monitor their students closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| if they have been in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| to a student who tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And so I would really like to see our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| discuss what Putnam County has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| and look at whether what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| now that we have more data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| whether we need to continue in the path that we're on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| or whether we need to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| So that's why I wanted to bring this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| and I would love to hear your all's thoughts on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| Dr. Buchanan is here and I know we have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| and I expressed to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| that we continue to hear about contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| that maybe isn't what you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Maybe there's something out of the ordinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| and it's difficult to train all these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| to do something and then expect them to do it perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| So there are issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| so if you have questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| So I asked Dr. Buchanan to look and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| if she had data that she would like to share,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| and I'm not sure if she does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| but about what the health department may see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| of children who have been quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| with an exposure at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| and then whether they've gotten sick or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Dr. Buchanan, did you have anything you'd like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| I can speak to what you just spoke to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Thank you for allowing me some time to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I'm Dr. Martha Buchanan with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| and for those of you who might not know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| our data, school data is in with all the rest of our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| So to pull that school data out specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| is a very heavy lift for my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| who yesterday had the highest new cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| we've had since COVID started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| which is part of my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| We're not in a place where I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| we need to be changing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| The schools may be able to pull that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| I didn't ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| but to pull that data for my staff right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| is just not a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| But I think what I want you to hear from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| is that just because you don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| quarantine is for help well people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| That's the whole point of quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| You don't have the disease yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| We want to keep you from getting the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| but we want to keep other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| from getting the disease from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| just in case you do get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| We use it for lots of other things, not just COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| And it works and it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| So your cases in your schools are low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| in part because of quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| I firmly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| In part because Lisa Wagner and her team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| working with my team are very quickly identifying cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and isolating them and quarantining those at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| It's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| So we have low case counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| That's fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| My bigger concern is also about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I have to look at our entire community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| and risk that this poses to grandma and grandpa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| and mom and dad and baby sister| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| or whoever it is that's at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| The risk of not quarantining and not identifying those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| maybe it is a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| but those few children, students who do develop symptoms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| who do become cases of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| they haven't exposed any more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| because they've been in quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| So they haven't exposed their grandma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| They haven't exposed whoever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| They haven't exposed other students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| They haven't exposed teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| So that helps reduce your case counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| And so that it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| So in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| there've been more than 2000 cases of COVID in children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| between the ages of five and 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| In Knox County, the number's lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| It's been about more than 1000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| actually more than 1500 cases between zero and 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| if you look at our data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| And like I said, we had our highest number of new cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| and hospitalizations yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| And our numbers are going up at a rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| that is not what we wanna see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| And so our average cases per 100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| our 14 day average is 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| That's the highest we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| So that's quite high, 28 new cases per 100,000 population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| Knox County's population is 4,600,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| something a little more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| Flu season is upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We know what happens during flu season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| We end up closing schools mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| because of staff absenteeism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| not usually out of student absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And I would say the full body of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| to allow us to safely make this change, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| They're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| There's some evidence pointing in the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| that it might be reasonable to make such a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| but it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| So the full evidence isn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| I've looked, my staff has looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| There is some data to support this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| There's some data to support some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| I know UT is participating in a research study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| for college age students to look at quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| and their studies on school age children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and reducing quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| And when the evidence is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| we will happily make a change and support a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| At this time, I don't believe it's the right time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| And I don't believe the evidence supports a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Obviously you all look at the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and look at your data and consider what you wanna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| We will continue no matter what you decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| We will continue to work with Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| We have a great existing partnership with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| way before COVID around meningitis and flu| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| and Nora, when you name it and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| not just outbreaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| So that's really, we're following current CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| I will continue to recommend that we follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| the current Tennessee Department of Health and CDC guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2088)|
| 0:34:48| Okay, let's hear from some board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I don't know who was first, Ms. McBowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| And I appreciate you putting on this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| putting this on the agenda, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| And I appreciate the comments from those Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| and our guest, Angie as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| The numbers that I had been provided since Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| said that's a heavy lift right now for her department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| the numbers that I had been provided by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| and I'm not saying this is a totally scientific study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| but what I have is that there's been 5,267 kids quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2123)|
| 0:35:33| since the beginning of school, 5,267.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And out of those 5,267,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| we have produced 26 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| that tested positive after being quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2146)|
| 0:35:53| 26 versus 5,267 out of 90 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| We have 13 schools that show that there was a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| that was quarantined and then tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And I'm not sure even that's what they could pull for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| but that being said, there's no, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| evidence that that positive was a result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| of that contact in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| So while they were quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| having had exposure to someone in their class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| and then tested positive in very young days afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2191)|
| 0:36:39| during that period, I think that's a very low number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| It really concerns me and I would support this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| seriously looking at, I'm not opposed to contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| I think it's very important to let parents know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| that their child has been exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| and for them to be watching them very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| so as not to send them to school if they're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| But I think as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| our job is to educate the students of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| And while I appreciate our health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| looking out for the entire county as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| and the health of our students, given what Bob said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| given what we know, given what parents are telling us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| and in spite of our teachers doing the very best they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| I feel like our students are not receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| the education they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| And as you said, Ms. Horn, I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| been contacted by multiple parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| whose kids have had to quarantine multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And some have done well and some have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| And they're very concerned about their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| that are getting very behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| So just wanted to bring those numbers to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| and in consideration, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| I think, Ms. Owen, did you have your mic down early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I'm sorry, I was redoing the math with new numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| We all know I'm not a mathematician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| So looking just lightly at the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| we're talking about, somewhere between 2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| and 5,200 students, we're talking about between 3.5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| and about 9% of our students who've been quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2308)|
| 0:38:36| So those numbers, when we hear 5,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| that sounds really, really huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| That sounds like, I mean, that's far more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| than some of our counties even have students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| But for us, we're talking about around 8.9% of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| So looking at it that way may put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| in a little better perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| That those students haven't become sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| we don't necessarily know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| We may know that they haven't become symptomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| But whether they were actually positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| we don't know unless they were tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| And so without us knowing how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| of those students were tested, unless they were all tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| we can't accurately say that a very small number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| were positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| We don't have a way to know that unless they were tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| So we all know that students come to school sick quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2375)|
| 0:39:43| We all know that a lot of times it's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| oh, it's just the sniffles, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| And then we find out they're quite ill later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Looking at the spread and the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2395)|
| 0:40:01| and numbers in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| I think it would be really irresponsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| to take these numbers out of context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| and assume that these students were not positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| when we don't have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| What we're really missing is that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| on whether those quarantined people ever became positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Whether they became symptomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| is a completely different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| And whether they became symptomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| doesn't determine whether they were contagious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| It's whether they actually became positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| And that information we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Yes, we know that learning suffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| when students are not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| We know that, we have evidence for decades on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| However, to keep our students who may be positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| and no way to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| to keep them contacting more and more students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| and to allow that spread in the community to continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I think would be horribly irresponsible of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| We're looking at some anecdotal evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| for something that we have broad scientific evidence for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| We can't take small anecdotal evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| to make broad scientific decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| That just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| I think Ms. Fab was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| I'll just say at the forefront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| I probably agree with everybody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I am hearing from a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| actually today I heard from people on both sides of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| because they were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| we were talking about this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| But I've had lots of friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| I've had my own family members quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| I've seen the ill effects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| I don't like the number of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| that we are contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| However, being said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| I am not a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| I don't feel like, well, maybe Christine is a nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2522)|
| 0:42:05| but most of us are not on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| And I do really believe in listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| to the experts out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| which is our health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| who has been following guidelines of the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| With that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| I really, I'm getting forwarded articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| and there are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| you can find anything you want on the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| but then I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| there's some very credible studies out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| that I think Dr. Buchanan alluded to a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| that there are things going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| that I think are pointing to hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| maybe we can change some of our restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| I mean, I would love to see the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| if we can show proof of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| that with the masks in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| that maybe it's okay not to do the contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| If you're sitting at lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2567)|
| 0:42:47| with somebody with your mask off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Or, I mean, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| or maybe reducing the six feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| down to two feet or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| which would hugely affect the number of kids quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| So with that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| I really, I totally see what Ms. Horne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| and Ms. Bounds are talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| because I'm seeing it in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| I'm hearing from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| but I personally am going to side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| with following the guidelines set forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| One other thing I would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| is we just had people in our community decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| whether to go back to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| or not go back to school to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| And I've had several people contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| saying they based their decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| on protocols that were currently in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| That if we change our protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I do think we're going to have to open it up to parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| who do not feel safe any longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| sending their kids back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| So I do think that's going to be kind of a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| something if this board chooses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| to change the way we're doing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I do think we're going to have to look at the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| we just made people make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| because they made that under different guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| Okay, Mr. Watson, and then we'll come to Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| I think Mr. McMillan was asked the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Go ahead and let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Go ahead, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| So I'm certainly not a medical professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| but I deeply appreciate our medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| maybe more now during this season than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| You know, I was always that guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| that never went to the doctor intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| because it's like, I'm not feeling it, why do I need them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| So I appreciate to the degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| that the medical professionals in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| have moved to the forefront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| because I think we're understanding the pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| that they're on to a new degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And I want to speak just personally for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| My daughter has been quarantined twice now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| and my son is currently quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Once was contact trace through the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| and other through the youth development program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| but either way, I've adjusted everything in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| to sit down with my daughter for 14 days straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| to make sure that she doesn't suffer tremendous learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| And to be frank, she doesn't want me to say this, but she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| And it's been devastating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| and it has impacted every aspect of our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| And, you know, I have a good paying job and I'm married| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and I've got a spouse that's very supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| and I live in a good community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| And, you know, I don't have a lot of those struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| that some families in our communities experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| That being said, I don't think this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| is in the realm of education that we're having tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| I don't think this is a conversation that educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| or people who are vested in education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| are the ones that should be setting the tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| I think that's our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| And if my daughter's quarantined again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| I'm going to hate it and I'm going to drudge through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| And she's probably going to suffer more learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| but I can't imagine moving against the guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| of our public health officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| And Dr. Buchanan, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Is there anything that has shifted in our practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| around contact tracing since March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| specifically within schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| but in the community as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| like are we doing anything different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| in the way that we're doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| We actually haven't shifted very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I think if anything in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| we've gotten a little more surgical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| as we have gotten better at asking the right questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| and being more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| I have a team dedicated just to school contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| who works directly with Lisa Wagner and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| And they do everything they can to minimize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| the number of students that have to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| And the schools have gotten better too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| early on we had some instances where things happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| and they had like a bunch of kids in one room altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| that was way too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Those things haven't happened again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| So the schools have actually changed their practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| so that if there's a case in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| because what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| all these kids were in this tiny space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| and there was a person who was positive in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| So all of those kids had to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| It was crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Schools aren't doing that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Schools are learning as they go as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| and taking measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| taking steps to reduce the number of kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| that have to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| We haven't really changed anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| because the guidance hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I know the 15 minute cumulative thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| I know worried a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| We were kind of already looking at that at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| We were already considering the fact that they were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| all day and for several hours in the same classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| next to the same kids or children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| And so it has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| The number of students that we quarantine per student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| hasn't gone up since that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| So that's important for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| We were kind of already looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| because we used the seating chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| and talked to the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| and understand where the kids are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| and who was there and who wasn't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| and who's absent and who's not and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| So I'm not surprised that the methodology has not changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| because you all have been doing contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| way before COVID, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| But our quality and our effectiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| and our fidelity at doing it within this context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| has improved, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| We've become more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| I would say yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| Than doing that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Okay, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| And also I think it's a valid point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| and I want you to, if I'm hearing you correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I want you to kind of say it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| One of the reasons why we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| some of the things that we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| from a count perspective in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| is because we are doing these things, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| So I think it's an interesting comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| I've heard this a bunch in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| and I've heard a lot of parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| I mean, we all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| We've got a lot of parents that have emailed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| and contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| And as I just described my own situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| I honestly feel for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| I totally get it in every regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| But the argument that I sometimes hear is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| hey, but look, it's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| And I'm like, well, yeah, because we're doing stuff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Like if we back away from the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| that make it not that bad, then it's gonna get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| Is that true from a public health standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Certainly our concern that backing away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| from what we're doing will increase the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| of the number of students and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| that are ill in the schools that have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And we feel for the parents and students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| I have staff members, team members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| whose kids have been quarantined more than once also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| And they've had to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| And it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| And it's hard when you have to miss your softball tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| or your basketball tournament or your chess tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| or whatever it is you're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| because you're quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| But it's where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| as a community, as a nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| we are in this place where things need to be different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| for us to be able to move forward successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| And Ms. Owen made a statement, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Would you mind validating it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| She made the statement that there's a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| between numbers of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| that have proven to be symptomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| who have been contact traced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| versus ones who have been positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| And we really don't know how many kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| may have been positive who have been contact traced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| And for a couple of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| one is not all of them get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| And we're not able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| because of the volume, 200 plus cases yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| and 100 plus cases every day for the past several days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| we're not able due to volume to really do that detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| When we have a little outbreak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| you know, like in one school or a couple of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| we can get a lot of detail and learn a lot more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| But we don't have that really good follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| unfortunately, partly due to volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3042)|
| 0:50:42| And I've also know that for some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| there's a reluctance to either get tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| or say, man, I'm not feeling well or whatever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Because we've been through this long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| that people understand the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| of saying those things or doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| And so I think that also adds to the discussion is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| and I'm not faulting those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| I mean, there's real world consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| to raising your hand and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| yep, that's me or I'm gonna go get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| But I do think it adds to the validity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| that I don't know that we really have accurate data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| And what I'm hearing from you is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| from when we heard from you a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| in that the data's coming in, we're analyzing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| we're gonna make decisions when we feel like we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| But Dr. Buchanan, in fairness to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| you're not sitting there just thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| man, I'm gonna make this as hard as I can, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| I mean, are you doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| You don't look like you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| I mean, we've never had coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| but you just don't seem like you're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Okay, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| I just have a couple of questions that I wanna ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| But first, in reference to what you were describing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| about your situation with your children there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Mr. Watson, I think you, somewhere along the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| you said something about it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| you didn't realize it, but it was devastating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| Oh, I realized it the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| It's been devastating, no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Well, it's the socialization, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| that is the main difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| We talked briefly about this earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| about the difference between learning at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| as opposed to going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| And I think that's one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| that we have had this tremendous response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| once they saw how it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Now, it might get much worse with flu season coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| And nobody can predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| That is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| But nevertheless, I've heard several experts talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| or so-called experts, talk about on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| about that kids were resilient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| the younger they were, the more resilient they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| And in many cases, some could have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| and recover from it quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| and never know that they had anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| because they're young and energetic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Would you disagree with that, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| No, sir, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| We don't see a severity of disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| like we do in adults and children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| although we certainly see severe disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| There have been at least 11 hospitalizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| in Knox County for children with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| That's not a high number, but if you're a parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| this kid ends up in the ICU at Children's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| that's a high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| Well, let me ask you this while you're up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Don't go off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| If these kids are quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| I know you have tracing and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| but what assurance do you have that they go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| and they stay home for 14 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Well, actually, they're contacted at least every other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| if not every day, by our contact monitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| that's the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| So we have folks who are monitoring contacts of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| and asking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| We have to trust the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| because obviously we're not asking the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| we're asking the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| You do it during normal business hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| We have staff who are kind of staggering time right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| and we're doing it seven days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| But we have to take the word of the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| And that's just like a lot of other things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| When we have a tuberculosis case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| we have to take the word of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| that are in quarantine, waiting their TB results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| that they're staying home and doing what we ask them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| It's like a lot of public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| We rely on the public to do the things we ask them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| and have to trust that they're doing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| We do have some authorities to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| if we know for sure they're leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| or they're doing things we've not asked them to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| we have some authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| We don't exercise those willy-nilly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| because we realize that that's really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| in the best interest of our community to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| So bottom line is, the answer would be no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| that you do not have any way of monitoring them 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| particularly if the parents were willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| to say that they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| You know, they could leave seven o'clock at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| not come back till midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| They sure could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| And I would guess some of them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Now, not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| There are some strict parents out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Now, I'm not getting on the parents or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| The point I'm trying to make is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| there's no, what you all are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| I'm not condemning it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| but I'm just saying it's not a foolproof system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| Let me ask you one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| To the best of your knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| with kids under 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| have we had any deaths in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| I actually can say for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| we've had no deaths in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| of children under 18 from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Have we had any extended serious illnesses from COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3414)|
| 0:57:02| that lasted longer than a normal span?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| To your knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Yes, sir, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| I don't know that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Is it 10 or 10?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| There've been 11 children hospitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| and it's less than 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| but some of those children have developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| this severe inflammatory disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| that can happen in children after they have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be hateful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| but that's what I wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| was some kind of solid number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I just have a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| and a couple of questions for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| And the first is, I agree with Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| I mean, parents made their decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| based on our current protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| You know, for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| I mean, some parents were afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| that their child might be quarantined multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and just decided to opt for virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| So, you know, I don't think that we could even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| I wouldn't even wanna entertain changing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| if we didn't open that window back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| And my other concern is for our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| And, you know, last semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| they had the option of taking a leave of absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| And I, is it correct, Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| they're not, they don't have that option this semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| That's correct, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| So to loosen up the restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| but then not give them that same option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| to, you know, take that leave of absence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I don't think that's fair to them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| I think that would be something we would have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| I know that one of the emails we received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| suggested that teachers could wear N95 masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| And I am curious, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| is there, you don't hear much about PPE these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| An N95 mask is really only indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| when you're doing a medical procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| that causes aerosolization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| So you have to be fitted for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| you have to wear it properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| It's much more uncomfortable than a procedure mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| or a cloth mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| They're really not designed to be worn long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| They're designed to be worn for the time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| you're doing that procedure and not worn all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| So that would not be a good solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| for our teachers to wear those all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| And I guess my other question for you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| and it kind of goes along with what Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| and Ms. Owen pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| we really don't know how many of these children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| tested positive for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| I mean, we know how many tested positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| but we don't know how many actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| Right, the contacts that tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Right, because, I mean, I know you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| at the retreat there was some resistance in getting tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| especially parents with younger children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| who might not get as sick with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| because they do have that fear of quarantining for 24 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| So they need to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| And we've continued to see that resistance among athletes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| especially in high school for testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| So we've continued to be told by athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| who do end up getting sick and getting tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| that they didn't want to get tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| and that they've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| their parents would rather they not get tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| You want your kid to stay in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| And if it's his senior, his or her senior year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| you want them to play that sport they've been playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| for however long they've been playing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| and have the successes and wins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| and have that good time with their team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| So I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| So it's an interesting time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| It's very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| I can't wait to see all the stuff published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| about all the psychology of all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| And I guess my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| and I have no doubt that this affects learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| I mean, I know that we want our kids in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| and I want our kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| But when you talk about those numbers of failing students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| are we, do we really know that exact number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| Because I know there's some different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| the teachers took grades in their grade books where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| and I don't know if Dr. Roslick, you could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Cause I know we've had a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| I mean, I know sometimes the marking is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| where it doesn't reflect the zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| So our data might show that they're passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| but I don't believe all teachers use that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| No, I think you're, I'll say this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| I'll say first, I mean, the numbers are the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| but there are lots of stories behind some of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| on the failing, which I kind of made a list of some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| as we've looked into those that may help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| So, you know, we have a lot of different factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| in the virtual part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| And what you're referring to is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| especially in the high schools, lots of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| it's kind of the full semester that takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| So if students have missed assignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| there's lots of times that a teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| will put a zero in for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| knowing that the student can go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3729)|
| 1:02:10| and make that up at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| but teachers don't want to like give a pass for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| and have a student with a B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| And then at the end of the semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| load all the zeros in, and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| the kid's failing all of a sudden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| they'd rather show the student where they're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| at that time in the ninth week or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| So then the student, you know, has a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| to make that up and feels urgency to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| So that is true, especially in the high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| you'll see some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| I think there's some other factors too in our virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| especially in our elementary virtual quest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| 25% of those teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| this is their first teaching job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| So, you know, typically your year three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| is where you start seeing, you know, some of that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Now they're doing great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| They're, you know, we have some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| rock stars that are doing some great things there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| but, you know, we've been doing in-person for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| And I think in two to three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| we'll probably be able to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| we feel like that, you know, that it's at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Some other things that are there too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| I mean, we know, and I know what the board retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| we talked about, and again, we'll make sure we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| this is not every student who's in virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| but stereotypically the folks who chose virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| when we looked at past performances on state tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| were more of them were in the bottom 50 percentile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| on those tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| Most of the in-person students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| the higher peak of that was in the upper 50 percentile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| So, you know, again, some of that is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| We do know there was learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| as Mr. Watson has said, from March and not having school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| So we've talked about our virtual failures being higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3808)|
| 1:03:31| in-person numbers are higher too on the failure rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| And we knew that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| I think everyone in the country knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| that was probably gonna happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| So again, the numbers that Mr. Thomas has shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| are correct numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| but there are some stories behind those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| And our REA team is tracking that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| to have some more insight into that by the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| to see where those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| So I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| Ms. Pat, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| Dr. Rizek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Yes, I just want some clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| regarding what Putnam County did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| regarding are we looking to just not communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| with the health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Are you looking to have our own quarantine system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| Like what are, what's the result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Okay, what the five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| I think they listed five items that what they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| they deferred to the health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| to the department of health for the quarantine process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| They continued to inform all students, staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| families of close contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| with COVID positive students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| They, it says this change will be continually evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| and is subject to change with increase in spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| We will, they will continue mitigation strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| such as the use of masks and social distancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| when feasible and that the isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| for COVID positive students will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| So those were five statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| that they had in their resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| Essentially, they were not passing on the names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3899)|
| 1:05:04| of students, of student contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| if there was a positive case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| That's essentially what their change was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| So they were wearing masks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| kind of the same as us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Which without passing on the names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| then they wouldn't be able to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| who all needs to be quarantined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| They would, if there was a student in a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| they were, they are notifying parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| that a student in, a student in your child's class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| tested positive, please be aware of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| and monitor your child more closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| kind of message, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| So it wouldn't, so the parents would get that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| and, but the school was not providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| basically a seating chart, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| as the way our nurses are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| with the health department to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| who would need to quarantine from school contacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| They're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| And I guess my next question is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| if it does move forward and we do support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| what you're suggesting, what does that look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| for, do we open it back up for parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| who might wanna make a shift to changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| what they required, what we required them to do last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| or just your insight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I mean, I wasn't, I see, I definitely see the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| you know, that Ms. Fab and Ms. Christy made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| because that's, that is in our reopening plan as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| You know, I don't, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| that we would necessarily open it back up though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| You know, so when, I think when I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| it's, you know, a lot of, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| the number I have would be 13% of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| with the 52, 67 with like roughly 40,000 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| it's probably 13% of students have been quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| and only 0.5% that we think are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| have gotten COVID from an exposure at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| And of course there's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| everybody knows it's hard to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| you know, where they actually got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And it's, so there's definitely a piece of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| that's anecdotal, but I think we still do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| you know, some numbers that we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| that we have at this point that we can take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| Okay, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| One is, I think it's important for us to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| that we're not talking about a closed system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| When we talk about Knox County schools, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| our system interacts with a lot of other systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| including the family system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| And I think it's also important to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| that if we do something and we shift drastically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| in the way that we're contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and we don't let a family know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4072)|
| 1:08:00| specific, the reality is, although yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| we all, I think are clear from the scientific data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| that kids are impacted way less by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| than any other demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| Kids aren't living by themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| like they live with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| And some kids live with like their grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| or some kids live with people who are asthmatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| or who have other underlying conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| And again, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| I think it's important for us to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| the weight of any decision we make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| related to Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| that it does impact our whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| We would like to think that it doesn't, but it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| It will have some type of impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| on the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Dr. Reisman, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| And it's to me, it's the other side of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| And I have no doubt that you guys are working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| but I would love for you to speak just a little bit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| We have been quarantining and we know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| we've been contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| And I know we've been looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| and learning from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| How are we elevating best practices for our educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| who are figuring out how to walk really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| with those students who are experiencing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| How are we, because to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| it's either you shift the way you're doing contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| and quarantining, or you become more effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| at supporting those who have experienced that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| And I have no doubt that Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| is doing that and wanting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| But can you speak to a little bit to how you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| as a team, are trying to become more effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| at walking with those kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| So, a lot of this, we spoke to that kind of this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| about saying, in a typical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| had this been a strategic plan to move to like one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| and to have these kinds of options for families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| it probably would have been a multi-year rollout, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| And so the good thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Teresa Nixon and her department at Techside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| have been doing this work for about eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| So we have some one-to-one schools in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| So we do have a lot of those best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| that we kind of already have on the shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| as well as a lot of lessons we've learned from those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4204)|
| 1:10:14| So I think for us to hurry and expedite all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| through the course of the summer and the trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| again, Shannon and her team did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| of laying a lot of that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| a lot of our principles and choosing who to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| And just now we're getting some of the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| on some of those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Like one of those I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| 25% of our Quest elementary teachers were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| this was their first job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| Well, at the in-school level of virtual, it was only 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| So there, the principal made choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| based on who had shown kind of a track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| of being the best teachers with technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| So I think we're learning now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| kind of as we track a lot of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| but we are sharing those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| I mean, there's still professional development that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Again, Teresa Nixon has about five different avenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| of how she gets input from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| All teachers have the option to be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| They have collaborative sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| A lot of it, again, we can't do in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| So a lot of that's through Microsoft Teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| or a lot of that's through different groups that share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| We have a group that has been meeting, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| for multiple years of principals and instructional coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| and teachers who have been sharing those ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4278)|
| 1:11:18| So where we see best practices, we share those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I think I might've told the story before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| that we started the year Microsoft Teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| teachers doing whole groups in elementary level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| and then how do they do breakout groups and small groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Well, initially we were logging kids off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| and then having certain ones stay on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| and we're realizing other kids weren't logging on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| So they figured out how to create smaller rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| to be able to toggle back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| the whole group to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| So I mean, it's those kinds of things that are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Schools are using lots of different apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| We know like Class Dojo has been a big piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| Seesaw has been a big piece, like some different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| And so as we go out and talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| ones that are working at those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| we're trying to support, scale those up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| and share those with other schools as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| So I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| And one of the things that I'm hearing though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| is I feel like you're specifically talking mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| to the virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| So what is it that we're uniquely learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| about kids who are moving to quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| and suffered a disruption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Because it's a little bit different than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| hey, I'm in my groove, I'm doing virtual learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| And to me, the deficits that I'm seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| and there's not a whole lot, but what I am seeing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| it's really on the communication side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| because of the disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| It's like the kid tomorrow pivots real fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| parents aren't ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Oh my gosh, who do I talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| One of the things I saw just real practically is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| if you look in Canvas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| my daughter looks like she has 20 things missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| If you look in Aspen, it's three things missing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| So it's because it's where information's kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| how it's communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| So is there any specific conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| about how we're supporting kids virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| who have experienced the disruption of quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| not people who are just in the groove?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Yeah, and I'll say, I mean, I have two daughters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| I'm both on their second quarantine right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| So I've experienced that as a parent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| You know, it is good, and yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| so the quarantine was probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| of all the things we planned for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| the one that was the toughest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| So we, you remember our conversations early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| where teachers would be virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| or they would be kind of in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| And from the beginning, our expectation was everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| either way, was practicing our major tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| of Microsoft Teams and Canvas and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| So none of those expectations changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Taking computers home, preparing for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| especially moving to inclement weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| those kinds of things, you know, looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| But I think that the quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| was the one that was kind of the in-between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| You know, we didn't know, starting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| was it gonna be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| two or three kids in a grade level at a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| and so it wasn't a huge deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| and the principals would be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| to work that out with the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| So we kind of gave the schools a lot of autonomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| because we didn't, it's not that we didn't have a game plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| we'd never experienced it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| So what we've seen is a lot of the high school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| can be kind of independent learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| I've seen it, and it's kind of both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I've sat in a teacher's classroom this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| that was doing both, where they had about seven students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| who were quarantined and some who had chosen virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| who had just incorporated that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| and, you know, I asked that teacher, what was that like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Like, we weren't asking that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| but the principal and the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| had made that decision that worked for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| And it was going great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| She said, the first three weeks were harder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| than I ever thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| and I wouldn't do it any other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| So, you know, I think it's based on just who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| what's there, this particular school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| offers certain courses where they didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| multiple teachers to go virtual and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Other places we see it is kind of what you described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| where they're able to put, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| the assignments in Canvas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| and then they kind of have a contact time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| on email and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| But, you know, you're kind of governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| you're kind of working through that on your own as a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| It's hard for us, we can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| our teachers are going above and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| but we can't, like, contractually ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| to have seven o'clock, you know, hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| or that sort of thing, because they're having their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| so it has been a little tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| And with that, we don't have extra teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| to kind of say, when you go quarantine, you go here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| because then you've got, you know, 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| but that may be, you know, seven classroom days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| and it's not worth pulling you off that teacher's roster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| and pulling them back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4506)|
| 1:15:06| And most teachers are saying, just let me keep the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| you know, let me keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| and try to support them as best I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| instead of sending them somewhere for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| five to seven days and then bringing it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| So, honestly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| that's probably still in development stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| and we're seeing it different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| and not treated the same way everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Probably what's working best is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| what we know all along is the teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| who has the relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| who can continue to work with the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| But we are also aware that we can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| ask them to teach on both platforms all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| every day, and plan for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| So, it's kind of a catch-22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| where we're at with that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Okay, any other comments, Ms. Spatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| Yeah, I just wanna just put this comment out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Like, I actually overheard a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| with some parents speaking and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| that they opted to just switch to virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| because their kid had been quarantined so many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| and they were, the kid was failing the courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| because they weren't prepared for virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| So, I do see that part, and I do hear that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And I believe that if we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| my biggest hangup is that if we make this switch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| and this change, our schools are in somewhat of a groove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| of doing school during a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| And if we make this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| I'm fearful that this might be the straw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| that breaks the camel's back for some of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| I'm getting a lot of reports from my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| specifically from principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| just saying that it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| we're pretty much at our wits' end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| when it comes to staffing people and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| And I do believe the quarantine process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| goes into that reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| But it's already enough of a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| that we're enduring, that they're enduring right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| to where another shift right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| I personally feel it might just be too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| And so, maybe this would be something we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| about switching going into the spring semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| And I don't know if that was the plan originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| but I think making that switch right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| would be really, really rough on our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| Not saying that I, I do support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| that we shouldn't be quarantined, it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| But I just think the timing of the shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| might just be too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| I don't wanna put our student rep on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| but I think it's important that we hear from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| about how students feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| And I'll give her a second to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| while I ask for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| I'd like to request some information for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| And I know we won't have this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| but sometime in the next week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| If we could have the total number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| who have been quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| as well as the total number of instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| so that we can tell whether that 5200 number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| is the number of individual instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| or if it is individual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| And if we could also see the numbers of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| who have been quarantined multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| If that's difficult to break out, that's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| I think it's more important that we be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| whether we are looking at numbers of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| or numbers of instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| Mr. Myers, I'm assuming you don't have that handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Okay, thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Ms. Abbey, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| Sure, so I'm a virtual learner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| so I haven't been quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| I mean, technically I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| but I would say just from what I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| it's really hard as a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| when you're consciously trying to do everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| You're wearing your mask and your social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| and then to be called into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| and told that you have to stay home for the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| which is something you weren't prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| I have a friend who was just sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| in his assigned seat in class and got quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| because the person behind him had tested positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| And I think that as a student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| you just want some explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| as to why you're being quarantined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| when it was just the person behind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| and you've been all wearing your mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| So I definitely support quarantining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| but maybe a change to how it's being done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| so that students are understanding why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| and maybe getting better guidance during quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| because I know it was hard for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| to be a virtual learner for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| and then to just switch to that for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| would be really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4774)|
| 1:19:35| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| I just had a question for Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| Dr. Buchanan, I thank you so much for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| and I'm just trying to really understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| but we've done so much in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| I feel like, and Knox County in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| in trying to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| wearing our masks, social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So given that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| the students are wearing their masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| that they're social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| the teachers have worked really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| to put that distance between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| We've had very creative ways of doing recess time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| to separate the students as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| while we still give them some fresh air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| which we now understand really helps and vitamin D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| We've got custodians going above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| with all of these things that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| how can we say that quarantining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| and you can help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| because I'm not a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| It's just, there's so many variables here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| that I don't know how we can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| that quarantining is making a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| in our own numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Because we've also got the masking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| we've got the distancing, we've got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| But what we also know from years and years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| and years and years and years of public health experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| is quarantine works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| It's quarantine plus all of these other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| that are helping to keep numbers low in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| There's tons of evidence that quarantine works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| not just with COVID, but with several other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| If you don't get exposed to a disease, you can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| So that quarantine works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| And so, the challenge is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| and this is not limited to Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| If you are in a work scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| and you are closer than six feet from your coworker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| and you both are wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| you're still gonna be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| So we're not treating the schools any differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| than we treat the rest of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| And trust me, the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| is struggling with this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| And yes, masks work, they reduce risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| they don't eliminate risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And that's the reason the CDC has continued to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| even if both people are wearing masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| if one of them becomes a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| the other person has to quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| because it doesn't totally eliminate the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| it just reduces it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And if we get the data to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| a change in quarantine for students or workplaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| or whatever, we'll be happy to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| We just don't have that data yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Is there, and I know that this is a totally new experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| but is there a time in the history that you can remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| that we've quarantined healthy people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| We always, sorry, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Or has it always been in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| that we've quarantined the sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| You only quarantine healthy people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| You isolate sick people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| So isolation is when you have the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| and you have to stay home until you're no longer infectious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| Quarantine is you've been exposed to disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| you need to stay out of circulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| for the incubation period of the disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| to see if you get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| so that you don't make other people sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Well, I appreciate your comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| I would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| I've listened to the board very attentively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| and I think we've had some great discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| And I do hear what you're saying, Ms. Babb and Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| It may be too late as we're looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| because of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| because our window has already been closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| and we don't want to catch parents off guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| So even if the board decides to make no change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5006)|
| 1:23:32| based on the comments that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| or on the portal window being closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| I still want the board to continue to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| I'm not opposed to quarantining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| I just think we need to quarantine less students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| And I don't know how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| I just don't think we wholesale quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| And I think we have to have very good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| And I really appreciate the comments of our student rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| because you made a whole lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| And I think we have to have a good basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| for why certain students are being quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| I don't think we can just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I mean, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| and I will look forward to Jennifer's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| but I still feel like even if it's 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| 5,200 kids, if that's the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| and some of those may be duplicates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| I'm sure they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| but that is still a significant number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| given right now what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| the kids that have tested positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| having been quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| So I just would like to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I don't know, work with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| to see that we can get those quarantine numbers down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| I'm not opposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| you know, I want the parents to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| I want us to do our best job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| but I do think the quarantine numbers are extremely high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| And we need to develop a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| that would limit that to where we're not quarantining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| as many kids or multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| Ms. Christie and then Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| I guess for Superintendent Thomas and Mr. Diepler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| is it possible to open the window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| the portal back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| or to give teachers that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| of taking another leave of absence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| And I guess if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| my question would be to Mr. Diepler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| are there any legal concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| with us changing the way we do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| after we have closed that window?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5132)|
| 1:25:39| Thank you, Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| And I may call on Mr. Trent or Dr. Roswick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| to help me with the scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| The whole point of getting this out early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| was to give our principals more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| and our teachers, our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| to develop the schedules and the courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| for the spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| So I'll let one of them comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| I'm thinking that it's gonna be pretty difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| at this point to open it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| and still be able to get the schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| but certainly we'll do whatever the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| is asking us to do in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| So as far as the leaves are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| we can open that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| The issue would become, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| finding teachers to take the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| of the teachers that would take the leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| if there would be a significant number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| I think we had 52, three, four teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| who took the leave of absence without pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| We had, I believe, six or seven of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| that submitted, I think, a resignation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| rather than come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| And then we've had some who have taken medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| their conditions allowed them to be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| to take a medical leave for spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| And then we have some coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| So obviously, the concern would be filling the positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| But Dr. Weiser, if you wanna comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| on the scheduling piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| I'll be quick, but I'll say, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| kudos to Danny and Julie for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| They've been very proactive with their principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| I know Danny's had a full day with high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| socially distanced, eight at a time in a huge room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| But doing that yesterday, both Stanley and the IT team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| has been very much as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| But what Mr. Thomas said is exactly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| I think our net's about 5,100 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| roughly, moving back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| Still have about 13,000 virtual kids, so still a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| But now comes the time of figuring out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| that second semester master schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| and what do you collapse and what do you not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| And Mr. Thomas, again, has been great to challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| to make sure that, as hard as everyone's worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| that they take some time over the winter holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| to not be in working on schedules every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| So we really, we feel like it'll be tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| But I think we can probably get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| And I'll let Danny come up and add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5269)|
| 1:27:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| We met with high school principals yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| and middle school principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| And we talked about scheduling, both Stanley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and the IT department shared the information and the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| And it's gonna be a huge task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| You know, this summer, you all were gracious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| and we extended that timeframe for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| And I'll tell you right now, that saved us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| We could have never got schedules ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| in that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Because, you know, we usually build schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| we start in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| And it takes us through May to June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| to get the schedules finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| So, you know, we asked schools to do schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| in the span of about three weeks and they pulled it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| Right now, I think the problem we're facing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| it's what, November the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| You know, we've got about five weeks until the break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| six weeks, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| Our counselors who actually do a lot of the scheduling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| we also have testing coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| You know, all the things that go into the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| And Janice is here and she could tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| how much our counselors are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| with social and emotional stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| We've got kids hurting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| We've got kids hurting at home on virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| and we've got kids hurting in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| So I can speak to this, cause my daughter's a counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| And she gets to school and from 7.30 to 4.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| she's either talking to a kid or talking to a parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| So, you know, in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| then, you know, her principal says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| well, let's build a master schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| And not just her, but a lot of these counselors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| are taking this home and they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| on schedules all night long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| The numbers did not look too bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| for the majority of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| But if you've got over a hundred changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| that's a huge task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| And some of you, each one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| you've got kids in school, you've had kids in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| you know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| It could mean that we are changing teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| And, you know, the blood pressure starts going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| You know, if you get that call and I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I say your teacher's gonna change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| you know, you're upset, mama's upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| daddy's upset, everybody's upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| So we're trying to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| I really think, and I get what Ms. Christie's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| that we need to stick to what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| but at the same time, we've got to do what's right for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| And I think if Ms. Christie called me with her kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and there's something just extreme going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| then we always take into special consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| and try to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| But I do think the majority of principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| want to stay the course with what we've set forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| And just between what we have to do between now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| and December 18th is gonna be a huge monumental task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| and they will get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| And the superintendent has been gracious enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| If we have to have some people work over Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| we're gonna compensate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| But I can tell you right now, we'll have to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| According to what Mr. Trent said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| one of my questions was gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| how many days do we have left first semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Apparently, it's something in the high 20s or around 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| Does that sound reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| The number of school days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| The number of school days that are left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| It would be somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| Okay, it doesn't really matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| whether it's 26 or 30 from this perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| Would there be any interest among the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| in reducing the number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| the remainder of the semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| and seeing how it worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| just for the remainder of the semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Reducing-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| On the quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| The number of days of quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| So reduce it from like a 14-day quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| down to a lower number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Yeah, would there be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I'm just asking open-endedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| is there any interest among the board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| I know there's not with a couple of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| but there may be with some others, may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| If not, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Well, Dr. Buchanan-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Go ahead, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5536)|
| 1:32:16| Dr. Buchanan, you stated that the quarantine's purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| was to make sure that those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| did not develop symptoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| So can we shorten it to 10 days versus 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| to make sure that those people have not developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| How long does it take for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| to develop a symptom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5555)|
| 1:32:36| 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| The incubation period for COVID-19 is 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| So quarantine is always for the length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| of the incubation of the disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| And yes, many people develop symptoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| or test positive sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| However, there still are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| who do not develop symptoms or test positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| until the end of that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| So the incubation period for COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| as we know it now, is 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| So shortening that, there's no scientific data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And you run the risk of the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| of not quarantining at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| that you'll have kids coming back, as we know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| children come to school when they're sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| just like during flu season and other times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| So there's no scientific data to support doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Ms. Bounds, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Go ahead, Mr. McNaughton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| I was just gonna make the comment that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5613)|
| 1:33:42| with all due respect to Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| she is a health professional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| but contrary to what some people believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| she does not have authority over the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| We have, we and the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| have control over it and say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| And, you know, if we reduced it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| we certainly have that within our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Do we not, Mr. Duplin, to reduce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Mr. Duplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5665)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And I can address Ms. Christie's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| I mean, if you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| but so the board is granted its power through the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5670)|
| 1:34:36| and through the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| So the board does have exclusive control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| over the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Naturally, the board works with the state health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| and the Knox County health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| with the guidelines and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5689)|
| 1:34:51| But Mr. McMillan, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| I mean, the board does have the power collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| Nobody said anything about that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| we wouldn't continue to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| But I think there's some people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| as well as on the board are tired of them being dictatorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5712)|
| 1:35:21| And just whatever they say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| they act like it's just the gospel truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| And they know more, they do know more about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5736)|
| 1:35:41| But we've, as we were talking a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| there are a lot of kids that are resilient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| And, you know, if I had a kid in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| I would much prefer him have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| if he got, he or she got quarantined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| to have it at a reduced number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| I've even heard some places where they were going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| they were tested and letting them go back after nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| But, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| I have, I remember what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Dr. Buchanan, and I'm sure some of the other board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| have as well, I continue to get calls from parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| about their kids being quarantined beyond the 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Because, can you help explain that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| Because from the time of the contact tracing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| and time they contact trace and contact the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| the last parent I heard from, it had been eight days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| since the kids contact at 3.30 in the afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| with that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| But they were all, so it extended that quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| well past the 14 day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Without specifics, I really don't want to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Do you want me to start forwarding those emails to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| But, you know, it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| I've heard more than once that, and I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| I mean, I can't speak to it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I just have received more than one email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| from multiple people about their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| being longer than the 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| There's a lot of nuance to quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| and that I can't speak to without knowing specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| Theoretically, if a student is exposed on a Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| and they're notified on a Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| It starts on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| When they were exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5856)|
| 1:37:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| Can I make a comment in reference to what Ms. Brown said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| I don't want to belabor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| but I mentioned it at the retreat about the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| And I still believe that she told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| that they would quarantine everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| and then they would turn the ones loose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| that didn't need to be quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| What did you tell me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| If I did, I said that in error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| So, I don't do isolation and quarantine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| but here's the basis for isolation and quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| If Ms. Christie tests positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| anybody who's sitting within six feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| or standing within six feet of her for 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| or less than six feet of her for 15 minutes or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| cumulative over a 24-hour period, would be in quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| So, that would include potentially you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| I don't know how far away you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| But none of the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| because we're not up here that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| Well, since you don't want to talk about specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| I'll be a little more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| This was a gym class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| where I would think it would be pretty open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| And the father that I talked to of the young lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| who was sent home for 14 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5943)|
| 1:39:12| they saw, and she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| I have never been in my life within 30 feet of that kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5956)|
| 1:39:23| But did I give her an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| But they chose to allow three or four athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5966)|
| 1:39:33| that they were needed on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| So, they didn't, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| And I don't expect you to know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| But it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| And what Ms. Bounds is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| that it can stand out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| Mistakes get made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5989)|
| 1:39:49| Well, it's not just mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| It's intentional things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And it's costing kids way too much time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| just like what Ms. Bounds said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| So, you know, that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6006)|
| 1:40:06| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| We really need to wrap this conversation up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| I see a couple of people still have mics down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| Can you make a very, very short comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Okay, Ms. Owen and then Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| I would just like to suggest to board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| that if there are very specific circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| if we will call and talk with Jason Myers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| he will be very glad to look into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Sometimes he already knows all of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and can explain exactly what went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| But if we have specific circumstance questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| he is very glad to look at that and investigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| and find out what actually went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6047)|
| 1:40:47| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Yes, this is in response to Ms. Bounds' comment earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| which I think is very valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| about bringing this conversation back to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| I'm not necessarily talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| or that we talk about quarantine all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| but I think in a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| I think it would be prudent of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| to ask for more regular briefings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| from the health department or the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| I don't think that has to be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| I don't think it always has to be dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| but five minutes every work session or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| where you can get information everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| And I think it's important for us as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| to have a consistent line of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| I certainly don't wanna have the level of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| that Mr. Myers is having in his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| I mean, I do not feel like I need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| But having some regular briefing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| where we have a more macro level understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| especially when we're engaging in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| and the community is engaging in us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| gauging us, I think we'll feel a little bit more confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| not trying to put ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| in the position of a health expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| but to at least have some dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| and be a little bit more confident in those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| And I think along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| when we do need to make decisions and pivot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| we'll feel like we're not playing so much of a catch up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| All right, thank you all for the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Dr. Buchanan, thank you for making time to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| and to have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| We appreciate it and we appreciate your partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| And Ms. Coatney, I'll turn it back over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6133)|

| 1:43:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6240)|

| 1:44:19| We have a motion by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| Ms. Christie, was that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6263)|

| 1:44:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Okay, we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| a second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Yes, I have an amendment to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Okay. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| An amended motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Yes. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| That I would like to put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| So this motion reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| the motion to approve the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| and superintendent's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| to adopt the schematic design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| for Lonsdale Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| to include an additional six classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| for a total of 36 regular instruction classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| Okay, we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Okay, Ms. Christie seconds that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Because she originally seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| so she seconds your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| Okay, and discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| Did you want to say anything, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Mr. Dillingham, if we add those additional six classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| I know the capacity is to add 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| We could add 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| and I know there's reasons not to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| for green space and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Does it prevent us from adding those additional four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| sometime in the future from a construction standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| or does it make it significantly more difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Mr. Watson, it's still possible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| The difficulty comes in if a playground is put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| and we're going to have to do something with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| to move it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| I'm not sure that in reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| that with these additional classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| that are being added now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| that we would ever have to revisit Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| and add on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| Also, do you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| I know there's no way to tell until the pricing goes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| but in your full body of experience doing these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| do you have some rough idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| Is it to the same square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| that is presented in the current project budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| that we would be adding to the overall cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| for these additional six classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| And if so, what is that on a maximum square foot basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| I will tell you this, day and time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| I cannot find anyone that will guess on construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| You know, the budget that was provided for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| was actually put together as a greenfield project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| not anticipating that it was going to be put on the city park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and that we would have to incur the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| of demolishing the existing building and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| So at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| I actually told the contractor the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| that adding these six classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| that we're offering $32.50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| but he didn't like that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| So the current budget is roughly $160,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| or $160 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Do you see any reason, obviously it could come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| that it would be significantly greater than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| I can name a number of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| that it may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| I don't know how significant it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| One is the storm shelter that we're now required to put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| That was not included in the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| Again, anecdotally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| we're looking at a little bit less than 100,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| with this addition we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| Anecdotally, I've heard from Middle Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6487)|
| 1:48:11| that adding storm shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| on a 100,000 square foot building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| was adding roughly a million dollars to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| between a million and 1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| So you're looking at 10 to $12 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| I guess I want to clarify my question a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Does the existing classrooms are going to have some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| the existing approved classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| are going to have some basic value per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| There's no reason from a construction standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| the way these additional classrooms are going to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| that those would bear any more cost per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| than the currently designed rooms, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| If it is added on the front end prior to construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| it would be basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| And that's to my second point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| If we build these later, it will be higher, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Okay, that's the point I was going after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6541)|
| 1:49:01| Is that it, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Okay, thank you, Ms. Pab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| And this is a Mr. Dillingham question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| because we talked about this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| The storm shelter you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| has nothing to do with the six extra classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| That's going to be an incurred expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| with or without these six extra classrooms, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| So it's an expense we are going to have to incur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| We know that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| We know it's more expensive than we originally counted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| And then these six classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| will just be the additional expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| of six additional classrooms to be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Now is definitely the time to add the six classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| because including it in the overall project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| as we build it is going to be the least expensive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6577)|
| 1:49:41| that we could ever do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Thank you, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I just want to reiterate the emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| of included community input in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| as we continue to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| so that they can have a sense of ownership for this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| because we know that when people are involved in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| and have a sense of ownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| it's taken care of a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| And so just, I don't want to continue to neglect the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| that will benefit from this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| The original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Okay, so we need to go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6624)|
| 1:50:40| Okay, so the motion's been amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| So that was to approve the amendment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6643)|
| 1:50:45| Now we need to go back and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| The six extra classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| So if you vote yes, you're voting to add the six classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| Okay, so all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| Item 13J, discussion about extracurricular groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| from the points of fairness and equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| I just wanted us to talk briefly about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| I guess a lot of these things that we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| or think about would fall under the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| They're all extracurricular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| but I want us to see if we can come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| with a way that we can treat everybody fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| And if they don't have to wear a mask for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| then they shouldn't have to wear a mask for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| Just two things, uniformity and simple fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6716)|
| 1:52:05| And I will, if we need to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6725)|
| 1:52:11| I will do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| but I would like to hear what the superintendent has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| As well as the board, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Yes, thank you, Mr. McMillan, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| This is an issue that we've been discussing as staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| our leadership team over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| And families, and I know you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| families have been asking us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| allowing arts groups, clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| and other extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| that have been limited because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| And this is, we're going into the next few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6761)|
| 1:52:43| well, the next several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| beginning with obviously with December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| through spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| And our athletic teams have been competing this fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| using a protocol that we adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| And I think it's been fairly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| We've had some issues obviously with some of the teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| but overall I think it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| And just like athletics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| we recognize that the arts and extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| are an important part of our educational mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6791)|
| 1:53:15| And these activities help build relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| They also help students to develop lifelong skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| I'll give you a personal example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| My own physician was a product of my wife's program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| at Central High School for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| And during one of my exams, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| you know, your wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| the four years of your wife taught me so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and that's allowed me to be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| in my medical career even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| So the work ethic and the teamwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| and what it takes to have a successful choir program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| was certainly, I mean, for him to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| he's been practicing medicine for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| done a very good job because I'm still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| And so I think it is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| that we consider allowing students now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| as we move into the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| to have these opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| because they're kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| for many of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| And so with this in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| I wanted to tell the board and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| that we're working on a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| that would align with our existing plan for athletics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| I think as Mr. McMillan mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6859)|
| 1:54:20| in fairness, that we need to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| So, and I do believe that the last two and a half months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| that we've had in-person instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| has helped us to implement health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| and safety measures in our buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| And we know more now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| we have a little bit better sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| about how to promote the core actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| to prevent the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| So as we've had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| So what I would like to propose is that we provide to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6883)|
| 1:54:46| so I don't think it takes board action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| but provide to you a plan by the end of next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| that would allow us to enter into the next several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| with in-person performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6895)|
| 1:54:58| in-school performances and in-school activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| So that's comments I wanted to share with you, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| Great, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Thank you, I know we've gotten a lot of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| and concerns about this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| So I appreciate you looking into that and working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| Any other comments on that, Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Yeah, and while we're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6918)|
| 1:55:19| I know, and maybe Ms. Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| I don't want to put you on the spot, can speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| but there have been maybe some student requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| at L&N for an event that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| Thank you, Ms. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Yeah, anyway, so I go to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| that doesn't have like football, basketball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| So it's been difficult for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| I'm part of the SGA to kind of plan events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| that we would normally have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| that really bring our student body together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| because we don't have that kind of sports centric event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| that would kind of provide a school spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| So we normally have events like luau's or game nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| that we can have, and we're not able to have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| And so we've been feeling kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| other schools are having these sports events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| and there are other schools like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| that are not being allowed to have events because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| So we just kind of feel like there's an unfairness there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| since there are events being held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| and then we're not allowed to have ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| Okay, thank you for sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| So we can take that into account also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| And I think also, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6977)|
| 1:56:22| would you be including maybe a look at clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| and those kinds of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6986)|
| 1:56:27| as we move forward toward the next semester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-201111?start=6987)|
