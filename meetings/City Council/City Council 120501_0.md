| 0:01:54| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| For the Mayor's Report, first I'd like to welcome everybody here tonight and also all those who are watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=118)|
| 0:02:05| I've got a couple of things to report to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| First, I want to thank everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| We had 700 or 800 people come out for the budget luncheon on Friday, and I want to thank everybody who did come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| And now City Council has the budget, and they'll start their hearings soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| When will that be? May 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| May 22nd, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| And 23rd, Council will be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| And those should be on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| Where's Mr. York?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| I believe all the budget documents should be on our city website, cityofknoxville.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| So I invite everyone to take a look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| I do want to report that yesterday we kicked off a new initiative from our Parks and Recreation Department called Let's Move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=166)|
| 0:02:53| and it is a campaign to fight the epidemic of childhood obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| and it is part of a national campaign that is led by First Lady Michelle Obama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| Locally, we have quite a few partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| I just want to recognize a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Our county school system through the Coordinated School Health Specialist, Anissa McDonald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| the Knoxville Track Club, Christy Altman's been involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| the Knox Area Coalition on Childhood Obesity, and our Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| And this group is going to actually have a kickoff event this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| at both the Victor Ash Park and at the Holston-Chelhowee Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| And this is some activities for children, things like soccer, karate, obstacle courses, track and field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=220)|
| 0:03:50| jump rope, shuttle runs, worm bins, make your own trail mix, seed planting, and many more activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| And at, let's see, at 12 noon, at 2 p.m., they will be doing a Let's Move flash mob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=238)|
| 0:04:06| and the kids have been and teachers at the schools have been preparing the kids to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| I know you'll all want to be there, and perhaps council should participate in the Let's Move flash mob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=251)|
| 0:04:19| Also, just want to acknowledge quickly a few of the sponsors for that, Walgreens, Moonwalks and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| Home Depot, B97.5, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Subway are all involved, so we certainly appreciate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=265)|
| 0:04:32| and hope a lot of families will come out for that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Also, I wanted to ask Kay Graybiel, who is the Historic Preservation Planner for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| She is going to give us a very brief overview of the annual preservation report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| and this is something that our city charter requires us to receive annually in MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| and our Historic Preservation Planner prepares that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| So, Kay, if you'd like to introduce yourself and give us your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| As the mayor mentioned, I'm Kay Graybiel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| I'm the Historic Preservation Planner for the Knox-Knoxville MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I'm pleased to submit this report as a summary of preservation activities for the year 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I'd like to take a brief moment just to hit some of the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| The Historic Zoning Commissioners listed on the slide before you are those that served during the calendar year 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| and as you can see, this very busy commission included now council member Finbar Sanders as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| As of January 2012, Mr. Scott Busby is serving as chair and Ms. Sandra Martin as vice chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| and we also have a new member, Mr. Jason Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Improvement projects reviewed by the commission and staff members last year totaled 115,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| which is slightly up from 104 during the calendar year 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| So it's good news that renovation activities has held its own over the last few tough economic years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| The report also highlights the National Register nominations of buildings by the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| as well as renovation activities throughout the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| This activity, coupled with that of potential for school building renovations such as that of Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| makes it very apparent that adaptive reuse of historic buildings is synonymous with economic development in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| The presentation of this report is well-timed since May is National Historic Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| This year's nationwide theme is Discover America's Hidden Gems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| You can visit our website at knoxnpc.org under the Historic Preservation tab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| to see a list of treasured historic districts and properties to explore and celebrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| I'd like to introduce Kim Trent, executive director of Knox Heritage, if she is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| just to take a brief moment to highlight events that they are sponsoring to celebrate National Historic Preservation Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| And if she hasn't been able to make it, I do have a slide for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| I just got here 30 seconds ago, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| That was down to the wire. We had our executive committee meeting at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| So I want to thank all of you for all the support you've given to preservation in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| and let you know about some exciting events we have this month that are open to Knoxvillians and Knox Countians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| and actually all of East Tennessee where we work now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| On May the 15th, we will release our Fragile 15 list, the most endangered properties in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| And that will be at Bennett Galleries at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| And I'm going to pass around postcards so you'll all have your list of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| We're also launching, and we're very thrilled about this, finally, a downtown walking tour for downtown Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| I should have done that years ago. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| It's been years in the making, a lot of research and a lot of effort from many, many people who put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| We'll have free walking tours on May 19th at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. starting at the Visitor Center for anyone who wants to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| And the brochures are free and will be available in locations all over downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| So we hope that you will come and join us that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| And then we're having a special Lost and Found Luncheon on May the 22nd, which will be at the Square Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| And it is the cost of lunch to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| But we'll have a panel discussion on the Civil War sites that are still existing in Knoxville today and that we are striving to preserve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=504)|
| 0:08:33| So thank you all so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| I'll start these on either side and pass them around, and we hope to see you at our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| It's a great month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| And Knoxville is a national leader in preservation and recognized as such all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Councilman Dalibolfi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Kim, before you leave, or if you're still there, is that walking tour also going to be on the website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| Since someone may not be able to go downtown and get the brochure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| but they can sure plug into their magic assistant they have these days and follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| You can go to knoxheritage.org slash tours, and we have tours for downtown, and we'll be adding audio and video features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| Jack Neely has provided podcasts for 12 of the locations downtown with the financial support of Scripps Networks, which we're grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=559)|
| 0:09:29| And so you can see online, but we also have other neighborhoods from Island Home to Sequoia Hills to Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=569)|
| 0:09:36| There are neighborhood tours available on our website, so you can see photographs, read history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| A little map, too, so you can do your own walking tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| We have Google Maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| And we'll soon roll out PDFs similar to this for all of those neighborhood tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Can I download an app, walking tours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| We don't have an app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Those cost a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| But we do have a website, and so you can go and look at those on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| And one of the reasons why we are known nationally for our historic preservation efforts is because of you, Kim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| and your board and your volunteers and members of Knox Heritage, so we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=608)|
| 0:10:21| Okay, and so, Kay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| And you all know, of course, we knew Ann Bennett, who was in the preservation planner role for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| and it's nice to have Kay here since Ann decided to retire on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| Okay, so now reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=643)|

| 0:10:47| Yes, thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| I just wanted to announce that we will be holding a workshop this Thursday in this assembly room at 5.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| to further discuss the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=655)|

| 0:11:34| So I've ordered good weather for that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=694)|

| 0:11:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Vice Mayor, I mean, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I want to thank you and your staff for the ribbon-cutting ceremony that was held on yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| and somewhat in conjunction with historic preservation at the Oddfellows Cemetery on Bethel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| And that is an historic African-American cemetery, and the city has cleared that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| It's looking very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And also with a new street paving there on Kyle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| and a curb to prevent flooding that was taking place in that cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| And also I want to announce on Thursday at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| KCDC will be having a community forum at Walter P. Teller in the Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=756)|

| 0:12:50| and the Oddfellows Cemetery and the Eastport Residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=770)|

| 0:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| I just wanted to remind you that May is also Bike Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| and we're having a ride Monday night at 6 o'clock, and we're leaving the Winsong Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| It's a ride with elected officials, and everybody's invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| and we're going to ride from Winsong Park up to West Hills and then turn around and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=796)|

| 0:13:39| 6 o'clock Monday at Winsong Theaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| I just wanted to thank David Brace and the guys at the public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| There's a crew out there that has been helping us with the Tank Strickland Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| There's a section that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| The city has partnered with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| It's technically a county park because the library is on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| but eventually the three nasty old buildings have been torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| A section of the park was done about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| and right now the neighborhood is working with the public service guys to get some dirt spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| We're seeding it and strawing it, and it's going to be green for the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| and we're really thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| You know, those guys come out there and they may punch a clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| or get paid somewhat by the hour, but they really take ownership of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| and when they get out there they make it their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| They go out of their way to do it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| and I was really impressed with their service and their commitment to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| and I just wanted to thank them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I think that shows what great employees we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Councilwoman Palmer, I'd like to thank you for coming back to the third district to announce your budget on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| We were thrilled to have you there, and also to the crew who made the park look beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| It really does look like that most of the time, but it looked exceptionally good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| And to Vice Mayor Pavlis, who listened to me and worked on that sunny day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| I also have another announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| On Thursday, May the 10th, the Westview community will be meeting to review plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| to create the Westview Historical Cemetery District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| There are six cemeteries in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| One is maintained by the Lowness family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| The other five are not as well maintained, I guess, is the way to phrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| And we have all, most of us have contributed some money to get a design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| The Sheriff's crew has been working to clean out the hillsides and make it an attractive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| And so on Thursday, May the 10th, 7 p.m., at the Westview Wesleyan Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| the plans will be presented for moving forward to take the next steps in making this a historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Just wanted to get an update on the mulch situation and also on our shingles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| So I'm going to call on Chief Sharp first to talk about the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| We ceased, we finished our emergency operations last Friday at the mulch site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| And then as soon as that was over, our fire marshal's office visited the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| and put some restrictions or requirements on the future of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| The most significant one is that the owner has to come up with a fire protection plan designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| and stamped by a fire protection engineer and then approved by the fire marshal's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| before he can, before the city will continue any operations with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| In the meantime, until he does come up with that, we've put several other restrictions in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| Probably the most significant one is that he must maintain a 24-hour fire watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| seven days a week, 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| And that includes very specific things that they have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| walk the site every 30 minutes and keep a log and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Also have to improve fire department access on the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| and greatly reduce the piles and increase the separation between those piles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| So those temporary measures are in place right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| until the fire protection plan is submitted and approved by the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| Mayor, do we have any idea what it has cost the city so far as far as this whole event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| Christy, can you answer that? Christy Branscom, our senior director of public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Yeah, the only thing I would add to what Chief Sharp's comments is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| we're also going to be requiring a stormwater management plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| that's also going to be attached to the fire protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and hopefully be incorporated into contractual terms with Shamrock to help protect the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| Right now, I think there was about $30,000 in tipping fees that the city did incur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| for the work that was required in getting the brush off of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| But in terms of the total cost, we don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| No, we don't have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| We're still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Shamrock has it within 10 cents, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Okay, and any other questions on that, on the mulch, before we move on to the shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Does that mean you're no longer accepting brush there until he comes up with the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| Right, we're no longer accepting brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| We're not taking brush there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| He's no longer accepting our brush there until the plan has been submitted to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| and then approved by us, by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| So where's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| It's being diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| You guys passed an emergency measure, right, for 30 days at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1143)|
| 0:19:16| Actually, I think that just Voice was able to sign that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Shingles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Ready for an update on the shingles saga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| When last we left this story, the Chancery Court had entered an order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| which prohibited any further shingles from being brought on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| It also required the persons who were operating those two sites to present to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1177)|
| 0:19:45| Actually, they required them to submit to us a plan for getting rid of those shingles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| for abating the nuisance and the zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Rather than do that, they left town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| They were not from here and have returned from whence they came, I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| But they are no longer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| As a result of that, the owners of the two locations have gone to court, each of them have gone to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| and obtained an order essentially evicting them from the site, even though they left before they were evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| That left us with the necessity of now dealing with the owners to deal with this both nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| and violation of our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| And they were very cooperative to come in and sit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| About three weeks ago, they came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Both sets of owners came in and we talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And I asked them to put together a written plan for us as to how they were going to get rid of the shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| and abate that nuisance and get rid of the zoning violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| They have, in fact, complied with that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| and have both furnished to us a plan for doing that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| And the good news, the very good news with regard to each of the plans was that both planned to get rid of the shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| by recycling them rather than taking them and dumping them in a landfill somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| So we were pleased about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| We had encouraged them to give strong consideration to finding a solution to this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| that would allow them to recycle these materials that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| And they were cooperative in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| More good news with regard to the west site, the western site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| At that site, the owner has sent to us a plan that essentially will have all the shingles gone from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1294)|
| 0:21:44| by the fall of this year in a very prompt and reasonable fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| through a process where the shingles will be recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| On the other hand, we got a proposal from the owners of the eastern site that also involved recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1316)|
| 0:22:06| but was not nearly so timely nor prompt in the getting rid of the shingles and abating the nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| Their timeline was something more along the line of three, three-and-a-half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| And so today, after receiving their proposal, we have sent them a copy of the west plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1338)|
| 0:22:28| and we have asked them, we have suggested to them that it might be better if they dealt with that on a more prompt basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| than the three years that they had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So there's ongoing activity in dealing with that east site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| We're not done with it yet, but neither are we ignoring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| And we're planning to move forward to get rid of those shingles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| and make those areas come back into compliance with our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| 9A is an ordinance amending Chapter 15, Article 2, subsections 15, 51, 57, 58, and 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| of the Knoxville City Code relating to the nondiscrimination policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| for the hiring and employment practices of City of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| I also have two speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Would you like to hear from the speakers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| First speaker is Peter McKee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| Good evening, Mayor Ruggiero and City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| My name is Pete McKee, and I am a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| I forgot to tell you, you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I hope it won't take nearly that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| I'm a manager at Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I work in the BB&T Tower where our global primary products business unit is headquartered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| It's a $10 billion a year business, and it's one of the major business units within Alcoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| Alcoa has been committed to equality in the workplace for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| but it's been the last three to five years under the direction of our chief executive officer, Klaus Kleinfeld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| where we have really stepped up to the mark and made equality in the workplace a very focal point of the way we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1455)|
| 0:24:25| Alcoa has affinity groups that support women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQ employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| From Alcoa's perspective, the labor market is very competitive, and in today's economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| we as a business cannot afford to eliminate or discourage any talented individuals for working for our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| So it is a very clear business case, but there is also a very clear human case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1488)|
| 0:24:54| It's 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| The time to stop bigotry and hatred and prejudice is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| I am proud to see that my company has taken the position it has with regard to equality and inclusion in the workplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| and I am also glad to see the city of Knoxville take steps in that direction also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| Ben Byers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And, Ben, just restate your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| And you'll also have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| My name is Ben Byers, 915 Claybrook Court, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I am here representing all of these people and also the Tennessee Equality Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| and I'd like to very first off thank counsel for the vote two weeks ago in the first reading of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| and Mayor Rojero for her support in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| This ordinance is a big step forward for a community that has, especially in recent times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| and historically, struggled to find acceptance in a lot of areas, employment being a big one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| It's also a huge step forward, I think, for the city to say a lot of what our friend from Alcoa said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| that it is a competitive job market, and the city needs to have the best people for the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| and those are the most qualified people and the people who will care the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| and do the best job regardless of what their various minority statuses or majority statuses may be across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1580)|
| 0:26:29| And we'd just really like to thank you for your support in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| and we hope it's the first step in a great partnership of making equality front and center as part of what Knoxville can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| And I've been asked really briefly if the people who are here supporting could quietly stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| We've got a lot of people who came out tonight to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| and they really wanted to let you guys know how much they appreciate the opportunity to put this issue in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Thank you, Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1617)|
| 0:27:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| I just simply wanted to thank you for bringing this item forward and getting it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| I know you have spoken to every single council representative, or at least I think you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| and I thank you for your support and your pro-action in bringing this to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| So I fully intend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Oh, Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| I just wanted to reiterate what the guest speaker said and Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you for bringing this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| I think it's a very good policy for three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| One, it's a good policy for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| Two, I hope that private firms in the area will follow suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| and adopt it in their own discrimination policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And three, I think it's hopefully it will be a sign to people in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| and in the region that Knoxville is a place that embraces and celebrates diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| So I just want to thank you for your leadership in bringing this to us in such a prompt manner in your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1698)|
| 0:28:39| I would just like to personally thank Council for your support on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| You all have been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1724)|
| 0:28:59| 11A is a resolution to adopt a plan for the Knoxville City Council Internet Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| I just wanted to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| I know the County Commission has this forum set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| and I thought that it would be a good idea to mirror that practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| I think we obviously should always be open and let folks see our thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| and sometimes we have thoughts after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| So this would be a great way to be able to exchange information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| or make comments or whatever under the Sunshine Law with everyone watching us, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| But, you know, it may be used, may not be used, but I think it's a good policy to have it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| It will probably be at the end of June before it's up and functioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| and, of course, we'll have, you know, announcements leading up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| The IT Department is tied up in a major project, I think, with KPD right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| so we'll take a backseat to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| and hopefully have some more information as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1805)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Councilman Dahlbocki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| I just want to thank Vice Mayor Pavlis for getting this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| You know, this is a job that you can't be in all the places you need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| and we all find out that if something's happening in their district as opposed to another district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| the person who's on the scene has a lot of times more factual information that needs to be shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| so people can do their own due diligence and investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| And this is going to be, I think, a good tool to help all the council people be focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| and ready to discuss the issues when they get to the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| And you can't do it all the time on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| You need time to look at it, to think about it, to chew on it, to further investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| And this is a healthy step to keeping us all informed, so I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Now, City Council Attorney Rob Frost tells me that I need to ask if there's anybody in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| who wants to speak to this that may not have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Is there anybody that would like to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| Seeing none, I believe I still need a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Did somebody want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| This is to the issue of an Internet forum for council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1893)|
| 0:31:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| My name is Beth Maples-Bay, and I have low vision, and I'm unable to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| And meeting with my council members is very difficult as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And this would give me a way to communicate with you without having to be mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1914)|
| 0:32:04| Thank you, Ms. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Actually, my understanding is that this will be just a way you can see how council members may communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1925)|
| 0:32:13| with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| You know, by sunshine law, they can't talk to one another unless it's in a public setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| So you would not be able to actually e-mail them on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| but you can see the conversation that's going on among council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| But you can still they're all available by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| And so I would hope that there will be a link on the site that would also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| if you want to directly communicate with one of the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you for bringing that up because we want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I need a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to delegate authority to act as certifying officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| for environmental reviews of exempt and categorically excluded activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| in connection with the receipt of federal funds from the United States Department of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and Urban Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| 11C is a resolution to adopt the Knox County City of Knoxville and Town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| multi-jurisdictional local hazard mitigation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| Go ahead, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I would like to just make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I've already talked to the Department of Engineering about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| In reading the plan, which was complete and exhaustive and exhausting reading it, there was ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| We'll take that as a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Oh, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| 240 pages of joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| It was thorough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| The schools were not present, and I'm told they were asked to be present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| and chose not to be for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| But it seems to me in any plan, especially of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| they just simply must have a part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| They're way too big a piece of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| But that's just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| The emphasis in this iteration of this plan was more on the technical side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| the definition of the issue, and documentation of current programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| As you said, schools were invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| They didn't see a role for themselves, so they didn't get involved much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2071)|
| 0:34:38| And Councilwoman Palmer also mentioned that the public participation side could have been stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2078)|
| 0:34:51| But, again, the emphasis was on the technical side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| Perhaps the next iteration, five years out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| there will be more of a function for public input per school participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| And bear in mind this is hazard mitigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| This is not emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| This is about how you stop flooding from happening, right, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Flooding, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| Flooding was identified as the hazard that was most readily addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2114)|
| 0:35:24| that had the most need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| The projects involved here, the processes involved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| were pretty technical as far as the solutions that are being explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| And there was, of course, a lot of participation from Knox County, City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| and Farragut and the various agencies inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| and they all have a lot of interactions with both the public and the schools as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| So they were, in a way, indirectly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| And as we get into this process, this being the first iteration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| it's quite likely that there will be more involvement in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Councilman Dallavalpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Yeah, I was going to thank the guys for their thoroughness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| but maybe suggest that in addition to the one that you're going to submit to FEMA that's over 200 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| maybe you could have like a 25-page executive version that people can pick up and read the highlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| because it is somewhat exhausting to curl up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| 11D is a resolution expressing appreciation to the Knoxville Firefighters Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| for the donation of $13,237.54 to be used for the purchase of supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| for the Knoxville Fire Department's Learn Not to Burn Program in order to educate children about fire safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I would like just to recognize that we have Kevin Faddis here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| who's the president of the Firefighters Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| and we appreciate the money that you all raise and donate for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| I am sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| You are signed up to speak, so go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| That was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| That's twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street, president of the Firefighters Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Madam Mayor, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Members of Council, I want to thank you for giving the Firefighters Association an opportunity to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| And I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| I just wanted to give you a couple of numbers that we have, large numbers, just to put that in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| Some of the education classes that we've had to the public right now, well, as of November, is 988 classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2273)|
| 0:38:04| Participants in those classes are over 16,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| November, like I said, they're around November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| So far, since 2008, we've had over 39,000 second-grader students, pre-K, I'm sorry, to attend these classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2292)|
| 0:38:24| So it's a large group of children that we're trying to teach, learn not to burn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2304)|
| 0:38:33| Like I said, our organization, part of that is smoke detectors for elderly, people that cannot manage their smoke detectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| need batteries changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| In the community, we go out and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We also have a program for burnouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| If there's a fire in the city or even around the area, around the region, we help monetarily help them get back on their feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| Like I said, it's an honor for us as part of the Firefighters Association to help the city in this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| And, Kevin, the next time you're signed up to speak, just come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I won't be able to avoid seeing you then, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Just come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I write it big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| I promise I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply jointly with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| for an Edward Byrne Grant Award of $177,294 from the U.S. Department of Justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2371)|
| 0:39:38| for improved operation of the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| and if such application is approved, authorizing the mayor to accept such a grant award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Saunders Pace Architecture, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2394)|
| 0:40:00| for electrical renovations of the Jacob Building at Chilhowee Park for an amount not to exceed $51,029.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| I see that we have Bob Polk and Rick Evans here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| but I just wanted to say that this request for money to work with the architect on the electrical renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2415)|
| 0:40:22| of the Jacobs Building is something that's been sort of approved as part of the capital budget plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| and it's something that's been deferred for the last five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| When they did the Jacobs Building over, it just was going to be too expensive to do everything they needed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| so they did some minor fixes to the electrical system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| but this is going to be an attempt to bring it all up to code and to make it work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2442)|

| 0:44:40| I'm the president of a young manufacturing company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| and we have invented a new way to build a house, a new bicycle, a new TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2683)|

| 0:45:15| and large companies to let their employees go for two 50-minute walks per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| Companies pay nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| The employees pay $5 a week, which is nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| and we're going to break these thousands of people into little groups of 10 and assign a personal trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| That is the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2733)|

| 0:46:13| I'm hoping that Channel 10 will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| If we want things to happen in this country, I hope some people will take a little effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| and come to the inaugural walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| It starts the 14th of May when people come to work and walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil120501?start=2784)|
