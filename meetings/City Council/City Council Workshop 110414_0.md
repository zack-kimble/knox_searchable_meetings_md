| 0:05:01| Before I get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| I would like to introduce members of the community development staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=302)|

| 0:05:20| And I thank all of them for being here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and all the great work they do on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| I didn't miss anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| I got everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| The purpose of our workshop today is to give you an overview of our department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| our goals, programs, and funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| to review our proposed annual action plan, which begins July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| to give you a brief highlight and update of the programs that we're working on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| and then to answer any questions you've got on our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| Our department mission is to revitalize low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| and moderate-income communities and to strengthen all city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| And we accomplish this mission by working with multiple partners throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| on many programs with various federal, state, and local funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| Our desired outcomes are safe, sustainable, and vibrant neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| decent, affordable, healthy, and energy-efficient housing, accessible and fair housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| economic opportunities for individuals and businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| active public participation through strong neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| and responsive and collaborative partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| You have before you an organizational chart of our department in your handouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=410)|
| 0:06:58| but basically we have several sub-offices within the Department of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| We have an Office of Disability Services, an ADA Compliance, an Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| our Fair Housing Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| We have a Housing Section, Economic Development Section, and a Grants Administration Section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=434)|
| 0:07:21| In total, we have 22 full-time employees, one part-time, and two interns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=441)|
| 0:07:30| one's paid and one's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| And in August, we'll be getting a social work, master's level student intern, voluntary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=452)|
| 0:07:40| to work with us for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| So this is going to be a new placement for the School of Social Work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| And that person will be working on the vacant properties program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| So this is really small on your screen, but you do have a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| These are our priorities as developed in the five-year consolidated plan that we worked on last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| We, if you recall, for those who were on council last year and those who are new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| every five years the city has to develop a five-year plan that outlines how we're going to address the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| and other neighborhood needs in the community with our HUD funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| So we do a lot of research and data gathering and talking to a lot of different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| and service providers in the community and develop a five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| These are our goals and objectives for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| And if you see on the far left, the federal objectives are what our funds have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| Those are federal objectives designed for the HUD funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| So it's either to provide decent housing, create a suitable living environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| or create economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| And those federal objectives are primarily focused on persons of low income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| and low income neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| Within those objectives, our goals focus on, for housing, homeownership, rental housing, and homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| And within each of those categories, you see what our specific objectives are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| and then what the priority level is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| Basically, we are trying to increase the supply, the quality energy efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| access, and supply of visitable housing for homeownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| We are about increasing the supply of energy efficient, fair, and affordable rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| And for homelessness, increase the supply of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| access to permanent supportive housing, and provision of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| Under creating a suitable living environment, we really focus on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| So our programs that acquire blighted properties, deal with vacant properties, eliminate blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| deal with our neighborhood associations, and all those serve to strengthen and improve neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| Our economic opportunities are met with our business development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| through our business expansion loan program, our facade program, and other remediation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=632)|
| 0:10:40| So with that background, that framework is how we move forward to build our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=640)|
| 0:10:50| The annual action plan, what it does, it details how we will spend annual federal grants that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| through an entitlement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Those are CDBG, home, and emergency shelter grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| The plan itself is guided by the priorities I just spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| the needs of the target areas, and you'll see those in a minute, leveraging other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| We try to be proactive, not reactive, and we try to be progressive in future thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=676)|
| 0:11:25| So here are the target areas that were developed in the five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| It's very unclear up there on the screen, but I hope you can see them on your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| There are four areas surrounding the downtown Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Those are census tracts that were chosen based on income levels and housing needs within the four areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=700)|
| 0:11:53| The next issue that greatly affects how our annual plan is developed is funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| And we just received, I guess it was yesterday or the day before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| the amounts of decrease that's going to be in our budget for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| We don't have our final numbers yet and probably will not have them for another 30 days or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| but we do know the amount of decrease that we can anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| and it's 16% less in CDBG than last year and 12% less in home funds than last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| There will be a slight decrease in emergency shelter grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| but we don't know really what that percentage will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| So overall, if you calculate all the funds that we have to carry forward to the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| because some of this is carryover, some is program income we receive from paybacks on loans that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=770)|
| 0:12:58| but our bottom line budget is almost a million dollars less for the year starting July 1st than the year we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=778)|
| 0:13:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| You have a handout in front of you that's several pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| It's stapled together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| And I'm just going to walk you through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| It's called HUD Table 3A, Summary of Specific Annual Objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| Everybody have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| You'll see some little code letters on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Those align with those priorities that I talked about a minute ago, either decent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| suitable living environment, or economic opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| So the little D-H on the left, that's how that links together with those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=824)|
| 0:13:52| But the first project you'll see there is a city-operated project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| It's our owner-occupied housing rehab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| This is the largest project that we fund on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| We provide both CDBG and home funds for housing rehabilitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| and our goal is to accomplish 30 houses this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=853)|
| 0:14:21| We do not have any funds in the rental housing category for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| Under the CHODO projects, those are homes that are built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| or rehabbed by our local community housing development organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| such as Knox Housing Partnership and Neighborhood Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| We have a set-aside for those organizations every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| This year we're setting aside $210,000 and anticipate seven homes being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=888)|
| 0:14:59| Turn the page over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| CAC, Emergency Home Repair, we funded this project in the past, last year and the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| They provide emergency home repair services for a lot of families in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=911)|
| 0:15:21| Their waiting list is very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| They can never serve everybody who has this need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| but they get funds from the city and the county both to try to meet the needs that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| We hope to have 100 homes rehabilitated with our $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| and this is a decrease of $100,000 from last year because of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| Neighborhood Housing also provides a minor home repair program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| They do the work through volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| and our funds provide materials and supervision of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| We have decreased them as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| and we're hopeful to be able to give them $60,000 this year for 25 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| Disability Resource Center provides ramps and rails and home modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| to assist persons with disabilities to be able to get in and out of their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| We're funding them at $20,000, and that will provide 20 ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=979)|
| 0:16:26| Next category is our fair housing activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We are a fair housing assistance program, and as classified that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=990)|
| 0:16:40| we provide investigative services and determinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| on fair housing complaints within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| This office helps promote fair housing through education and outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| to landlords and tenant organizations, and we also have training events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| There's one tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| focuses on fair housing issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| and so it's a very important part of our office, and so FAP funds come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1029)|
| 0:17:17| That's always an estimate because we don't get those until later in the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| and then we provide CDBG funds as well to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| The next category, we're not providing any funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| to develop permanent supportive housing in the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| We do have a new category, which is homeless prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| It's case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| That's $100,000, and that's focused on the provision of case management services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| to prevent homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| So we hope to serve 100 people that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| CAC Homeward Bound provides direct assistance to persons who are facing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| or homeless persons to be able to obtain housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| They provide either down payment, not down payment, but rental deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1089)|
| 0:18:19| or utility deposits, things that would help families get into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| We've funded them in the past and will continue to fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Child and Family Crisis Center, we assist their shelter for homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| domestic violence victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| University of Tennessee HMIS is the management system for tracking the use of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| by homeless individuals, and we continue to fund them at $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Volunteer Ministry Center operates their day resource center and case management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1130)|
| 0:18:57| and we provide funds for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| YWCA provides a transitional shelter for women, and, again, we're going to assist them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| And Catholic Charities provides transitional housing for elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| and we're able to provide some funding for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| All the homeless service providers did apply for our funds this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| We had a round of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| We got in far more requests for funds than we have money to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| We got in several applications that were not eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| but we always open that up for a round of applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| The next category is affordability of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| We are not providing any operating funds for our CHOTOs this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| We are going to focus our down payment assistance program for the CHOTOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| So for CHOTOs that build houses and need assistance to get families into them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| they can tap into this resource of $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1201)|
| 0:20:10| On the next page, we're into the suitable living environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| These are projects that focus on neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| We're providing some funding to the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| We've done this in the past and will continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| although this is at a decreased level from the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| We have a small project amount for city community development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| Those are for cost overruns or unforeseen things that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| in some of these redevelopment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| And then blighted property acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| we have $150,000 to acquire parcels that are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| Under economic opportunity, our facade program provides loans to businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| to improve the exterior they're building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| It creates a lot of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| It creates economic development for the area where these take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| and we're funding that at $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| The last four projects are our administration and program delivery costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| and those are broken down into the categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| CDBG admin is capped at 20% of our funds received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and the home administration is capped at 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| So we have to work within what we can receive in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Our next steps, we still have the plan out for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| We will receive public comments through next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| We had our second annual meeting last Thursday and received comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| Also, any comments or questions you all have will be included in the annual plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| We will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| This will come before council May the 3rd, council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| and we will submit this to HUD by May 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And even though we probably won't have our actual numbers by that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| they still want us to turn it in with estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| So that's what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| And right now I'd just like to show you some of the projects that we've worked on in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| and talk a little bit about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| You've heard the different things that we focus funding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| This is our owner-occupied rehab program, the program I talked about that the city administers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1366)|
| 0:23:06| As you see on the left, 233 Kern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| That's before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| And on the right is after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| These houses are rehabbed up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| They meet neighborhood standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| And the owner-occupants enter into a loan agreement with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| and pay us back for the work that's there over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| This is how we receive some of our program income is through those loan repayments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| As you see, there's one there on Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Not only for that homeowner, but for the street as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| It makes a big difference to the whole streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| Replacement homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Sometimes houses are too far gone for us to even rehabilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| And we are allowed, if the cost of rehab exceeds a certain amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| we can totally demolish that house and rebuild on that site a new house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| So these are two examples of replacement houses, one on Glenwood, before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| and one on Trescott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| So it makes a very big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| The one there on Glenwood, I would like to add, if you can see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| it has some solar panels on the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| And that's our first solar water heater that we installed, solar-powered water heater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| The next project is my front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| This was actually originally funded with Empowerment Zone funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| and we are continuing that this year with CDBG funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| But this is a residential facade program that provides a forgivable loan to the homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| so that exterior improvements can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| The loans are up to $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| They don't exceed $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| But as you can see, houses are dramatically improved, either with painting or porch details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1501)|
| 0:25:09| Sometimes it could be roofs, landscaping, driveways, things that really make a big difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1509)|
| 0:25:17| not just for the family but for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| That one right there is on Linden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| As you can see, they actually built a little front porch covering over the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1524)|
| 0:25:34| This is some chronic problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| This is one of the acquisition projects that we administer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| And as you can see, both of these houses were in very bad condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| They were condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| They were certified blighted through the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| and they were both resold through the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| And now the one on Chickamauga is a rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| and the one on Luttrell, which was really a blight to the 4th and Gill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| is now owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1571)|
| 0:26:18| A couple more pictures of Luttrell there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| As you can see, the back of Luttrell was just in really bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| I think there had been a fire there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| It's now rebuilt, has a beautiful deck, and just wanted to show you the interior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| what's been done to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1597)|
| 0:26:44| Also, I wanted to show you a couple of pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| These houses actually did not have to be acquired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| but because of our process of going through the Chronic Problem Property Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| and determining houses blighted, we were able to inspire the owners to fix these up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| So at no cost to the city other than a little of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and effort to try to get them through the process, both of these have been rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| You can see the one on Hannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| It doesn't really show how bad that was, but if you know the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| that was a very blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| That's been fixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| It is occupied, and the one on Dedrick is an extreme improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| Both of those happened just because of the work we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| These are some pictures of facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| The first one's on Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| That's the Terminex building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| The sign you see on the after, they actually found that sign under that mansard roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| When they took that off, that was there, so they reused it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| There's the building there on Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| There are actually three buildings there, so they have gotten three facade loans for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| but you can see just the stark difference that makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| This is in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| The one on Martin Mill that was vacant, just a big barn-like looking building that had nothing in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1697)|
| 0:28:26| now has rocky top heating and air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| It's located in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| And then the lower picture on Martin Mill, that's not occupied right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| but the plan is for those spaces to be leased out to small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| and that's right in the heart of downtown Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| The last picture I want to show you is the Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| that we provided to Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| The before, you certainly can see, and I'm sure all of you remember how bad that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and now it is completed and has very nice apartments for chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1742)|
| 0:29:13| Just to point out a few of our other projects that are not covered under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| as you remember a couple of years ago, we received stimulus funds through HERA and ERA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| two separate allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| We received Neighborhood Stabilization Program funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| and I put the deadline there to show you when those programs will end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Some of the programs that were funded with Neighborhood Stabilization include Menvilla, Flanagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| the Eastport School redevelopment, that's housing into senior units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1784)|
| 0:29:52| acquisition of blighted properties, and acquisition and rehab of foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| and we had three separate sub-recipients working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| We received homeless prevention and rapid rehousing funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| We have three projects underway there with CAC homeless prevention case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| That will be finished by the end of this calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| CAC Homeward Bound, which is complete, and Legal Aid of East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| which will be completed by the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And then our community development block grant recovery funds are funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| a Park City energy retrofit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| They have nine homes completed so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| And our commercial façade, that's actually funding the façade on Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| that you saw in the picture a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| And that will be completed very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| We also have received a $4.3 million sustainable communities regional planning grant from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| Our office serves as the grant administrator, Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| transportation planning organization is the lead planning agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| and you will see a sub-recipient agreement come to you probably, we're hoping in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| hopefully May 3rd, with them for about $3.4 million from this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| so that they can administer this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| They will hire consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| They will also manage the subcontracts with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and other partners who are providing services to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| And finally, just a few highlights from the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| We received an excellent review of our annual performance report from HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| We completed a new analysis of impediments to fair housing, which is a large document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| It's on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| And if you're interested, I can certainly get you a hard copy if you'd like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| We received the sustainable communities regional planning grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| It was a competitive grant, and we're one of a few in the country to receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| We implemented and monitored over 80 projects, hundreds of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| We completed the Empowerment Zone program, closed that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| used every penny of Empowerment Zone funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| We continued to work on the vacant properties campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| We've made tax foreclosure reform recommendations at the state level, and that is proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| We're actually backing up a little and focusing on full-scale tax foreclosure reform at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1954)|
| 0:32:44| We had some staff attend the Center for Community Progress Leadership Institute last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| We are one of four states, I believe, that have been chosen to participate with the Center for Community Progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1970)|
| 0:32:59| focusing on vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| We started a neighborhoods training program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| and we continued achievements in visitable, healthy, sustainable, and energy-efficient development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| And we are currently developing a Section 3 plan to promote employment of low-income persons and businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=1993)|
| 0:33:23| So with that, I think I've said enough for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| Questions and comments from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Ms. Wade, I have a question about the project that we had going in Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| And it seems like it was $500,000 for downtown Vestal, and it seems like it was part of the Empowerment Zone funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| And I was down there recently and couldn't tell if all of that ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| I know we had to spend all the money before it ran out because it's on a reimbursement basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Were all of our objectives achieved there, and did we spend that money in Vestal the way we intended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| What's the update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| I'm going to let Rogers give you that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| When we got into that project, we had some difficulties with some of the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Everything is very tight in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| We weren't able to complete the parking and some of the traffic lanes in front of Peace Furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| But we did accomplish the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| We have a parking lot that does not have a detention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| It actually has pavers that allow the water to park down into the substrate under the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| And that's a community parking lot, which was a great need down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| We have another parcel or two parcels we arranged that we filled and put sod on we'll use for a future development site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2083)|
| 0:34:52| That's where the road ran through to the Boys Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| We put a cul-de-sac there for the Boys Club buses to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| So we accomplished all of it we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| We couldn't get construction and slope easements for one of the owners that was in an ugly divorce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| But he has since that property next to Peace has been foreclosed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| and a businessman is about to renovate that with a new facade program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| So I think we accomplished most of it, and we probably never will finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| We did spend all the money, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| We redirected some of that money to other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| So some of the money was redirected to projects elsewhere in the city and not spent in Vestal ultimately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| Well, no, not entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| We used some money for facades in Vestal that we had planned to use on the street project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| And that was all Empowerment Zone money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| So the full half million was invested in Vestal when it was all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| just differently than the original plan was based on those kind of terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| And we're still continuing to work down there because the little barbershop and shoe shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| and beauty shop next to Peace is about to get a facade project loan that is not Empowerment Zone money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| So we'll continue to work down there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Good. And also, quickly, what's the update in Lonsdale at High School Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| That was kind of the last project in under the wire with Empowerment Zone funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and I haven't driven by there recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| We're going to go in and have some of Charlie Big's chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| And it's got a new Shell gas station where the Dadu Market was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| and you can use your Kroger card to get your points when you buy gas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| We're going to have a ribbon cutting on the 28th at 1 o'clock up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| And I hope you all can come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| It turned out to be a really good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| Good. I have another question, but I'll let my colleagues jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Becky, two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Under the priority need category homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| you mentioned a new category, case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| All the other categories list are partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Who's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| That is not determined at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| There are a couple of providers that do homeless prevention case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| Most notably is CAC, because they are doing the prevention of homelessness in the KCDC high-rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2224)|
| 0:37:14| They work directly with individuals that, without their intervention, could be evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| So they work directly with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| Most of them are elderly or disabled that are facing eviction without anywhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| So that's what those case managers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| So that's certainly one project that we might fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| Their HPRP money, their homeless prevention money, is funding that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| that we are providing to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| That will carry them through the end of this year, doing that same project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| And going back to the empowerment zone, so that is all done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| I thought that we had extended the contract with the Urban League to continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| The Urban League is continuing to operate the loan pool that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| So, yes, we have a contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| We don't have any more funds to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| So they are operating that for us, and they are putting the funds back into the loan pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| and then any of the interest and fees they can use for their administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| Anyone would like to speak during public forum, we have a sign-up sheet over here with Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Becky, along the same lines of some of these monies drawing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| I think you indicated it was roughly a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| You went from 4.8 to 3.8 of federal monies that you're administering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Is that the sole budget that you deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| or do you get additional monies that are not included in this analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| Some of our office of neighborhoods is funded with general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| My salary and my assistant's salary is funded with general funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| and the office of disabilities services is funded with general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Is this the lion's share, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, this is the lion's share of our operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| What ability will you have to do things like facade improvements if, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| the Magnolia Corridor project gets underway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| I know you've been doing stuff in downtown north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| and I'm just curious what is available for that activity going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Well, we've programmed some facade money in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| As you saw, I think it's $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| So we can do four facades with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| I mean, we also have some general fund dollars that we've requested in this year's budget for facades as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2395)|
| 0:40:04| So we have two streams of facade funds right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Is that a match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2408)|
| 0:40:09| No, it's not a match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| This is like a grant to get that done, the facade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| The reason we have two separate streams is the federal funds come with certain requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| like Davis-Bacon wage rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| which means that you have to have a fairly sophisticated contractor to be able to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| how those funds go to the employees, pay them the Davis-Bacon wage rates and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| We like to have general funds to be able to assist smaller entities that maybe cannot meet that Davis-Bacon requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2439)|
| 0:40:49| So even though someone might be willing to bid lower and do the work locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| you've got to pay those national or at least regional rates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| If it's funded with CDBG, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| That comes with the territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| And the 225, you said, would do four facades and not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| Well, we have some program income, program delivery funds built into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| because we have to staff time and some other things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Does any of that money turn out to be a revolving fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| or is it just expended to do the improvement and it's gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| There's no return of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| At this point, it has not come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| It's structured as a loan, but it is a forgivable loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| It's only 20% of the project cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| So you see the owner of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| The owner has got to come up with 80%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| It's backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| The owner puts in at least 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Oh, and we'll go up to 80 is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| We don't go over 50, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| 50,000 is the max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| So we'll go up to 80 but with a max of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| But what we've found is the owners are putting in far more than their 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| because most of the buildings that we're working on have been vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| and now they're getting fitted out on the interior for new tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| It's given us a big leverage as far as our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| Well, and I think when you start doing those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| you encourage people next door to take a better interest in their own properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| and so the whole area gets uplifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| It's certainly a healthy thing to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| to encourage that kind of revitalization of some of those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| My last question relates to kind of what Councilman Woodhall was asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| the homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| And I know that as the 10-year plan has been analyzed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| there's always been questions about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| or not city of Knoxville dollars were going to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| And the provision of case management services has always been a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| to folks, you know, once the buildings, Flanagan and Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| are funded and built, constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| then how do we deal with the sustainability of the counseling needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| the case management needs, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| And my understanding is the office of the permanent or the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| excuse me, the homeless office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Tenure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Tenure plan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| I couldn't even think what it was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Tenure plan office I believe had an income stream in their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| to pay for one full-time case management position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| And that office is now greatly reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| And so going into next year's budget, will that still be present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I understand that the line item that Councilman Woodhall asked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| is with CAC for prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| So that's not case management at Flanagan or at Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| So could you talk about that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I believe it's in the general fund budget to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| still have that case management position in the upcoming budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| through the tenure plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| But that's just one full-time person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| And so all the other case managers are being funded by our partners like VMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| or the one that's doing Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I wanted to ask you about the fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| And you have on the discrimination complaints you had 12 investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2666)|
| 0:44:34| If persons are found guilty, how does that play out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Do you or does your department carry it on to the judicial system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| Or what happens with that if people are found guilty of some type of fair housing complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| We have a fair housing hearings board that is appointed by the mayor that we meet with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2692)|
| 0:45:00| And we make recommendations as a department to the board if we find cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| We have never, that I'm aware of, actually taken it to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| But I believe we have the authority to do that, to litigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Most of our cases are conciliated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| So if there is an issue that's there, either the landlord or the homeowner association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2721)|
| 0:45:29| or whatever takes steps to conciliate the problem with the complainant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2729)|
| 0:45:36| So that's most of our cases are conciliated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| I wanted to ask you about on the homeless plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| is there any type of special consideration or so forth with the homeless veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Are you all in contact with the outpatient, VA outpatient clinic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| Or do you have a dialogue with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Or is there any special thing with the veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| I'm going to let Mike Dunthorne speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| He's the sole member of the Office of Tenure Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| We are working with the Veterans Administration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has signed on in the past year to their own plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| to end veteran homelessness in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| And they're really trying to ramp up their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| And so I have been working with the Veterans Administration representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| They have, for instance, a voucher program where an individual can get a housing voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| that's coupled with case management services provided by the VA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| And so they're implementing that program in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Before you leave, Michael, you're almost going to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Just finish that thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| This is in addition to normal Section 8 housing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| It's called the HUD-VASH program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| And as I say, I think in the past year they had 35 vouchers in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| I think they also had 35 in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Thirty-five targeted at four veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Four veterans, specifically four veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I know Section 8's got 3,585 vouchers, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| But the extra thing about this is each one of those vouchers comes with case management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| So the veteran who has been homeless gets an opportunity to find some housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| and also has somebody working with them to help them keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| And my other question was for Becky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I neglected to ask you on the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| When that federal funding drops off, does that simply limit the amount of work you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| or can accomplish through contractors, or do you shrink your staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| How does that affect your organization in-house as opposed to people who are doing home or CDGV or other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| What we have done this year, we've decreased our subrecipients so much per subrecipient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| We've had to cut back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| We've had to cut out completely some projects that we wanted to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2897)|
| 0:48:22| We wanted to fund My Front Yard again because it's very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| We would like to put some money in the Blighted Properties Redevelopment Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| which is like a construction loan program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| That was also an easy project that is still going on because we're getting program income back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| Fix them up and then they get sold to someone who resides there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Very successful project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| And we would like to supplement that with some federal CDBG funds, but we just didn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| So it limits the number of services we can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| It limits the number of properties we can affect, whether it's housing or blighted properties or vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| We have not had to cut staff at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| However, once our intern goes this year, we can't hire one next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| We're going to be fortunate to have a free intern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| But, you know, what we're focused on right now is our owner-occupied rehab| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| because that is the majority of what our staff does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| And so in order to make sure that their time is maximized and well spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| and that we are working on everything we can do, we have kind of maximized that project as much as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| Is there any way that you can pick up some of the slack by coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| and providing technical assistance to the homeowners so they can get it done themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| but maybe they don't know where to turn or how to do it and you can give them some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| Well, that's how we they contract with the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| We provide the work write-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| We help them choose a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| The actual contract for the work is between the homeowner and the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| We oversee the job, make sure it's done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| I didn't know if there was an alternative for you to just provide technical assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| without having the ability to do any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Well, we're writing the loans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| We're, you know, we're loaning them the money, and right now we're servicing the loans as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| And you see a budget forecast that looks like it's going to be a shrinking one going forward, not expanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| I wanted to ask you, you said you're a little slow with the light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Yes, first I wanted to make a comment about the improvements on High School Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| I've been able to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| I want to pull your microphone to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| I've got a head goal, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| I've been able to see the improvements on the before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| and it's impressive in regard to the follow-up on Councilperson Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| So I wanted to thank you for what you did in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| I've got a general question, if you could educate me some, about the area in Western Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| the area around the old rural high school, some of the KCDC housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3070)|
| 0:51:17| Are you involved in anything that's happening over there, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| We're not in a, you know, specific way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| I'm sure we have some housing rehab activity over there and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| but I know that they are removing some of the buildings of Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| And at this point, I don't really know what the plans are for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Is that mainly being done through KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| It is all being done through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Okay, that's what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Well, thank you and your staff for a very thorough presentation, and it's 5.51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| and if there's no other discussion, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I want to remind you all that Community Development Week is the week of April 25th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3120)|
| 0:52:12| and that's why we're having the ribbon cutting at the Lonsdale property that week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| to celebrate Community Development Week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| What happens at Community Development Week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| We're all thinking about all the wonderful things that community development does all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| We're having good thoughts, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110414?start=3151)|
