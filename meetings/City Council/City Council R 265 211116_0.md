| 0:15:39| It's suspended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=939)|

| 0:15:43| This would allow all those people signed up to speak, but as amended, only three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| Everyone understand what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=948)|

| 0:16:20| I'm speaking against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| In struggling to grasp the intricacies of the interlocal development agreements, we in the Sierra Club keep bumping our noses against obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| The most obvious is the fact that you're asking to vote on – you're asked to vote on agreements that are not totally complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| and that once you vote, you'll have effectively ceded your authority for any further changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| The case in point is that you're being asked to sign before having all the information about public and utility infrastructure agreements and associated costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1002)|
| 0:16:51| Then how can we ensure that those costs do not outweigh potential benefits to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Let's not sign the interlocal agreement before the details of the other agreements are reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| and the source of revenue identified for covering the cost of those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Don't sign an agreement without having a clear picture of the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| According to the published timeline, the development agreements, the lease and construction documents, should have been finalized by this past summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1028)|
| 0:17:16| Now, we fear that you're being pushed to make a hasty vote because some folks think it's getting late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| When the approval of bond issuance by the Sports Authority comes up later, neither the Commission nor this City Council will have any say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| Your effective control could end tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| And, of course, the Sierra Club is concerned that there are no provisions to ensure that the stadium and operations do not contribute to environmental degradation over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1052)|
| 0:17:42| The chair of our group's executive committee, a lawyer with an environmental background, says this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1062)|

| 0:17:54| The agreement misses a big opportunity to contribute to the City's sustainability goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| It does not restrict use of non-biodegradable plastic, nor does it require the composting of organic waste or any recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| The lessee should agree to, one, not allow the sale or use of plastic materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| two, provide for means to collect all waste products, including food waste, for composting or recycling, and separate the two kinds of waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| and, three, provide for delivery of those materials to appropriate composting or recycling facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| Mr. Boyd, as president of UT, leads an organization that has laudable sustainability goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| and a great program for composting food waste and recycling other waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| This is an important point. They already know how to eliminate styrofoam and plastic at UT games and provide clean drinking water for reliable bottles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1115)|
| 0:18:43| Why not mandate the same for the new park as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Just one example. We in the Sierra Club are not opposed to the stadium, but postponed this vote for a couple of weeks to get all this stuff right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| Thank you for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1134)|

| 0:19:09| Thank you. I'm Amy Nolan, representing the board of directors of the Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1149)|

| 0:19:25| We want to emphasize that really it's not only the stadium that we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1165)|
| 0:19:32| It's because of the commitment by Mr. Boyd as well to create that additional $100 million investment in new housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1172)|

| 0:19:53| Skilled trade shortages are across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1193)|

| 0:20:03| I think it's really exciting that the Urban League has taken on this task to bring more people into the pipeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1203)|
| 0:20:12| to provide them their training, and I would say that that will be a generational change in their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| and also will be a catalyst for economic prosperity because those folks won't be done when they build the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| I know there's contractors in the audience tonight that stand ready to hire those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| We actually announced today that we were taking a group to Morgan County Correctional Facility on Monday to look at their skilled trades program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1236)|

| 0:20:56| I feel like if the labor organizations could remove some of those barriers to get those people in the pipeline, they would have done so already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1256)|
| 0:21:06| The Urban League and their associated groups are really uniquely qualified to remove the kind of barriers to get these folks into skilled trades and meaningful employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1266)|
| 0:21:19| Finally, I would say that the stadium and associated development really provides a bridge for the prosperity that we've enjoyed in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1279)|
| 0:21:29| downtown north, south Knoxville, and there's, again, really been a barrier for that prosperity to cross over into east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1289)|
| 0:21:38| This is going to build that bridge to allow that prosperity to go into other parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| That's why we support, the chamber supports this project, and I hope you will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1306)|

| 0:22:36| My name is Barbara Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1356)|

| 0:22:43| I live about a mile from where I was born at St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| I have spent most of my life in Knoxville, all of my childhood and most of my adult life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| Both of my parents were educators in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| My mother taught in the city school system, and my father spent almost 30 years in the English department at the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1380)|
| 0:23:11| And if my parents were here, or if they are observing from beyond the grave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1391)|
| 0:23:19| I'm sure they would be very pleased by the fact that the University of Tennessee, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| has recently adopted a $15 an hour minimum wage for its employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1404)|
| 0:23:34| But I think they would have the same questions that I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Mr. Boyd presides over the University of Tennessee system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| and the system has decided that UTK employees need $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1424)|
| 0:23:53| Why then can we not agree that all workers in Knoxville, including the stadium workers, also need $15 an hour, at least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1433)|
| 0:24:04| That's really kind of a low minimum wage for this time in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| So this seems to be an inconsistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| The rationale apparently is that we can just leave wages up to the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| But leaving wages up to the market, which UTK is not now doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| is exactly how we have gotten into the current embarrassing situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| in which Tennessee has the highest percentage of minimum wage workers in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| We all know that the market needs a little push now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| And that's what labor is asking for in any workforce agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| With a project this size, in a city this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| letting the market totally dictate wages rates will only get us behinder on wages generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| and Tennessee can't get much behinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| We are asking the city council to postpone moving forward on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| until the Central Labor Council can sit down with Mr. Boyd and the other developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1510)|
| 0:25:17| to work out a workforce agreement acceptable to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1517)|

| 0:30:13| These are things that, right now, we don't have that in place either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| It says lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Now, is the lowest bid what you want for this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| Lowest bid isn't necessarily the one who pays the workers the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| because when you go by material, each one of us is going to pretty much pay the same price for material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| Where you cut in cost is production or labor costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| So I ask Randy, if this passes, can we have some kind of bidding process that benefits those who guarantee local hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| their safety procedures in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| At the same time, we're not going to disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I'm going to still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| I'm going to still be here asking, making sure things like this aren't happening that we're worried about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| things that he's guaranteeing are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| I don't know what else I can do as the ironworkers, but ask you guys for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| But if you guys don't, then I've got to look towards the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| And how do we guarantee that the workforce – remember, this isn't a union thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| This is about labor in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| How do we make sure that labor is taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Randy's saying he's going to guarantee that, but then we have to hold him accountable for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| How do we hold him accountable for it, other than having these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| making sure that we walk the job site, we see where people are coming from, we see where they're hired from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| I've asked a lot from you all, but this is your deciding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| So whatever way you vote, if this goes through, I ask that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| if you all do support labor like you do say you do, let's hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Let's find a process to make it accountable so we can get contractors to do – guarantee local hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| have a safety record, use the Department of Labor apprenticeships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| because that's going to provide a future for East Tennessee, for the kids in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| and provide a career for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| But the only way we can make that happen is we guarantee those contractors have a fair bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1932)|

| 0:32:43| I have an office at 1522 Bill Williams Avenue, another office at 800 Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| I am the president of the Knoxville Central Labor Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| and the general chairman of the Southern System Division of the Brotherhood of Maine-Savoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| In case you're not familiar with that union, it is a division of the Teamsters that represents railroad maintenance workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1981)|
| 0:33:09| I cover 13 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I have been elected and reelected for multiple years, 31 in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| I am retiring from that job December the 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| which will then give me plenty of time to devote to my job as president of the Knoxville Central Labor Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2004)|
| 0:33:35| I think we need a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| I think if we leave workers and those that need good-paying jobs out of this community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2019)|
| 0:33:50| and this opportunity to see that that's done, it will be a travesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| But I will have plenty of time to remind folks of what that travesty is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| I hope that this council would vote to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| would look at this as a great opportunity to see and establish something for the workers in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2053)|
| 0:34:25| We've heard lots about entrepreneurship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| but nobody wants to talk about what the worker who works for them is going to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| Are they going to make that $15 an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And, you know, when I look at $15 an hour, I'm almost ashamed to propose it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| because really that's not a living wage anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| I'm sorry, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| It just doesn't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| If you figure out how that works out for you, tell me $18 an hour is $36,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| if you work 2,080 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| So I think this is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I would hope you would postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Let us work out something with Boyd or Jim Development or whoever needs to sign on to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| and I would appreciate that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2117)|

| 0:35:30| You can start by stating your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2130)|
| 0:35:38| Hey, Kelly Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| I live at 115 Willow Avenue in Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2140)|

| 0:35:48| all neighbors, downtown residents, business owners, and workers that I've encountered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| have universally been in favor of and very excited about the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| It's clear from all the information I've read and studied over the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| there will be somewhere between economically very positive for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| and economically very, very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| Knoxville is a wonderful place to live, and this project will help ensure that we continue to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| Just as the property is being prepared, things have already started to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| I moved to Knoxville five years ago to work for a company called Altered State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| The headquarters were in a small business strip in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Four years ago they moved the headquarters to take over the old Ruby Tuesdays headquarters in Marable, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| I'm under the impression that their first choice was to stay in Knoxville, possibly downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2196)|
| 0:36:41| but Marable and Blount County were much more welcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| That's probably an important subject for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| But since moving to Marable, Altered State has had tremendous positive impact on that city and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| It's one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S., and first and foremost is a give-back company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| We're already starting to outgrow the headquarters that we've been in for only four years in Marable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| With that growth comes a need to find and hire the most talented people in the U.S. for different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| A project like this really helps to make Knoxville a more desirable place to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and helps all Tennessee companies attract talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| On a separate note, it's also clear that the people involved in this project have Knoxville's best interests in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| Mr. Boyd has an excellent track record for doing work and projects that benefit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| Last spring at work we were all asked to write a report on an inspirational black American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| and I decided to go local and coincidentally picked Steve Davis to study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| who happens to be involved in this project and is president of Jim Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| While I don't know him personally, I've researched enough to believe he's totally sincere when he says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| this is a transformational project for East Knoxville, the members of its business and residential communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| and specifically the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I personally would not be involved in this project if it were just another development opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| I'm doing it to give something back to my hometown and people with whom I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| On my own personal note, I would also not be at all supportive of a project that I didn't think was going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| residents of all socioeconomic levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| And I believe the people involved and you on the council have learned the lessons of past developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| that didn't live up to expectations and are committed to ensuring the project has broad community benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| Last side note, I grew up in Asheville, North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| Growing up downtown was desolate except for the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| And the renaissance that people are aware of in building up vibrant current Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| started in an area they branded as the South Slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2323)|

| 0:38:50| Mr. Walker, your time has concluded. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2330)|

| 0:39:24| So we're here tonight for an ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| The ask is that you postpone this so we can clarify the contractual agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| of exactly what we're getting ourselves into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| However, I want to come here and make clear the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| The demand is that you do not spend taxpayers' money on this project, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| Randy Boyd's land, Randy Boyd's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| I find it really disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Pastor New Sentinel shared a story, I think today or yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| saying that our firefighters are living on Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Now, as a taxpayer, I'm going to have to say I would much rather my tax dollars go to my first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| and EMTs with the way this gun violence has been in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| These are the people who are doing the first responding and saving some of these lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| So I don't understand how we have found ourselves $75 million deep into a stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| that is going to be used for someone's private interest, and we have firefighters on Section 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| That ain't straight. It ain't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| This is not other people's money, meaning a personal bank account that you make from entrepreneurship investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2436)|
| 0:40:46| This is taxpayers' money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| What are we doing for the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| How about a livable wage for everybody across the board who is a government employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| How about we are looking at other ways that we are going to build facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| that are still needed in our communities for youth enrichment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Where is our black business infrastructure and empowerment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| And more importantly, where is the black guaranteed contractual percentage involved in the development of the baseball stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| These are critical factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| You know, Commissioner Desha Lundy said this is going to be a game for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| And she's right. It absolutely is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| East Knoxville is going through gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Who has actually East Knoxville been prepared for, and more importantly, who is moving in East Knoxville right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2489)|
| 0:41:36| We need to change that terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| It would be excellent for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| It would be horrible for black Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| It would be horrible for poor Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| It would be horrible for homeless Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| So the ask is to postpone, but the demand is find another way to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| As far as I'm concerned, as a taxpayer and a voter, I do not approve nor authorize this transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| My time is you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2521)|

| 0:42:24| June Roston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| My address is 17522 Highway 95, Greenback, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| That's in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And I live on land that was part of the W.H. Griffiths family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| They were Quakers, and it was a stop on the Underground Railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| And that's one of the best things that white folks in East Tennessee, some of them that were Quakers, did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2563)|
| 0:42:50| So I'm proud to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| But I'm vice president of the Knoxville Oak Ridge Central Labor Council, and we are 15 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| But we represent thousands of people, union members who live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| First of all, I want people who are here tonight supporting postponing this to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2586)|
| 0:43:16| Would you stand, everybody who's in favor of postponing the vote on the interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| until we can get a written community benefits agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you, all of you, for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| We think this has to be in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| Carla Campbell, who was the attorney who was here during your work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| and who is the attorney who helped the Nashville group negotiate the community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2621)|
| 0:43:49| and she's on community TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Go and watch her, because she did a good explanation of how a community benefits agreement works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| A lot of the messaging that we have encountered kind of muddies the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| We know that it's to be with the developer. We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| We're not asking you to negotiate the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| We're asking R&R Land Company and Boyd Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| Carla told me that if there's not a written community, negotiated community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| there will be no way to document where the workers building that stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| or working at the stadium, where they come from, where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| So we won't know how many people from east Knoxville work building that stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| That's rather concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| It's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| So I urge you to vote to postpone until we can sit down at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| across from Boyd Sports and R&R Land Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| and get something for the working and poor people in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| and particularly east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Just a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| White Nissan Altima in the city county building deck parking is blocking traffic and needs to be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2719)|
| 0:45:25| If anyone knows the owner of the white Nissan Altima, tag number U0928W, please move your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2725)|
| 0:45:36| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Deirdre Harper, you're signed up next to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| and you'll have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| Deirdre Harper, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| I come before you with three points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| At the last baseball stadium workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| I was let down by the lack of impactful questions asked regarding a project of this magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| I'm no investor, but I'm aware there are three basic things you should look into before investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| One, past performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Research has proven commitments to baseball stadiums do not have a return on investment as promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| Two, risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| We are handing over control to build a stadium with taxpayers' dollars with no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| Number three, diversification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| This baseball stadium is an opportunity for the city of Knoxville to diversify its investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| and put the community as top priority with a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| Knoxville, Tennessee, is dealing with a poverty rate and gun violence that is astronomical compared to cities of this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| and we are still trying to recover from urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| This investment is a foul ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| With that being said, it alarms me to hear verbiage such as game-changing, let's play ball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| this is a home run when referring to the baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| when in fact we know people have advocated for two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| no taxpayer dollars used to pay for the baseball stadium and a community benefits agreement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| Yet here we are, not getting either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| That's not game-changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| I heard many times at a prior joint workshop, let's not miss out on yet another opportunity for investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| I can agree with that, but to me, not missing out is also getting it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| What's game-changing is on first base you have research supporting how an investment of this nature is good for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2846)|
| 0:47:33| second base is a bare minimum of listening to marginalized communities and agreeing to a community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| third base is not allowing public tax dollars to be used to fund the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2859)|
| 0:47:44| and stepping up to the plate is the city council asking for a postponement of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| Now that's a grand slam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| In closing, I'm aggravated when I watch how council, the mayor, and her deputies respond to Councilwoman Amelia Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2871)|
| 0:47:59| I sit back and watch you all cut her off when oftentimes her counterparts would stand at the same podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| over-talk Mayor Kincannon, go over the time frame a lot, or simply not adhere to the rules and nothing is said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| She is often not acknowledged as bringing good questions or conversations to the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| when in fact her knowledge and actions go above and beyond what is expected of a council representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=2898)|

| 0:51:51| These older people that have moved to Kodak and Sevierville and Gatlinburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| maybe an older person just needs something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3116)|

| 0:52:38| so why not do a new stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| If they're going to allow gambling, then heck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| who would like to go gamble and watch the team maybe from an area overseeing the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| since they may not allow it in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| There's a lot of working parts of this, and there's a whole lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3169)|

| 0:53:10| But, you know, the ticket prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| So you're going to lose the possibility of an inexpensive price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3193)|

| 0:53:43| and I would like to see maybe Mr. Boyd, instead of asking for money from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3223)|
| 0:53:48| why don't we get sponsors to help build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| So you can get, you know, all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| So, you know, I opposed for a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3232)|

| 0:56:13| A couple other questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| So one of the reasons I think that you were selected to be a part of the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| is truly your experience in stadium deals and involved in the financing of many stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| So can you share a little bit about how this process compares with what you've experienced in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| And I'm really particularly interested in kind of the order, the timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| the agreements that have been required for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| In my 30-plus years of municipal finance in the banking world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| I was involved in hundreds, if not thousands, of municipal projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Included in that were at least 12 sports-related facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Most noteworthy were the Oriole Park at Camden Yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| and M&T Bank Stadium where the Baltimore Ravens played.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Additionally, we did minor league stadiums in Harrisburg, Buffalo, outside of Philadelphia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| Ripken Stadium in Aberdeen, Maryland, and a few others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| All of these projects take time to be put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| It takes months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Every document builds on another document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| There are still other parties to come into play in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| We're going to have underwriters, financial advisors, bond attorneys, rating agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3448)|
| 0:57:33| and the ultimate investor in the project, the person or the entity that's going to write the $75 million check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| I know the city is behind this, and it's a distinction without a difference perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| but somebody is going to step to the table with $75 million on day one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| and they're going to have comments and things that they're going to want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| All this process, every step builds on the step in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| The lawyers can tell you much better than I can how this is going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| how the documents will be built, but it's very normal for this process to take months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| And all through the process, there will be constant negotiations in putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Have you ever been involved in a project where a private developer has invested this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| this much time, this much effort into a deal to contribute something of this magnitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3502)|
| 0:58:30| I cannot recall any project that was put together like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| that the developer has as much skin in the game, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| and has put as much into the project as Mr. Boyd has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3522)|

| 0:58:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| I want to thank everybody for your comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I'm going to bounce around a little bit between kind of broader questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| and some real technical ones since we're in the time to be in the weeds on this contract, on this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| So the first thing I wanted to raise is we talked a lot of comments about workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3540)|
| 0:59:06| So this is about jobs in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| So currently the Urban League has been contracted, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| to lead the workforce development efforts for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| So I'd like to have somebody from the Urban League or associated with that agreement to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| and please explain what the workforce development plan is, what's been done, what will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3566)|
| 0:59:35| So who's going to draw the lucky straw now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3575)|
| 0:59:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I'm Doug Kirchhofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3585)|

| 0:59:53| I can address that from the standpoint of what the expectations are on behalf of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| on the part of Boyd Sports and our land in terms of our arrangements and undertaking with the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| Their activities really fall into three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| First is contractor engagement, the contractor engagement component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And the objective there is to make an intentional effort to include minority businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| and people of color in all phases of the construction of the new baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| and make opportunities available for minority business owners to operate small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| when the new stadium is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Second activity area is the business development component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| and the objective there is to provide capacity building training to prepare minority business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| to operate small businesses when the new stadium is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| This training will increase the skills, knowledge, tools, equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and other resources needed to perform at a greater capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Finally, workforce and employment component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| The objective there is to implement workforce development initiatives that educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and train individuals to meet the current and future needs of the stadium project and related businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| They'll recruit workers, train workers for specific jobs available during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| and after construction of the stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| All of these services are intended to help us to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| and exceed a 15% DBE goal for involvement in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3675)|
| 1:01:20| Additionally, there are active plans and activities going on that revolve around apprenticeship programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3680)|
| 1:01:31| The Urban League and the disadvantaged business enterprise team has met with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| the State of Tennessee Department of Labor Apprentice Program Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| the Local Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Board, and its Area Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Pellissippi State Community College, and the Tennessee College of Applied Technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| as well as trade skills trainers to determine options and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| The goal is to train pre-apprentices in the short term that can do construction work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| as well as intermediate two-year craftsman certified construction workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| and long-term journeyman apprentice level tradesmen in skilled construction programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| The Department of Labor is assisting the Urban League right now to become an approved sponsor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| for the proposed workforce training, and the Workforce Board will pay for 25 training slots in years one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| Construction training will be certified by the National Center of Construction Education and Research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| whose industry-recognized credentials are portable and accepted through the construction industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3744)|
| 1:02:29| I would share with you that the Urban League is already actively involved in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| For example, they've held two sessions that have been designed to provide information to workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3756)|
| 1:02:45| and contractors in the East Knoxville community primarily to prepare them for when bidding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3765)|
| 1:02:52| They've had numerous training sessions for various aspects of the bidding process, of bonding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| and the various things that small contractors sometimes struggle with in being able to bid on projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| Another activity that's going on is sort of a matchmaking event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| where smaller contractors were introduced and had an opportunity to interact with larger contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| On a project like this, there are various tiers of contractors and subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| and sometimes partnering is the best opportunity, sometimes the only opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| for a smaller contractor to become involved, and so we want to create those types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| We expect the Urban League's activities to create those types of opportunities for partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you. One follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| The Urban League is contracted to do this workforce development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Yes, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| So there's an agreement in place between them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| There is an agreement that is being finalized. There's an agreement that has been agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| Okay. Will that document be shared publicly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| Okay. So just to repeat, you're committing to an agreement with the Knoxville Area Urban League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| to focus on workforce development, as you've outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| And that document will be made public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Okay. Thank you. I have more questions that are more detailed than that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| The next question I have is for Deputy Welch or Mr. Mametov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| A little bit in the weeds here, but the bond interest that we will earn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| can you talk about where those earnings can be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| What bills do we pay first for interest earned from our bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| Mr. Mametov?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| Yes. My name is Mark Mametov, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| Councilman Smith, I assume you're talking about once you issue bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| it will be $65 million roughly placed in a fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Typically it would be called a project fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| The indenture under which the bonds will issue will govern what interest earnings are used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| They could be used for several things, and certainly with input from the Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| and if any of you all have input, it would be more than welcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| given current interest rate environment, the interest earnings won't be significantly large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| but typically they're either retained or moved to the debt service fund to be credited toward interest payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3916)|
| 1:05:24| and therefore would reduce any obligation of the City-County to have to fund any debt service at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| At your election, they could also be moved as part of the seed money, as we've called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3930)|
| 1:05:38| to the Capital Improvement Reserve Fund, and theoretically, if you all should so choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| it could be used to fund any additional cost relative to the stadium that you all should so choose to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3943)|
| 1:05:53| But the most likely thing, the most typical thing, would be to just use those interest earnings for debt service payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Now you mentioned as we choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| I think you mean the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| Yes. I mean, the Sports Authority is the party to the indenture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| The Sports Authority would be the thing, but they're going to be having, those documents will be drafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3967)|
| 1:06:14| will be public documents, and certainly all parties, including City Council, County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| as well as the Sports Authority are welcome to weigh in on the terms of those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Another related question is, the Sports Authority will, so let me back up a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| So some of the questions I've had are about the phases of this project, this agreement, what stage we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3989)|
| 1:06:36| how it impacts subsequent stages, et cetera, how financial liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| what financial liability we have at different phases throughout that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| So essentially if we approve this resolution, the Sports Authority will have the authority to issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4005)|
| 1:06:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| They will have the authority to issue bonds, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| However, it would not be feasible for the Sports Authority to issue bonds without revenue sources to cover the payments on those bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| So the subsequent agreements will put those pieces into place and culminate in the ability of the Sports Authority to issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4025)|
| 1:07:15| So those of us, those folks who haven't been in the weeds for about a year on this, explain why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Why would that not be possible until all of those other agreements are in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| So over the past eight to ten months, we've laid out a financing plan for the stadium that has remained consistent over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4045)|
| 1:07:36| And at the end of the day, and I'm sure Mr. Mamentoff can speak to this with much more authority than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| but a financial institution is not going to just take a letter saying we have a plan for financing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| They're going to require documentation to prove that there are revenue sources to cover the type of financing that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| Okay. All right. Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| I have one more question, then I'll pause and let some of my colleagues ask some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| I have a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| There's been a lot of discussion tonight about community benefits agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| Can you explain what that is from a legal perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| Explain what a community agreement is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Community benefits agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| As I understand the community benefits agreement, it's an agreement between private parties, not a government entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| and it provides for one private party to agree who is developing a project, who is working on a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4110)|
| 1:08:39| agrees with another private party that they will provide certain benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| certain conditions with regard to that development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| and the other party to the agreement is really nothing more than an enforcing party to that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| and it would not be enforced by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| So it's an agreement between private parties to live up to certain promises relative to a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4141)|
| 1:09:10| but it doesn't involve, it wouldn't involve the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| It would not involve the courts authority because there are legal requirements to prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| So I know a lot of folks that have been through this before know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| but for those maybe that aren't familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| city council can't participate in a community benefits agreement with this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| Certainly not a community benefits agreement that would provide for the benefits that have been discussed in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4171)|
| 1:09:39| Things like local employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| Things like labor organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| Things like wage requirements and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| The state law prohibits us from entering into those agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Other organizations can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| This body cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| I'm not going to speak for other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| I'm going to speak for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| I have some more questions, but I'm going to pause for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Council Member Singh and then Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| If you want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| You can call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| I'll go next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| So I want discussion to happen, and then I want to, out of respect for what so many people have asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4214)|
| 1:10:21| request a postponement, make a motion for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| But at this point, I guess I'd like to ask Doug Kirchhofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| I'm sorry if I've mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| Is there an agreement with the Urban League on how much to pay the people that they train to work for in the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I didn't understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Is there an agreement on how – is there any – has there been conversation about how much the people that the Urban League trains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4249)|
| 1:10:58| right, to work for the stadium, how much they will be making, how much will they be earning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| No, there has not been any specific wage rates or levels discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| To me, that's been the important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| When we say market rate, the market hasn't been – there are too many Knox civilians that are getting paid market rate and not making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4274)|
| 1:11:23| So at no point have I tried to take away anything from what is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| There's so many good things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| I just want to add more to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| And that's the only piece that I think is really, really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4293)|
| 1:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| And that's – I guess I need to make the motion for postponement after more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Deputy Mayor Welch, I've got some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I'm going to try to break things up to make sure everyone has a chance to have some conversation tonight like my colleagues have done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| So if you think way back to when we started this process in the first workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| the first question that I asked you was whether authorizing this project itself would result in the need for a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4330)|
| 1:12:20| Can you answer that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| I sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| So first of all, state law prohibits the use of ad valerum property taxes to pay for stadiums and stadium debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4345)|
| 1:12:35| And then – so the answer to your question is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I guess I'll start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| That's always the best start with the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| So the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| The more nuance to that, it's prohibited by state law to pay for stadiums using that property tax ad valerum property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4364)|
| 1:12:55| You know, we've crafted a financing plan to limit risk to the city and to limit the annual obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4375)|
| 1:13:04| So when we look at all of our estimates in comparison with other expenses, this is relatively insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4384)|
| 1:13:14| Not insignificant in itself, but relatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| And I'm glad that you mentioned limited risk because that's exactly where I was going next with the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4399)|
| 1:13:28| What I've heard a lot from folks in the community is this notion of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| not wanting to make sure that the taxpayers aren't potentially on the hook for cost overruns for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| And so we've got a specific model that, as I understand it, is being used here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| which puts the developer at risk for construction cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| So I want to just confirm with you that that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Yes, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| That is Mr. Boyd has agreed to be a developer, not just at risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| but he has agreed to take on any cost overruns related to this project, assuming we get to that point after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4443)|
| 1:14:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And in order for us to protect the taxpayers from potential for cost overruns in construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4454)|
| 1:14:23| the developer has greater responsibility with regard to the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| So to protect the taxpayers from these cost overruns that could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| council has to, council's not in a position where it can make requirements for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| specific items in the development agreement like pay or hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| We just talked about the legality of those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| The bidding process, all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Those are not things that we can entertain because we're making sure the taxpayers are not at risk for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| So in essence, what I see is we have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| We can either get really involved in what's going on in the development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| in the development process, specifically on those things that we can legally address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| or we can make sure the taxpayers aren't at risk for any overruns for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| That's a good way of looking at it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Well, and certainly what I've heard from folks out there is that they really want to make sure we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| the taxpayers are not going to be responsible for any cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| So I would agree with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| So is it the administration's position, and are you able to commit to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4534)|
| 1:15:41| that you will make sure that in the development agreement that this developer at risk model is implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| and that that language is in there and enforceable so that we're not going to have anyone ever come back to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| and ask for more money for construction overruns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| That is correct, and I will look to the lawyers who are serving both on the Sports Authority Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| and as part of the negotiation, and I think we all hear that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| and have heard it from the beginning, and we'll make sure that that's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| I just wanted to make it really clear, because we know we've got lawyers here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| we've got members from, obviously the public's paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| this is a very high-priority or high-visibility project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| We've got members of the Sports Authority here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| and I just want to make it really clear that do not come back and ask for more money for cost overruns for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| I hear you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| I'm going to get back to, I'll let my other colleagues have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| and then I'll come back to some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I think many in the room may be aware that I spent a lot of time with these documents over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4609)|
| 1:16:58| and have submitted my questions and concerns that I would like to have addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| Before the meeting, I received an email from Ms. Welch with some responses to some of my questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4626)|
| 1:17:18| but only pertaining to the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| It's concerning to me to hear promises that we will be able to influence those agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4643)|
| 1:17:31| when we are asked to sign this interlocal agreement before we even get answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| questions we may have about the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| It's honestly the concern I have for this entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4665)|
| 1:17:51| There was a phrase that I had in mind coming here tonight, but it's gone out of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4671)|
| 1:17:59| I don't want this city to be a hostage to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| Tonight, it feels like we are entering into a relationship where we are essentially a hostage to commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4685)|
| 1:18:17| that we aren't even aware of that could come down the road because we haven't thoroughly discussed these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4697)|
| 1:18:27| Just for example, when I hear a conversation about cost overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| well, there is a measure, I believe in the development agreement, that allows for amendments to the stadium budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4713)|
| 1:18:45| which would come back to city council, but that would be a request to increase the construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4725)|
| 1:18:53| I don't think we're able at this point to say, hey, don't come back to us for increases to construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4733)|
| 1:19:02| because we're signing an interlocal agreement where there is a development agreement in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| that says new appropriations will come back to city council if it's not included in the stadium budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| and if those appropriations aren't approved, that's an opportunity for the developer to end the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4756)|
| 1:19:28| Talking about that hostage situation, if there are improvements needed to the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4768)|
| 1:19:36| required by Major League Baseball, and we are not in agreement that our dollars should be used towards those improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4776)|
| 1:19:45| the agreement ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| There are so many steps along the way where even though we say, don't come back to us, this is all the money you get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| there are multiple opportunities written throughout the agreement that allow amendments to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4794)|
| 1:20:03| I have questions about why, if the developer has agreed to cover cost overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| why would there be a need for budget amendments outside of change orders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| I want to get into the weeds, is essentially what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| Those are just a few of the questions that I have of my 19-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I support what Councilwoman Singh has proposed in terms of postponing this item so that we can have more discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4830)|
| 1:20:42| and do our due diligence as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| It's also concerning to me that tonight, when asked about the commitment and the contract with the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4846)|
| 1:20:59| that we heard from Boyd Sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| I don't think that as a body that we can look to the Urban League to provide oversight on this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4863)|
| 1:21:11| and to ensure that the goals are met, that the work conditions will be what we need them to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4871)|
| 1:21:20| when Boyd Sports is being allowed to speak on behalf of the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| That concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| If we continue discussion tonight, I have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I do believe we need space and time to really have a full understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| Again, I do think there's a lot of excitement for the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| There would probably be a lot more if it were not publicly funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| I know I would be super excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Again, I do think there's excitement for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| But I really do resent the fact that these documents have been presented to us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4917)|
| 1:22:05| and we've been told if we don't approve them, then the message to the developer is that this project ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4925)|
| 1:22:15| I really think that's unfortunate because we've just received the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| We've just received the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| And so we really need time to be able to do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| And I honestly have no doubt that this project will have the votes to support it to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4946)|
| 1:22:33| So I hope my colleagues will join Councilwoman Singh's call for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| I just want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I, too, would like to understand why the Urban League isn't speaking tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| Anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Phyllis Nichols had planned to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| She's ill this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| She's not well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| I want to address something related to the hourly wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| I think union jobs are the best jobs I think there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| I think there's room for a lot of folks to get a lot of work, to get a lot of opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| and most of it, as I understand it so far, is centered around East Knoxville by the people who live nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| So I had an opportunity to speak with about, I don't know, 200 or 300 of them over the past nine months, knocking doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5003)|
| 1:23:30| And the two or three things that I heard most often were, make sure that we get access to jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| and make sure that those jobs don't just end when the stadium's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| And they wanted to make sure that we hold the developer accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| and mostly that there be investments outside of the stadium in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| So I just want to tell you I had a 200 or 300-person focus group, and those are the things that I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| I want to go back to the hourly wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| You know, state law won't allow us to dictate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| However, we don't pay city workers $15 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| And so I have a hard time, whether it be this developer, any developer, saying do as I say, not as I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| We just approved $70 million for a public safety facility that's going to get split up into all kinds of contract work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| and we didn't say anything about an hourly wage then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| So I have been and will continue and officially advocating for us to utilize the compensation study that we have initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5070)|
| 1:24:41| this body, firefighters included, to make sure all city workers get a living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5081)|
| 1:24:49| So I expect everybody that wants to talk about a living wage tonight be prepared to advocate for a certain living wage for all city employees who don't get it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5089)|
| 1:25:03| So that aside, I want to be sure we talk about that wage because I think it's really important that this project's not going to solve everything in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5103)|
| 1:25:13| It's not going to solve anything in a certain part of town, but it is going to have a tremendous impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| But we can't put everything we desire on the world on a certain developer and not others if we're not putting what we desire for the world on ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5117)|
| 1:25:27| And so I have trouble for this developer or any other saying you've got to do this, but we're going to sit over here and do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| So here, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| And I think we should do that, and I think that we have got a compensation study that has initiated some work that will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5138)|
| 1:25:45| I just want to say that I don't disagree with any of the questions or comments or advocacy for a certain living wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| Everybody deserves a living wage in a livable city, and I think it begins with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| So I have some more comments, but that particular item I think is important to draw and connect close to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5157)|
| 1:26:06| Thank you, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Just in response, I'm grateful that I proposed and Council funded the compensation study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| We look forward to getting the results of that in the near future and rolling the recommendations into the next budget proposal, including hopefully bringing everybody up to $15 an hour or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5172)|
| 1:26:23| Now, next person signed up to speak is Councilmember Leiter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| Not signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Turn my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I don't remember signing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| A couple of different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I'm going to start with one that got brought up a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Ms. Welch, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| In the development agreement, 6.5 is the cost overruns that was brought up that starts with developers shall be responsible for any cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5206)|
| 1:27:01| And then 6.9 talks about change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| The parties can acknowledge and agree that the project plans may need to be supplemented, reordered, or revised from time to time during construction through the use of change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5226)|
| 1:27:16| Either developer or authority may request a construction change order by notifying the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Accordingly, the parties agree to cooperate with respect to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| I kind of skipped ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| But to all proposed modifications, each change order requested by the developer, which increases stadium costs by an amount which exceeds the stadium budget and will not be paid from contingency funds reserved in the stadium budget or by additional amounts paid by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5246)|
| 1:27:42| So I guess let me sum it up to see if that's what Councilwoman Parker was touching on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| When does it come back to us that we would end up approving an overrun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| If it exceeds the approved amount of funding that you are authorizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| We can't go over the budget that has been authorized by council without coming back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| And trust me, I do not want to come back to council to ask for more money unless there's some crazy extenuating circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| So the current approved amount, which is in the interlocal, which is what we're to vote on tonight, is 65 million, right? Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5293)|
| 1:28:24| So when are cost overruns triggered? What's a cost overrun versus a change order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| I'm going to let Mr. Mamontoff answer this question. He drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| Because I think that's what Councilwoman Parker's question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| So $65 million is the amount of the bonds. Remember that we have $13.5 million from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| So that takes you to $78.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| The difference between that and the $74 million estimated construction costs is for capitalized interest during construction and bond issuance costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5331)|
| 1:28:59| So roughly $74.4 million would be put in a project fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| Mr. Boyd would contribute some additional funds, as has been described at the prior workshops, to bring that amount up to roughly $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| So the stadium budget is expected to be south of $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| Probably the contingency would likely be, say, in the $7 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| So it would be a $7 million, at this point, rough contingency so that you're going to have plans and specs, very detailed plans and specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5360)|
| 1:29:29| But when you're doing on-site construction, you might find a way to do something more cost-efficiently or need to address a site concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5369)|
| 1:29:38| Because they're responsible for any cost overruns, they're going to want to try to do it in the most cost-efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| If the change would result in any of the things described in Clause B of that paragraph, Section 6.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| then it would have to come back to the sports authority, which is a laundry list of various items that would require sports authority approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| Because you're counting on a certain quality of stadium that looks a certain way to complement that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| and they can't change any of those things without the sports authority's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| Section A is intended to allow them to make changes that would be paid out of the contingency as necessary during the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| But in no event could they go above the amount that's in the project fund that's created from bond proceeds and from the state grant and from the funds contributed by Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| A cost overrun would be any amount that would go beyond that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| So if, say, it ended up costing $84 million to build this stadium, the developer would be responsible for the $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5432)|
| 1:30:41| The difference between that and what would be in the bond fund, that would be a cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| Okay. So help me out here. Let me do this for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5446)|
| 1:30:51| If the scope of the project work is for plastic stadium seating with a certain type of arm and a certain type of padded seat, you follow me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5451)|
| 1:31:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Okay. That's the scope of the project. That's what we agreed. That's what fits in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And they decide, or supply chain, yada, yada, post-pandemic world, things are a little crazy and it costs more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5469)|
| 1:31:22| Then they have to come back to the sports authority and say, hey, it turns out the stadium seating costs more than we originally estimated. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5482)|
| 1:31:31| Because that was part of the agreed upon scope, is a certain type of chair and the only way to cut the cost to value engineer it is to change out and take the foam pad out of the seat or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5491)|
| 1:31:43| In that case, it would be changing the quality and they would have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| Or if they were changing it to put in a lower quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| To put in a lesser quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| Okay. But then let's say that RR development, did I get that correct? RR land development, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5514)|
| 1:32:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Okay. Decides that they want to do an even fancier, nicer padded seat. That's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| If they want to do something that's nicer and above the quality of what the agreed upon scope was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| Well, if it's within the contingency and there's a certain amount of latitude there, but it's not, I mean, I'm not sure I'm following your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5532)|
| 1:32:23| I guess can they decide to do something nicer and above the quality or the scope? I'm not saying that they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5543)|
| 1:32:34| I'm saying if they were to choose to do something that was above, at a higher quality, are they allowed to do that and it's not part of the contingency and it's not part of the thing, if they so choose to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5554)|
| 1:32:45| Yeah. I mean, if they so choose to pay for it, they certainly can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Because that was always my analogy. I'm sorry I can't find a classier analogy. But my analogy was if they decided to do gold-plated toilets, that's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| Because that's not the scope that we agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| We're not going to do anything quite that fancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| All right. Sorry. Garish example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Okay. All right. So that helps me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| So with spiraling costs of construction costs, there is a possibility of something coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| But the contract has a lot of, the development agreement has a lot of things in here about value engineering to get within cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5594)|
| 1:33:22| Okay. Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| I have another question while I'm talking about the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| I believe Mr. Eade might be the right person to answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| I have a question about, I'll speak slowly and give you time to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| The design of the project, what are sustainability, are there sustainability goals and design elements of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5621)|
| 1:33:53| You know, what are we, I'm familiar with lead construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Are there elements of that in this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I've had someone ask me about, like, lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| We have sustainability and climate goals for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Ferris Eade with Design Innovation Architects, part of the GEMMA design team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| Sustainable items incorporated into the ballpark, into the stadium design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| An example is, you know, I talked about lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| Of course, lead provides us a checklist from the Green Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| And we, our goal is to incorporate as many as possible within the allocated budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| An example, looked at different mechanical systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| A more efficient system is a water source heat pump system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Slightly higher cost, but long term, a lot less energy usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Food service equipment can connect into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| So long term for the city, better environmental system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| The overall design of the stadium, the fact that it does not have a big parking lot around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| You don't have this big sea of asphalt in the heat sink, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| So that is a sustainable design feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| Discussions with CAT regarding having efficient transportation systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| Accessibility via wide sidewalks and connectivity to the potential greenway in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| Those are all sustainable features beyond what we would normally do as in high efficiency LED lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| The overall stadium lighting is basically, you no longer have these monster giant LED, basically, mercury type lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| It's a very efficient LED system that just overall, you know, not just from an efficiency standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| but also from an environmental standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| It basically cuts down on light to lead to the residential neighborhoods and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| So there are many systems involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Including groundwater filtration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Underneath the ballpark itself, all the water that drains on the ballpark is filtered before it enters into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| Same in the large plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| There's basically permeable pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| And so having a monster detention pond and wasting land, we treat water filtration in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| So there are several features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| So we're not building it to LEED standards, but we're incorporating some of the items from the checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5764)|
| 1:36:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| At the end of the day, like most LEED projects, is we're going to incorporate as many as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| And whether it's a LEED certified or not, that's a choice that many people can make afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| I'll let my colleagues ask questions for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| Just a very quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| I don't know if this is for Director Welch or Mr. Mamatov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| But in the event there was a cost amount that came back to council, regardless of the amount of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| would that amount then be split between the city and the county since this is a joint venture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5804)|
| 1:36:54| We would have to bring it back to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| We wouldn't bring something just back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| It would have to go back to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| And that cost would be split between the two bodies, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| In the event that that were to happen, it would be split between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| But, of course, it would have to go to both bodies for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I think Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Last week I had the opportunity to meet with the members of the Knoxville Building and Construction Trades Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| and their concerns for workers, and I share those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| So I had some questions for Mr. Boyd or somebody from the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| Mr. Boyd, I don't know if you want to come up and answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5859)|
| 1:37:47| Randy Boyd, president or owner of Boyd Sports and RR Land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| Well, I think one of the questions that first came up was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| obviously you heard the conversation earlier about the responsibility that the developer has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| given the contractor at risk model or the developer at risk model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| But one question I have for you is, will this be a fair and competitive process for any contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5885)|
| 1:38:13| building on jobs for the multi-use stadium, whether they're union or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| I think just as practical business people, we're going to make sure that it's a competitive bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| So any contractor, union or otherwise, that is properly vetted and pre-qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| will be fairly considered in the bidding process and invited to make a bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| Will the general contractor give consideration in the selection of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| for those with good worker safety records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| It will be the highest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| And will the general contractor give consideration in the selection of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| for those who commit to using local workers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| It's the highest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| And with regard to local workers, are you talking about local workers in East Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| Are you talking about something more specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| We've been very hyper-local in our focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| We've got one of our partners in the development that's headquartered on Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| one other developer that's headquartered in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| We've been working with Urban League, it's been talked about exhaustively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| that's recruiting in the East Oxford area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| So our version of local is East Oxford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| And will the general contractor give consideration in the selection of contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| for those with certified apprenticeship programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| Yes, and any type of training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| We want to make sure, and we've talked about this from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| I think sometimes we spend a lot of time making sure that we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| 15% of the people that we contract with are led by, it's a minority business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| but even more importantly, the people that work for that minority business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| We want to make sure that the people in that community are getting the training they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| These jobs will be temporary in the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| They'll be there for six months, a year, maybe two years at the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| But to make an impact that's lasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| we've got to give people the skills that will allow them to go for the next job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| and the next job and for the rest of their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| And that's what we're determined to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Thank you, Mr. Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| I'm going to let my colleagues ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Yes, a very brief question for Mr. Boyd, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| Mr. Boyd, I understand that you've had some meetings with the local unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| And by the reports I have, those meetings have been beneficial and cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| I think beneficial and cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| The one meeting that I had with the representatives from the labor union| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6035)|
| 1:40:40| was the recognition that there are severe training needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6040)|

| 1:40:54| so that those people can have the same training opportunities that other people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6054)|

| 1:41:04| I was involved in one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6064)|

| 1:41:34| I was just going to reiterate a couple of things that I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| or said at the workshop last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| You know, we have an individual who has spent $5.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| within one to two miles of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| $650,000 to Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| almost $1.7 million to Emerald Youth Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| $1 million to Supporting Center City Programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| to include education, youth, mental health, community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6124)|

| 1:42:10| $1 million to YWAC to add housing capacity for women of domestic violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6130)|
| 1:42:18| and not to mention, as we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| the partnership with Tuskegee Next, Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6141)|

| 1:42:36| We have $13.5 million from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| The county is splitting this 50-50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| and an investment of nearly $50 million by an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| that includes a 30-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| That is three to four times the median lease agreement in a venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| And at the end of the day, Mr. Boyd's not going to own any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| You know, I don't know where else that you can spend $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| on a $100 million project and get an ROI of nearly half a billion dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| You know, I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| if this isn't a reflection of a real commitment and love for a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| and its people and its future, I'm really not sure what else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| You know, how much more can we ask for an individual to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| And really at some point, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| my personal opinion is it appears we've become a bit greedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| And I just feel like in making this decision difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| I just feel like without question it's a legacy decision for our future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| for the well-being and prosperity for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| This investment includes an increased tax base of monumental proportions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| And, yeah, it is game-changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| especially for the social services that we all need, we desperately need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| But this also gives us the ability to afford to pay higher wages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6241)|
| 1:44:09| for our first responders and for our city workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| Public-private partnerships are gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| They're win-win for communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| And the rewards are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| They're long-lasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| And, again, the biggest risk is not taking this risk at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| And it truly would be crippling for our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| by depriving it of its economic growth, job opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| the chance to bridge our city and heal a divide that's existed for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| And there are too many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| not the least of which is Deputy to the Mayor Stephanie Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| have worked tirelessly to make something that truly is a community benefit to our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| and that will benefit our residents and for generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| So I, for one, want to extend a thank you to Mr. Boyd for all the effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| and everything that he has done to try and make this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| Again, I just say it's time to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Thank you, Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| And then Ryder, then Vice-Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| There's just something mentioned that I wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| From my reading of the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| where the competitive bidding process is only for contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| when using the capital improvement reserve fund for over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6337)|
| 1:45:46| Mr. Boyd, would you mind if I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6346)|
| 1:45:50| I'm concerned that our documents would not hold the developer accountable to anything outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6350)|
| 1:45:58| this competitive bid process that's described in the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| But do you have plans to have a competitive bidding process on contracts under $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6361)|
| 1:46:10| We are committed as a developer, as business people, to have competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| It seems quite rhetorical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| I mean, if you're a business, you're going to have competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Why would we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| We will definitely be having competitive bids on the private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| and any of the things that we do building the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| But definitely not held to that standard by our document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Would you object to the deliberation on those bids coming before the full sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6393)|
| 1:46:45| rather than needing only the approval of the authority representative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| You're saying you would like for me to bring every contract that we're doing with the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| to the city council to approve each contract in the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| No, bring it before the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| And it could be contracts above a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| For city council, it's above $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| I think there could be a reasonable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| But currently, none of that deliberation comes before the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| So maybe restate the question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| I have to make sure I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| You're saying that if we have any contract over $25,000 or a certain amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| we would bring it before the city council to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| Before the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| Before the sports authority to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| We think that would be unworkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| Could I ask Councilwoman Parker, which part of the development agreement are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| Which section, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| The private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Let me find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| I love Asian reference numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| It will take me a minute, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6467)|
| 1:47:54| Can I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| Mr. Mamentoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| I was just going to point, Councilwoman Parker, to Section 5.11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| which requires them to actually obtain bids from licensed subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| The construction manager is actually a relatively small part of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| They basically serve as a manager for getting contracts from subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| And in Section 5.11, it provides that they will obtain bids from appropriately licensed subcontractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| each component of the construction of the stadium province that will be undertaken by a subcontractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| I understand that roughly 90% of the cost of the project will be undertaken by subcontractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6503)|
| 1:48:31| Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| I couldn't follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| 7. what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| It's 5.11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| It's probably at the bottom of page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| It goes over the top of page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| And it then goes on to say the authority representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| And as you may know, the authority hired Lawlor Wood to be—I think this may have been a question you had, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6523)|
| 1:48:53| The authority representative actually can be multiple persons at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| It's referring to the chairman of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| But in many cases, such as this, it's intended to refer to their construction consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| someone who has expertise in ensuring that the process is transparent, that the bidding is done in an appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| So that's why the reference to authority representative there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| But, yes, it goes on to say that shall be entitled to receive full access to information related to such bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| the bids received, and such other information that they need to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| And I think there's something you commented on, too, is that they receive the lowest cost for the construction of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| Now, that cost would take into account the DBE requirements because that is an overarching requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6569)|
| 1:49:35| that the subcontractors would have DBE requirements built into their subcontracts as required by the DBE provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| So it would be a bidding procedure, but the bidding procedure would have a requirement that they meet the DBE requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6581)|
| 1:49:51| Ms. Welch, could you help us clarify this question, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Yes. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| I just wanted to make the point that the developer at risk or the cost overruns being the responsibility of the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| is why the contracts are framed this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| The responsibility for cost overruns is with the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| Therefore, the developer needs to have the ability to manage the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| and not move it into a political process, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6619)|
| 1:50:24| And I would like to restate for the record, because I have said before at multiple workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| but Boyd Sports, we are going to guarantee any cost overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| We will not come before you and ask you for any additional money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I will personally make sure that we cover any additional cost that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6645)|
| 1:50:46| Ms. Parker, or Ms. Ryder, has her line on, if you are at a pausing moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| Well, just to answer Ms. Ryder's question, the section that I was referring to is in the lease agreement, section 7.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6652)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6662)|
| 1:51:14| Just one other, actually, I'll hold off for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6674)|
| 1:51:19| Okay. Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| Should I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Okay. Well, Mr. Boyd, you can sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I can tell how much fun it is to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| I can see why you'd want to do it again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| Okay. Anyway. Sorry, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| I want to talk about what we're actually voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| So we're voting on the interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| And, Ms. Welch, in the packet that was published, I believe, according to the date on the top, November 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6705)|
| 1:51:53| which was the workshop packet, my apologies for not being able to attend the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| but I appreciate having over an hour of your time to ask additional questions outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| But there was a chart in that packet from November 5th, which I believe is published to the public, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6723)|
| 1:52:13| Yes, Mr. Johnson, it's published on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Which document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| This whole packet, I think, was part of the packet that went out for the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| So, Ms. Welch, there's a table starting on page 7 that talks about what we are voting on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| and what we would vote on in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| Yes. Okay. Making sure we're on the right page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| So tonight we're voting on the interlocal agreement, which my interpretation of that is kind of like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| we got a proposal for a marriage, and it's been going on for a while, and we've never said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6764)|
| 1:52:50| Does that seem pretty adequate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| We've been leaving our purported possible partner out there hanging for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| I like the analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| Upping the ante on the ring, maybe, and other terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| So once we decide we're going to go for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| and engage with the partnership of the county, the city, and the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6788)|
| 1:53:17| which we already formed earlier, which has to happen in that order so we can have the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| So tonight we're just voting on the interlocal agreement, which is at the top of the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| But we're also following down the things that have to happen for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| future votes for council are the management agreement on the plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| the pilot TIF authorization for private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| which when I met with you, you said would be around January 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| And then when I flip the page, we also vote on the Magnolia Avenue redevelopment plan TIF amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6828)|
| 1:53:56| and then we would at some point vote on the public improvements agreement, streetscapes and plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6836)|
| 1:54:02| Correct? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| Okay. So in between tonight's vote on an interlocal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| or what's presented tonight in the agenda to vote on and these other items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| one, two, three, four, five more times that you get to come and we get to vote on different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6855)|
| 1:54:21| or somebody is going to come down here. We're going to vote on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| If we move forward past tonight, the development agreement and the lease agreement happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| and those go to the sports authority. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6869)|
| 1:54:34| Okay. And we all have our draft copies of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| Are there changes anticipated to the draft copies of the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| the lease and the development agreement, the lease agreement and the development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| So the terms of the deal, the key terms that we've been talking about that have pretty much been consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| nearly through every workshop and community meeting, those terms are not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6897)|
| 1:55:04| Yes, well, there'll be other changes in the development agreement and the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| And you heard Mr. Bass speak about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| There are other parties that, at this point, we haven't engaged because we need to know there's a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| We haven't accepted the ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| We haven't accepted the ring yet. That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| So there are other parties that, as they begin to weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| there are aspects of the development agreement and the lease agreement that will need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| The sports authority, this is a public body that was appointed, obviously, jointly by county commission and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6934)|
| 1:55:43| And all of those documents will continue to be available, as will the changes that occur along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6943)|
| 1:55:51| But the key terms of the deal haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| So if we agree to move forward with an interlocal agreement and say we accept your proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| and we want to continue moving forward to do a development agreement, a lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| and the other five things that come to council for voting along the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| what's the timeframe for voting on the development agreement and the lease agreement with the sports authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| I'm sorry, signing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| That will all be happening within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6979)|
| 1:56:24| So we're looking at, you know, a January timeline to wrap up as much of this as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6984)|
| 1:56:30| And really, the development agreement and the lease agreement right now are at a 90% point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| If I had strong feelings about something in the development agreement or the lease agreement that I wanted to discuss and or push with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=6996)|
| 1:56:46| like, meet with Mr. Bass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Sorry, I may have gotten that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| Mr. Hill, Ms. Tillman on the sports authority, and or you guys, I could do that and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7010)|
| 1:56:58| I think it needs to identify some part of, like, what I called Mr. Eid on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| to identify that there's some sustainability factors being considered in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| I mean, those discussions with you, that could get modified, publicly viewed, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7031)|
| 1:57:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| The other thing I wanted to ask about real quick, and then I'll move along, is the, you guys have been, Mr. Kirchhoff and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7047)|
| 1:57:39| Boyd, you guys have been working with Knoxville Area Urban League for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| I know Ms. Nickel is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| I've had conversations with her and I've pulled back and forth emails and watched the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| They've already started some of the process for the workforce development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| So, there is an existing agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| There's a working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| The process has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| Along the process, and then I'll move along, I think, you know, there's some important history, and I'm newer to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7085)|
| 1:58:15| I moved here in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| So, the stadium, or the baseball team, left Knoxville prior to that, and one of the things that got shared with us from a former commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7098)|
| 1:58:27| earlier this year was the efforts made by commissioners to keep the baseball team from leaving in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7107)|
| 1:58:35| And that's the reason this conversation got started, is because people always had regrets that the team left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| And I've had people that were part of those conversations that were witnesses to it, former team owner conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| where former team owners stood there and said, no matter what you do, no matter how much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| no matter how much you spend on Bill Myers Stadium, we don't want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| We're leaving. We're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| And one of the things that got shared with council members, and I've shared with the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| and nobody's talked about it, is a letter from Councilman Danny Mayfield at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| And he wrote a letter to the Knox County Commission in 1998, which I'm happy to share with anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| Like I said, it came from a former commissioner, because he sent the letter to the commissioners at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| basically pledging that he wanted to do anything possible to keep the stadium and keep the ball team in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7163)|
| 1:59:32| It was something he was very committed to and he wanted for his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| He, of course, wanted it at the site that it was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| Unfortunately, the powers that be didn't believe in his community and wouldn't keep it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7180)|
| 1:59:48| no matter what amount of money was put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| And people didn't want to put the money forth to keep it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| Not only did the team not want to be there and the owners didn't want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| And so what I hear and what I've said from the beginning is that I wanted to hear what that community wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7199)|
| 2:00:05| And I've heard Bob Booker say some pretty impassioned things about growing up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7205)|
| 2:00:11| and seeing all the changes in his community and how great of an opportunity this is and how he wants it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7211)|
| 2:00:21| I'm supporting this and I want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| We've talked about this since 2019, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| We've had February budget meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| We've had April public budget meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| We've had workshop after workshop after workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| I may be coming forward and I've talked to Mr. Hill today and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7236)|
| 2:00:41| If I don't like something that you agree to in the development agreement or the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| you're going to see me again on the vote for these other five things that are coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| So you have to get it right or we can't vote on these things and we can't move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| But there are people in East Knoxville that we're not listening to and we're not heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| when they try to keep the team from leaving in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| I think this is our opportunity to make it right and make up for that when we let it slip away last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| I think we have an opportunity here where the East Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| and I don't want to step on Vice Mayor McKenzie's toes because that's her district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7279)|
| 2:01:23| but I have not heard from people in that community anything but we want it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7283)|
| 2:01:28| One of the stories that got shared for me, one of the questions has been, can people afford the tickets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7288)|
| 2:01:34| There was a story about somebody who was like, I have, I think it was four or five kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| I could never afford to take my kids out to Sevierville to go to the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| but now I will be able to because it's here in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| So I've only heard all these stories about how we didn't want it to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7306)|
| 2:01:50| they wouldn't stay with us, they didn't want us to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| and so that's what I see this as, is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| So I'm going to let my colleagues speak from there, but that's how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| Again, I'll share the letter from Councilman Mayfield if anyone wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7324)|
| 2:02:09| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| Vice Mayor, your light was on next, but you wanted me to go to your colleagues first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| Okay, Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| What's Councilmember Parker next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| I'm sorry, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| Councilmember Smith, I think you haven't had a chance to speak since Councilmember Parker has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7344)|
| 2:02:30| I'm sorry, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| Okay, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| I'm just concerned about a few things that I just heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| because of the timeline concerns that I've raised in my document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| One thing that's really important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| is that unlike the development agreement and the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| if we sign the interlocal agreement, there is no getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| It's a marriage till death do us part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| There is a provision in here that says we cannot get out of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7379)|
| 2:03:04| When we had our workshop, it was long ago, I think our first workshop on the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7384)|
| 2:03:11| my understanding was that we essentially were committed to this project once debt was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7391)|
| 2:03:21| But after reading the interlocal agreement, we're committed for the life of the project once we sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7401)|
| 2:03:27| There's no getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| The second thing I wanted to lift up is that the timeline is structured in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| that we have no leverage after today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7413)|
| 2:03:36| The timeline is set up in such a way that says if public infrastructure agreement is not reached by May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| the developer can terminate the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| So there's no game we can play here where we're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| you don't get my signature on the public infrastructure agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| if you don't make changes to the development and infrastructure agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| That doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| It also requires the sports authority to have cash in hand by the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7439)|
| 2:04:08| So by the end of February, cash will be in hand, contracts can be entered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| money can be spent, things can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7453)|
| 2:04:18| Meanwhile, we feel like we are still in a place to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| But that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| There are so many provisions put in here that protect the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| Once we sign this agreement, there's no turning back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| There's no influence that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| We are at the mercy of the sports authority to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| and get the development agreement and lease agreement that our city needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| I think that we are not doing our due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| if we don't ensure those things are in place before we give all of our power away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7487)|
| 2:04:57| Gosh, there's just so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| I feel uncomfortable, and I think I've said this before, but I just want to emphasize it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| I feel uncomfortable signing this agreement and guaranteeing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| without even seeing the stadium budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| to know if all of the promises that we're hearing are even reflected in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7515)|
| 2:05:23| We just heard about sustainability measures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| and it says as many sustainability measures as possible as allowed by the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| We should be having those conversations right now of what is that standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| what has been budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| and let's not have any expectations for this stadium after we sign this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7539)|
| 2:05:48| Now is the time to ensure that the plans in place and moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| are what we are promising to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| Right now, we're not able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| Right now, we are taking on way too much risk with this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7561)|
| 2:06:07| It's not just about the bond payment, but it's about the pledged revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7567)|
| 2:06:15| And whether the pledged revenues don't come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| we have to draw down on the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| We get a ding on our credit rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| That means the debt service payments increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| There are things that we have to take into account beyond the bond payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7589)|
| 2:06:37| other implications that could increase our liabilities throughout this 30-year agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7597)|
| 2:06:44| And this agreement may be beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| We may say, hey, let's tweak here and let's tweak here, but otherwise it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| But I don't feel like we've had the time to really sit with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| so that we are assured that the plans that move forward are what our community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7617)|
| 2:07:04| what our community is calling for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| and are worth the cost that this is going to have to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| because the benefit outweighs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| I believe we need more time to be sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| One question I have is there are seven votes before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| and I just want to make sure I'm clear whoever wants to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7649)|
| 2:07:32| We've already approved the development agreement, plan development zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7652)|
| 2:07:41| This is the second vote before this body, and there will be five more before we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7661)|
| 2:07:49| Yes, Council Member Smith, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Then you add on the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| So seven votes before this body, plenty more with the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| I've supported this project from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| and the reason is because I had three kind of checks in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7687)|
| 2:08:12| One is do the people who live around it want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| So we all get a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| But do the people who live within a mile really want it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| And so when I listen to folks, the answers that feed to that yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7702)|
| 2:08:29| or the inputs are is there a workforce development available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7709)|
| 2:08:34| Is this going to have a displacement effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| Are there DBE requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| I think, you know, do we have access to attend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| Does the public ever have access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| So with all of those considered, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| and given the fact that our portion of the development is less than 3% of the whole development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7733)|
| 2:09:01| the answer I heard from people that live nearby was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| So a lot of times we hear from folks who tell other folks in the community what they should want or need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7745)|
| 2:09:13| and, like, I agree with Councilwoman Ryder's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7753)|
| 2:09:16| I think it's really important that we listen to the folks who live really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7756)|
| 2:09:22| So beyond do people who live near it want it, can we afford it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7762)|
| 2:09:28| Is this something we can afford?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| And so the total bond issuance is $63 million, excuse me, $70-something million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| but that number gets subtracted from all the way down to our requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7777)|
| 2:09:43| and the city's budget every year is around $240,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| So can we afford $240,000 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| That's the cost of two decent sidewalks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| So I love sidewalks, but we can afford two more sidewalks a year for $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7797)|
| 2:10:04| This is hard math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| We've been paying attention for a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| A lot of folks are busy with life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| They don't know all these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| So I'm just going to work through a couple of these because it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| So $240,000 a year we're going to pay towards our debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7813)|
| 2:10:18| Thanks to input and listening by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| we don't want to do it with the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| With this, what we did with the Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| which is we didn't save for repairs or investments or improvements in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| So basically the only new information we presented with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| other than fine-tuned details and interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| is the new capital improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| So we split that with the county, and that equates to about $170,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| So think of it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| You have a mortgage, but you're going to set aside money for when the A.C. breaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7850)|
| 2:10:54| or the washer breaks, fill in the blank of all the appliances that are going to break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| So we're going to have $410,000 a year for debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| and building improvements so that the next generation doesn't have to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| the next city council members don't have to pay for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| the next mayors don't have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| So $410,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| We also have a $7 million contingency budget in the stadium development project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7877)|
| 2:11:23| So any dollars not spent on contingency dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| so things associated that are unpredictable as part of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| we get to use to pay down either the debt we owe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| or that savings account for repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| So we're at $410,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| That may go lower, but that's what we're tracking so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| As we've learned from Councilman Roberto, as a reference to cost overruns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| we just learned from the safety center how expensive that can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| And so part of the tradeoff in all of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| making sure we have a million-dollar lease every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| and that the developer in exchange gets to have some flexibility with our values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| which, by the way, 15% DBE is not even what the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7928)|
| 2:12:12| So our values stretched on top of that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7932)|
| 2:12:19| These numbers are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| This whole understanding is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7940)|
| 2:12:23| So the forecast for this project aims for new sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| to make an impact starting in year 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| So there's a chance we could pay even less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| but the 10-year mark, that has us at $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Our finance director may be able to guess at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| but there are a lot of items we approve that are more than $4 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| So for this type of impact, $4 million over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7964)|
| 2:12:50| So $410,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7970)|
| 2:12:52| Can the city afford that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| I think the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| Also, an important factor to remember is there are a lot of studies that say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| big stadium investments by cities where the cities do all of the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| or do the majority of the investment don't pay off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| But none of those, and I shouldn't say none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| most of those co-studies don't represent a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| that's only putting in 3% of the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| That's what our city is contributing towards, is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| And so I think that's really important, and I think we can afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| I'm almost finished, but I think this whole understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8007)|
| 2:13:30| of what we're considering is important for everybody to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| The third thing that I've been really thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| is what happens when baseball ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| The developer or any owner can't live forever, sports don't live forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8020)|
| 2:13:44| but what happens to make sure that we're not obligated beyond year 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| And so we will own a 7-acre property in the middle of the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8028)|
| 2:13:52| worth about $10 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| We can argue whether it's 8, 10, 12, 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| It'll be worth a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| And it'll be developed in a way that the community has access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| and in year 31, we can renegotiate that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| So I think what happens when baseball ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| and how do we make sure we're not holding the bag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| I think this administration has worked hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| to make sure we're not liable for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| And I just want to add one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| as it relates to community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| Again, the only community benefit in this state has been done in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| It's done where the city gifted land to a sports team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| We're paying 3% of this entire thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| and so we've got pretty good community impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| based on the people who live nearby the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8082)|
| 2:14:46| So here's the things I heard that they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| Investments in local youth, safe places for kids outside of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| making sure minority-owned businesses get contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8095)|
| 2:15:00| housing programs for the most marginalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8100)|
| 2:15:03| restoring cultural heritage to a place that was displaced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| and training, contracting, and hiring for local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| hundreds of jobs for people who live nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| All of those, and this is important because this has just kind of evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8115)|
| 2:15:19| all of those are either paid, all of those have already been committed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| checks written, or are part of or will be part of an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| So everybody that's asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| the folks who are asking for those benefits that I just rattled off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| have already been dispersed in the form of checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| or are some type of agreement that we hold a developer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| by the way, that we don't hold any developers to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| So the idea that this is just the same as everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8148)|
| 2:15:51| we don't do this for any contractor or any developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8151)|
| 2:15:57| So I would say that a million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| a councilwoman testament rattled off a few of those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| They equal more than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| This is going to cost more or less $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| My point is, sometimes when we get to talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8167)|
| 2:16:11| community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| the agreement somehow becomes more important than community benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| that actually impact people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| And the community benefits that are asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| already equate to our stake in the game already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| And so the agreement part is important for liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| and holding people accountable, but as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| those have already either been written through checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| or are part of agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8196)|
| 2:16:39| So I think some may say this is a single agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| I don't agree that this is a single agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| I think there are tons of community benefits that are in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| have been paid for, or will be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| And so I think when you think about the people who live nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| the affordability of the taxpayer to burden this in the near term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| until the sales tax revenues catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| and our ability to be string free or renegotiate a lease in 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8228)|
| 2:17:13| mixed with benefits that actually impact people's lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| as opposed to focusing on all the agreements on one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8238)|
| 2:17:22| I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8242)|
| 2:17:24| And I would add, the organizations that match those benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| Claude Walker Park, Green Magnet Academy, YWCA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| the Vet Culture Exchange Center, Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| imagine talking to folks who have been in that community for 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| and saying, actually, we don't think the benefits that you're going to help with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| or that you're going to receive are the ones that we should vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| There are these other benefits that we want to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| And so we would all disagree on the benefits we want to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| to the ones that have been rattled off tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| But that's a substantial contribution to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| and it has contracts associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8280)|
| 2:18:03| that will hold parties involved accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| So thanks for letting me get through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| but I think that whole picture represents all the questions I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8288)|
| 2:18:13| from people over the past nine months talking to a few thousand folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| Thank you, Council Member Smith. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8297)|

| 2:18:21| I just want to say that we've had a lot of robust conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| around this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| The past 16 months or so, the spotlight has really been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8308)|
| 2:18:32| on Knoxville's black history as it relates to urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| which a lot of us in the community refer to as urban removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| The Stadium Project will be one of the largest economic investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| in East Knoxville that I will probably see in my lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8324)|
| 2:18:48| and all of us sitting in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| We have an opportunity to really see some great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| come out of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| We know the advantages that it's going to have to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| and the advantages that it can bring to the East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| especially the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| When we talk about urban renewal, we have to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| what is the mechanism, what are the avenues and channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8348)|
| 2:19:11| that we have to help with the restoration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8351)|
| 2:19:14| of what was taken from the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| Absolutely one of the goals, the singular goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| of the African American Equity Restoration Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| that this project can indirectly contribute to that restoration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| Goals are aspirational, commitments are dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| And while there are reporting goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| Mr. Boyd has given community commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| That's going to take a lot of intentionality and accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| on everyone who's involved in this Stadium Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| to ensure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8390)|
| 2:19:54| One of the things that I'm really big on is making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8394)|
| 2:19:58| that we provide opportunity and access for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| in the East Knoxville, especially the black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8401)|

| 2:20:36| then it was a failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| We can look back and we can see that East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| the heart of East Knoxville, communities in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8443)|

| 2:21:15| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| It looks like that Mr. Boyd, who I don't disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8478)|
| 2:21:23| has done a lot of philanthropy in the East Knoxville community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| and across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| Some things that I'm sure that he's done that we don't even know about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| that he's done, and it is appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| It doesn't take Mr. Boyd to be intentional about that accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| Jim Development, Steve Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8498)|

| 2:21:45| all the members of the Sports Authority Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| American Cannon, Murray Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| myself and my colleagues on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| our county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| and even the private developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| to make sure that this investment creates the opportunity for rebuilding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| of black wealth and the black middle class here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| So today is not the end of the conversation around the stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| or the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| As you've heard through a lot of this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| there will be other opportunities for approvals to come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| and have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8543)|
| 2:22:26| And so I want to say that we have to have that intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| of holding all of us accountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| and I'm committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| I believe in unions, worked in Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8556)|
| 2:22:40| and I do believe that there's a place in this development for union labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| But we have to be intentional about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| And so today I just want to say that I'm going to support this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| on the strength of everything that I just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| because it is bigger than any of us sitting in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| It is about the black community and the restoration of the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| So I do want to disclose that I am a volunteer member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| of the Knoxville Area Urban League Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| I receive no compensation whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| Therefore, there is no reason for me to recuse myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| and I will be voting on this stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| And I hope that my colleagues will support it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8597)|

| 2:23:58| We can do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8638)|

| 2:24:24| Okay, the motion for calling for the question carries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8664)|
| 2:24:26| so now we vote on the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8666)|
| 2:24:33| Okay, so now we're back to the main motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| So we don't get any further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| All those in favor on Item 11E, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| I would like some further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| Well, the call for the question closes debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| That's the calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| So now we're back to the main motion, which is on 11E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| What about the motion I made to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8700)|
| 2:25:03| Councilmember Singh, as I recall, you did not make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| I said as soon as discussion is over, this is the motion I'm making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| Mr. Johnson, did Councilmember Singh make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| You never stated that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| You said that you were going to, but you didn't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| We can make a motion to withdraw calling the question to extend further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8722)|
| 2:25:31| You've already taken the vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| so what you can do is you can make a motion to reconsider the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| And it would only require a majority vote to win that because you're still in the same session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| I don't think it was vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8745)|
| 2:25:46| So it would have to be somebody who voted for it who makes the motion to reconsider, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| So just for point of clarification, I did not know that I would circumvent any additional motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8751)|
| 2:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| So I would, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| Make a motion to reconsider the calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| Let me make a motion to reconsider the calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8766)|
| 2:26:07| Okay, there's a motion made and seconded to reconsider the calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| So yes, vote, yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| If you vote yes, then you will reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8774)|
| 2:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| A yes vote on this motion before you means we'll reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| And we'll vote again on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| All those in favor of reconsidering this call for the question, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8788)|

| 2:26:30| Okay, we'll reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| Now back to the motion to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8791)|
| 2:26:34| All those in favor of calling for the question, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8794)|

| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8803)|
| 2:26:44| Mayor, I think there's some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8804)|
| 2:26:47| So can we get the law director to let everybody know what they're voting on right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8814)|

| 2:26:57| So when you voted to reconsider, that puts the question of the call for the question back before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8817)|
| 2:27:03| So what you're voting for now is the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8823)|
| 2:27:07| So if you vote yes, you're voting yes, call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| If you vote no, you're voting no, I'm not ready to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8834)|
| 2:27:15| But instead of voting, Vice Mayor McKenzie, I think, could withdraw her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8835)|
| 2:27:20| It's already been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8840)|
| 2:27:21| It's already been passed, so we have to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| Well, now we're back to the call for the question and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| We'll do a roll call vote because we're reconsidering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| And if you guys do not pass the call for the question, then it can go back to Ms. Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8850)|
| 2:27:35| and she can propose a motion that she mentioned but didn't actually do before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8859)|

| 2:27:44| Let's do a roll call vote because the verbal vote was a little fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8864)|

| 2:27:53| A no means that we'll return to debate, and Ms. Singh can propose an amendment if she wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211116_202111?start=8873)|
