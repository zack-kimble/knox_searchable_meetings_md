| 0:13:00| This is my good friend, Martha Rose Woodward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| She actually is also a constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| She lives in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| She is one of our local treasurers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| She has written so many books about local landmarks and local history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| and she's just an amazing writer, and she's a retired school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| And every time I talk to her, there's something new going on that she's getting involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| or something where she's extending herself even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=809)|

| 0:13:38| So you never know what's going to be going on when you talk to Martha, but there's always something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| And in the last couple of years, she told me she had gotten together with a friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| and put together this book, Watermelon for Everyone, which is a fabulous book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| You can see ours is kind of bent and scratched and probably has watermelon on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| I've used it with my girls because it's got recipes and science experiments and lesson plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| and we've had the best time with this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| But what's really exciting about it is that it won an international cookbook award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| for her little book on watermelon that she wrote here locally in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| So we're incredibly proud of Martha and the work that she's done locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| and delighted that she has had her work internationally recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=864)|

| 0:14:35| and to thank her for being such a local treasure for all of us and all she does for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=875)|

| 0:33:20| Okay. We've had, there's been a lot of discussion in regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| And so what I would like to do is I've asked Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Bussler, and Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| I believe, to sit on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| And we're going to ask the Law Director's Office to have a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And all of the current providers, Carnes Volunteer, Rural Metro, Seymour, Knoxville Rescue Squad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2017)|
| 0:33:47| and the City of Knoxville are going to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| And I think what the idea would be to all of the ideas to come and everything be placed on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| have a discussion, and it could be a 12-month process, it could be 18, it could be 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| But I'd like for us to have a discussion in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| And does anybody have any comment about the makeup of the board or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| What I see the process doing is the committee coming together and having discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| and then also a couple of times over the year seeking public input, throwing some ideas up on the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| and hoping that everybody participates and all of the models are placed up for discussion, current model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2066)|
| 0:34:37| any other model that somebody else may be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| First, I'd like to express my appreciation for the confidence in appointing me to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| And I agree that it will be months, if not years, of discussion at finding what might be an agreeable solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2088)|
| 0:34:58| if we need a solution, to fire protection in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| Again, naming the committee, did you have someone from the executive branch or from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| I was going to have purchasing on there, because I think if there was an RFP process, they would be expert in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| And then also citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Are you expecting this committee to take all the input, or would we have a couple of citizen members of the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| Which would be hard to determine who that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Well, I thought about that for a while, and I had several people that would like to sit on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| Who do you eliminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| So I would rather the public just provide input and maybe talk to IT about setting up a website for discussion as time progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2135)|
| 0:35:47| Anybody else on discussion about setting that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Everybody good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| And I think it's important to note that my desire is for all of the current providers to be a part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| and nobody to disappear, and I think there was some concern of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| And so as we move forward, I hope that the current providers are a part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| and hopefully a part of the solution if we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| So when's the first meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Well, let's get everybody together first, but we'll set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| Discussion of the rules of the commission changing the meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| Chair, so we had a rules committee meeting today, and a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2191)|
| 0:36:40| Several commissioners were present for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| The sole agenda item was the start time of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| We did not discuss the work session or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| but the committee will have on the agenda next month a recommendation, our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2213)|
| 0:37:03| that we push the start time of this meeting, the county commission meeting, to 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| with beer boards starting at 4 o'clock, and a hard time that we say the zonings will start at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2231)|
| 0:37:22| Did we say or immediately after?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| I'm trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I think we put words that say or immediately after the commission meeting being over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| So that was our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| It was not a unanimous vote, but it was definitely preponderance of the committee members that felt this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2255)|
| 0:37:46| Have you done the logistics on it yet to see if it works out room-wise and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| Generally speaking, I think we have this room on that Monday all night, so that should not be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| The only time it will be an issue is when we have commission on a holiday Tuesday where city council meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| So we will have to work around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| There are a couple of those, Veterans Day and something else, Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| There's two or three of those a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| That's what we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I'll lay out a logic, and then I'll let other committee members speak or anyone else speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2300)|
| 0:38:28| Logic being that we found, and I don't think there's any argument, when we have issues that have strong public opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2308)|
| 0:38:42| we generally push those conversations back until after folks get off work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| So really, you know, there's a mindset if it's not broken, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| But I think we're missing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| We're missing opportunities to have the public voice and the public come and take part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2335)|
| 0:39:03| I know where to put a tax on the department heads, but, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| while we discuss, you know, the salaried employees, they're not, you know, covered by laws of overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| and also we may try to work out and get with HR and work out some kind of comp time, but that can be worked out in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| That's up to the mayor and his staff to do what is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| But we feel that I think the committee felt strongly that this is for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| It's a more transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| During that time, it doesn't seem to be an issue with their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| So with that, I'll be quiet and let those others speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| As Sam said, it was not a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| I was the lone vote against it, and I will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| And if we put this to a vote next month, I would like to have a friendly amendment to the fact that it be on a temporary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2395)|
| 0:40:05| Because we tried this once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| It didn't help the tenants any, so we came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| So that's all I'm going to say today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I'll say my speech again for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| The only other discussion, part of my discussion would be the thought process would be moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| and I don't know how you do this logistically, but moving zonings back to the work session day at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| and that way you've got 2 o'clock and 5 o'clock, and then you've got 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| and your commission meeting can go into the evening, and you don't have to stop for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| There may not be time between their meeting and the NPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| It may be a timing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| We'll have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| And the only other issue that we discussed during that is, say it passes next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| there's no guarantee that we'll start in November, because NPC has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| they've already pushed out things that say, hey, if this passes, fine, if it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| you can push it to commission meeting, and they actually list the date of the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| So there's several things like that that the legal department is going to work out for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| So we'll figure out, again, if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| It may not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| If it does, I don't want anyone to think that if it passes in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| it's going to take effect in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| It may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Maybe in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| As we talk about this, I think you mentioned that if we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| that zonings would then be either at 7 or right after commission ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| and I think that we have to sit, or we have to stick to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| or we've always been advised in the past to stick to a regular start time for zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| so that people know when they have to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| that it's not fair to just say when commission meeting ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| I think you put that in there in case you're on a topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| and you don't want to stop that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| It's more going later than opposed to starting before 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| But I know in the past, too, when we've had this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| where commission meetings have run right up until zonings and we still weren't done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| we would normally end the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| because people were told to be here at a particular time to take up zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| That we would stop whatever we were doing at that point in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| do zonings, and then reconvene to finish up the commission meeting at the end of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| So I would really hate to see us get into doing that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| It's just not good practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner Olympic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| Yeah, and we discussed that, and we asked the law department about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| And that's the reason we put 7 o'clock or immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| So if we are in a discussion about something that we don't break it off right then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| that it may be 7.05 that it starts or 7.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| But it was just to say that it will start at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| But I kind of like the idea of moving it, zonings, to the workshop week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| and maybe start it at 4 instead of 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| You want it at 5 because you want people to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| When you all were talking about this, one thing that came to mind is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| how are we going to advertise and how are we going to get this out to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| so more and more people will know if we do change the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| that they will get in the habit of coming here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| Right now they're in the habit of 2 o'clock or 1.45 to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| And if we don't some way get them really involved and not try to jump into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| and maybe start sometime next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| but advertise that we are going to change, how will we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| Well, I think we would use notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| and then we'd use the folks there on the front row to help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| I think they would probably do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| But it would be noticed and just kind of make it public aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| website, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Anybody else have a discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| So it will come in the form of a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| I guess it will be a rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I'm sorry, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Let me say that I probably spoke too long this afternoon or earlier today on this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| but I think one of the things that we are all concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| there's probably no one out here that wants to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| but we're not here for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| We're here for the community, for the voters, and for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| And there are people out there who own businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| and, yes, they can come down here at 2 o'clock because they own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| But if you're an employee for a company, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And even if they just want to come and talk about their neighborhood, they can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| So it doesn't necessarily have to be something that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| If they just want to talk to us as a body, I think we should make that available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| and keep in mind that we're here for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| We're not here for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| I believe the only concern that I'll express would be a cost concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2712)|
| 0:45:24| The person that's working the second shift can't come then because we're doing it in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| But back to the cost concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I see one elected official and maybe some department heads here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| There needs to be a real fine explanation of the cost associated with us moving everything we do after 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2739)|
| 0:45:52| And that will help me decide where I think we need to be with this because it's true we need to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2752)|
| 0:46:01| when people are looking to do business with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| But we, the county, are doing business every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| and the people doing business with us may just see us once every two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| So cost will be a factor in how I decide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| And that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| I'm looking for Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| And I think, again, I'm assuming most of the department heads are salaried employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| but maybe he could come next month and talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| If there's no comp time, what the financial impact will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I don't think it's going to be significant, if anything, but I'll look to him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| Anything else to come before the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| We will be adjourned until 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| Madam Clerk, you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| First item up is Ron Worley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Is anybody here from Worley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Have you all had any contact with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Our contact is actually with a fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| Worley is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| The applicant was a Scott Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| So there must be a disconnect there because I believe our staff has been contacting the Scott Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| Ron is typically a residential builder, so this might be outside of his wheelhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| Can your staff, by our rule, it rolls to the next month without vote or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| So it will roll to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| But if you'll make contact with him in that letter, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| to state the potential for it to be voted down if they don't show up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2891)|

| 0:48:20| The next item would be Jeffrey Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2900)|

| 0:48:28| On page 18, request of Jeffrey Morris for rezoning from PR plan residential to A agricultural property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| located Southside Highland View Road, Westside Shade Weaver Road in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| Mr. Morris is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I'm seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| For MCC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| For MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Commissioner Bussard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Pull your mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| You do have, you know, plan residential, and you'll have, I guess, neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| But when you go to agricultural, there's a lot of other uses that you can use on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| And I just want to say there may be some unforeseen consequences headed down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| because there could be some people come in later on that said, you know, it was this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| and used some things out there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| But you could have people coming back up here and speaking to why we did rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| But that's just some unforeseen consequences that may happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| I talked to the owner, and he stated that it was bought by another owner for rezoning, to get rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Got rezoned, went bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| There's deficiencies on the property, cemetery and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| So there's a reason that it didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| And he's actually an adjoining landowner and wants to keep it ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| So that's the down zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Like I said, with the down zoning, there were some things if people wanted it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| it could come back to haunt us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140922?start=3003)|
