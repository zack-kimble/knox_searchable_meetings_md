| 0:00:30| I'll call the meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:32| Welcome to the July Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=32)|
| 0:00:35| Agenda Review Meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=35)|
| 0:00:37| At this time, I'll turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=37)|
| 0:00:41| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| I just have a few updates for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| But first of all, I'd like to introduce one of our newest staff members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| which is Jessica Kitts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| She's there with Dory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| She just recently joined us, so we're really excited to have her on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| She's an administrative assistant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| so you will see her helping Dory with the Planning Commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| But she will also be helping out with the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| their meetings, as well as Historic Zoning and Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:10| Welcome, Jessica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| So we have recently launched Phase 1 of a digital application form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:25| and this was officially launched a couple weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| but has been in the works for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| I would say at least a couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| The new form allows users to enter application data directly into a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:39| that captures all that information electronically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| and then it can be checked for accuracy by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| and then it imports into a database that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| that one of our staff developed many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| that we use for all of our case data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| This Phase 1 is internally facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| so eventually I'll talk a little bit about Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| but this is just for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| We are testing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| We're hoping that it's going to help streamline the way we do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| the way we take in applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Some of you may be familiar that we have been taking in PDF applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| We quickly launched allowing people to just submit a PDF when COVID hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| to allow people to continue doing their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| without having to come down to our offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| So we're really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| We think it's going to be a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| There's a bit of a learning curve on our side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| but we have some really talented staff that are developing it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Another important piece of this is that there will be integration with KJIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| So once we get to Phase 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| it's going to be really easy for applicants to identify the parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| It will link up to KJIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| It will just be much more interactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| and easier for us to verify what they're submitting is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=177)|
| 0:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Additionally, advanced NOCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| The project team is continuing to work on scenario planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| I think I mentioned that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| We hosted a virtual lunch and learn session last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| to help our committee members better understand the basics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| of what scenario planning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| It's kind of a scenario planning 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| We do have that available on our YouTube channel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| so you can go back and watch it if you're so inclined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| We did broadcast that live as well as allowing our committee members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| to participate via Zoom so they could ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| And then next week we will be holding additional meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| to discuss the scenario planning more in-depth with those committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| So please keep your eye on that website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| and we'll continue to send out information as we get results from this next effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:04:00| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Just jump right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| I'm going to use it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Let me talk about the ordinance real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Make sure I'm on the right slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| So what you see up on the screen here is for item number 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| This item was postponed last month by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| In the original request that was submitted by the City's Plans Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| and Inspection Department, it was specifically to address standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| associated with drive-thru facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| and the location of lanes and windows on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| And just for a quick reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| drive-thru facilities are permitted in the CH district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| That's a highway commercial as well as the CR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| which is a regional commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| as well as the general commercial district as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| So during the June meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Chairman Hill had asked for a 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| and the Planning Commission approved for us to take into additional consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| what the impacts might be to the CG district, so we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| And so after further review, staff, you'll see in the top of the screen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| was what was originally proposed by Plans Review and Inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| which was to drive-thru facility windows and lanes may not be placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| between the street and associated building in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| So the text in red is what was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| And so after further review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| staff is now recommending adding or corner side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| to what is in the code currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| and then striking out drive-thru lane windows and lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| may not be placed between the street and associated building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| By adding or corner side, it really does provide clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| to where on the property these can be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| and very explicitly leaves out front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| So you don't have drive-thru facilities and windows located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| along a main thoroughfare between the front of a building and the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| And I can show you here, this is in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| This gives you an illustration of what we mean by corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| As you all know, there's a lot of smaller lots along our corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| a lot of small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| And this will allow those properties to locate a drive-thru facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| as long as it's on that corner side rather than prohibiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| and in particular, in all districts in the CHCR and CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| Anybody have any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| I know that might be a little nuanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Director Brooks, isn't it based on the frontage of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| In which direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Could it be fronting on the secondary street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| That would be their frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| and their corner would be the primary street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| There might be some cases where that would come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:24| Are you saying if it was, say, on Broadway or on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| that the side street might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| Kingston Pike and Morrell Road, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| So the building could be facing Morrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and their drive-thru would be on the other corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| which would be facing Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| Food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| No, I mean, that would be an interpretation that would be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| by Plans Review and Inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| because they make those types of interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| What we're trying to prevent is something along the lines of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| which these are located on Chapman Highway and Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| where you really do just have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| that's what you're looking at for the main thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| And keep in mind that drive-thru facilities in the CG district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| still would have to come through planning as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| In its original form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| the big detriment was anything on a corner lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| really prohibited drive-thrus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| So you think about, Nathaniel, where you work at First Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| it's triple frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| and you look at your drive-thru there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| that would be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| So it may not 100% solve everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| but other than the advanced auto, I think, on Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| I can't think why someone would build their frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| not to the major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| I don't know why they would turn it to Morrell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| but they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| But I think this is the lesser of the two evils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| If the frontage along the secondary street...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| Commissioner Feltz, can you pull your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| If the frontage on the secondary street, do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| Hey, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| Don't confuse me, don't confuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Say your example up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| if the longer side of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| is on the secondary street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| they may say we can do more on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| If it's a narrow frontage on the main street on arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| they might face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| I mean, it's quite possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| You would never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| and I'm trying not to add more to our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| but you would never put drive-through facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| in a specific zone being all special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| I mean, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| You could make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| That's not currently how the code reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| In the highway commercial and the regional commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| it's not a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| It's by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| Yeah, I was just talking about a specific zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| that we may want to leave a little flexibility in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| at least to be able to want to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| to make those judgment calls, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Commissioner, are you referring to specific areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| along a corridor or actually zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| Yeah? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Because in the CG, it is currently special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| in all CG zones, 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| What we're really trying to prohibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| think of the McDonald's on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| That's a terrible example of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| It has the drive-through facing Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| Well, that's kind of what I was going for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| is that was permitted by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I think this one came in before the new code was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Can you go back to the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| The original or the proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| That's where you had the two compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| Is there some way to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| what Pat and Chris are bringing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| by simply bringing back in the street concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| but saying the primary street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Something that designates what your point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| that for the main arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| that's what you don't want to have drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I think that gets into interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| So what is the primary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| It could be interpreted differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| all along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| So I think you're going to find along most properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| along our main thoroughfares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| like Broadway, Chapman, Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| that that frontage facing those streets will be the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| There will be a rare instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| where no, that's not going to be designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Like on a corner lot there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| no matter which street is the main street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| it still has to go on the side or the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| whichever one you count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| That's the main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Okay, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| We can turn this one, turn it over to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=773)|
| 0:13:10| Everything off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Do we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| I guess it would be up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| We think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Our chair cannot, though, unless he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=800)|
| 0:13:31| Second guessing already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Hey, bullpen over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=812)|
| 0:13:39| It's a tough crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| It's a tough crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| A bunch of Friday morning quarterbacks over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| Matt, are you going to correct him the whole meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| No, sir, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| I'm sure he's going to develop a cough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:39| That could be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| That could be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| That could be evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=881)|

| 0:17:14| Okay, we'll go ahead and get started if Liz is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| So the first one is item number 97C22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| It's a rezoning in South Knoxville request for Kandoro properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| The subject property is on the north side of Kandoro Avenue between Merrillville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| It is adjacent to heavy industrial zoning, mixed-use industrial zoning, and general commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1054)|
| 0:17:42| It is a six-acre site, and this area of Vestal is the site of the Kandoro Marble Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| and the adjacent parcel also has historic overlay zoning, which is what you see on the hatch there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| The Kandoro Marble Company was established in 1941 and was active until 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| It was once the leading producer of Tennessee pink marble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:09| In 1996, this entire site was deemed eligible for the National Register of Historic Places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| along with the adjacent showroom and garage, which now has the H1 overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| It's now home to a community art space called the Kandoro Arts and Heritage Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| which holds a community event every year called Vestival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| This is what the 1959 aerial looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| You can see a lot of extensive industrial activity occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| You can also see the Vestal Lumber Company to the north was still active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| By 1998 and 2000, you can see that there is a reduction in some of those heavy industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| and more vegetated ground cover is starting to show up in this corridor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| This is a most recent 2022 aerial, so there are still some heavy industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| However, this swath between Mayfield Avenue, which is on the north side here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1148)|
| 0:19:16| let me get my pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Mayfield Avenue, sorry, which is on the south side here to the railroad tracks located here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| This is more of a mixed-use industrial area and or mostly light industrial uses currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:39| This is an image showing building permits from 2001 to the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| The yellow permits that you see with dots on the map are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| The red ones are commercial, and the purple ones are industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| You can see in the last 21 years, there hasn't been a lot of activity for industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| At least related to permit activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| I would like to be able to show you Google Street View of this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:26| Or maybe not, actually, sorry, because we're having difficulties with switching over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| This is what the sector plan and the one-year plan looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| It actually shows up currently as heavy industrial for most of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| with the exception of the properties on the north side of Maryville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Those show up as light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| Light industrial recommends the IMU zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| However, heavy industrial does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| The sector plan was updated in 2011 for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:09| I would argue that when a more comprehensive update of the land use plan for this area is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| the consideration of showing just this swath as light industrial should be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:24| because of the dominant land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| Staff also is of the opinion that the uses permitted in the IMU zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| are much more extensive than those permitted in the IH zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Although the site has had heavy industrial zoning for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| it has not been used for heavy industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| The IMU zone would allow over 25 uses that aren't allowed in the requested IH zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:22:04| That is a list of those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| You can see that it's everything from an arts gallery to fitness studios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| community centers, multifamily dwellings, eating and drinking establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Industrial design is allowed, live entertainment, breweries, distilleries, and retail good establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:30| However, the IMU allows uses that are much more intensive in character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| such as an impound lot, heavy industrial uses, self-storage facilities that include outdoor storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:45| solar farms, outdoor storage yards generally, vehicle operation facilities, and waste transfer facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1365)|
| 0:22:56| For these reasons, staff is recommending to deny the request for IH zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| because it is not consistent with the surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| since this area has been transitioning to light industrial and other less intensive uses since the late 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Yeah. Do we have any idea? I know we're supposed to be just looking at the merits of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| and we say that every time we bring this up, but are they trying to do this just to market the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| Do they have a specific use or intent, or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| It's my understanding that they do have a specific use in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| and you could probably ask the applicant at the meeting on Thursday to elaborate more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| Is there any way to elaborate more on what they would actually like to do on that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| I'm just thinking big picture Knoxville, about how many pieces of vacant property that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:54| that is zoned heavy industrial that a community like ours may or may not need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| I'm just curious what opportunities we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| This may not be the best place for it from a transportation standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| but it used to be back in the 50s. It may need to be light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| I'm just curious if we are shutting out another piece that can't be used forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:19| close quote, and I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1459)|
| 0:24:28| Liz, what is the use of the property to the south of this tract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Let me go back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| Let me get the pointer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| On the opposite side of Candora Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| At this location, or here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, right there, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| So that does appear to be heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| so I will say there is some heavy industrial here and here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| My argument would be, though, that this area, this whole area in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| bisecting these heavy industrial areas really should be light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| It's like a gravel crusher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Yeah, it seems to be a mound of rock material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:20| One other thing to bring in, for what it's worth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| is the log haven area that's just across the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| This makes it look like it's incredibly far away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| but if you've driven that, it's much closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| That investment and the Candoro Art Center investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| are significant new jewels in Knoxville's scape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1543)|
| 0:25:50| The log haven artist residency just won the International AIA Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| I hope I got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| But it's bringing international attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| I can see a heavy industrial use being very detrimental to that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| Same for the Candoro Arts Facility that's just been restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| to immaculate state that's right beside this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| So I think that's important to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| To your point, Chris, that Knoxville has a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| leftover industrial areas that this may not be the right place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| for whatever the usage is being sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| There may be another place that could be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| I think we can move on to item number 11, 7A22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| It also has a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| This is Benjamin Mullins as the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| This is a two-acre site between Tazewell Pike and Old Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| north of Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| The sector plan shows this area currently as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and the applicant is requesting to go to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| They're also asking for a rezoning from RA, which it presently is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| to planned residential up to seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1640)|
| 0:27:27| This shows the zoning in this general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| So in May of 2001, this area was rezoned to planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| up to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| The subject property highlighted in blue is what the applicant would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| to rezone to planned residential up to seven dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| It would also require a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| The concept plan that was approved for this adjacent area that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| highlighting in red here shows a realignment of Old Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| and I believe the county is already going through the public engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| process of possibly closing a portion of Tazewell Pike here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| potentially putting in a roundabout at this location because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| complexity related to this intersection here at Luttrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Tazewell Pike, and Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| So there's a lot of activity at this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and it's pretty complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| So staff is recommending to deny medium-density residential because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:38| it's not compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Staff is recommending to approve planned residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| and we are recommending up to three dwelling units an acre because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| it's consistent with the surrounding development and recent decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| that have been made regarding density adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:29:03| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Can you point to where Murphy Road is on this map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Is it even showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| This is Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| This is Old Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| This is Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| This is Luttrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| So this is a problematic intersection at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:26| I've tried to hatch the area, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| that would potentially be closed if that goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Seeing no additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Move on to your next one, item number 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| which is the rezoning Worley Brook Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| This is a 20-acre parcel along Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| This is primarily large rural residential and agricultural lots with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| forested slopes leading up to Beaver Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| An area just to the east was rezoned to planned residential at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| dwelling units an acre in September 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| and a concept plan was approved for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Just this past April, showing a build-out of 2.9 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:19| The applicant is requesting for this RA zoned parcel to go to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| And to give you some idea of the topography of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| we have the slope map up here that shows the greater than 50 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| slopes in red leading up to the top of Beaver Ridge here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| So there are substantial slope constraints on the northern portion of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| The planned residential zone district would allow them to concentrate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| majority of the density in the flatter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| However, this is quite a narrow area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| And here you can see also where the forested hillside is in the aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:03| This is adjacent to Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| It is not adjacent to the new shod road improvements for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:14| The sector plan shows this area as low-density residential and hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| And again, the applicant is asking to go from RA zoning to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| residential up to five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:32| And staff is recommending up to three dwelling units an acre because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| consistent with the surrounding development and consistent with other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| decisions that have been made regarding density in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:50| I think the applicant will be requesting planned residential up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| dwelling units an acre at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| Liz, what's the width of the strip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Sorry, I think it is close to 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Let me measure it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| 80 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| Let me double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| I don't want to misspeak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:47| Liz, I came up with 272.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| That's a straight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| That was the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Yeah, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Yeah, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| I think the other one down the street was closer to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| Yep, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Like 280.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| Seeing no other questions, thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| I'll turn it over to Jesse for Adam's number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| Let her get hooked up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| 26, Steve Hall, 7S22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:48| Just waiting for the back screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| All right, so item 26, rezoning case 7S22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| This property is approximately 4.8 acres located on the southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| side of Greenwell Drive and the west side of Pedigo Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| which are both major collector streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| The applicant is requesting a rezoning from agricultural to planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| residential with a density up to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| which could result in a total of 19 units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| The surrounding zoning is mainly agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| though there are significant, there's a significant number of planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| residential and low-density residential subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| And the sector plan, the North County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| has the area designated as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| As you can see in the map, there are two streams on the north end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| that merge and pond into a tributary to form the Copper Ridge branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| leading to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| In some additional context, this parcel is currently forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| and it's on the interior edge of the planned growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| Staff recommendation is to approve planned residential at three instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| of four dwelling units per acre because it's more consistent with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| As you can see in this picture, well, sorry, it's a little small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| but planned residential, the large planned residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| to the north, that's approved at three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and it's at three in five out of the six PR zone properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| surrounding this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| There is one that was just south of here that was approved at 4.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| but staff recommendation was three for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| and it's not been developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| What's the one up to the northwest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| On the west side, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Northwest, drawing northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| It says PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| It's 2.3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| That's what it's developed at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| That's what it's zoned at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| I'm not sure what the actual density of that one is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And then this RA property just south, I measured that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| and that's just shy of three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| And so some of the reasoning for this is because it's more consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| with the surrounding density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| and the agricultural nature of many of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| It's also due to the environmental constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| You have two blue line streams that are merging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| and there is that 50-foot vegetative buffer required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| for stormwater considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| So with that in mind, we recommended three instead of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Are there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| All right, seeing none, I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| So agenda item number 29, rezoning case 7V22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| This property is about four acres on the eastern side of Fitzgerald Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| north of Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| Fitzgerald Road is a narrow local road, and Ball Road is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| The applicant is requesting a downzoning from PR up to five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| down to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| Here's the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| So this agricultural zoning request would be a minor extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| of agricultural zoning to the west and north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| You can see that the parcel is surrounded on three sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| by a planned residential subdivision, which was built around 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| called Hattie's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| And the sector plan has this listed as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| so ag zoning is in alignment with the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| And just for context, this is an aerial view from 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| So you can see that the subject property was surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| by what existed as farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And then it was included in a rezoning request that incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| a substantial amount of the property around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| The request was to rezone from ag and RA, low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| up to PR at five, and that was approved in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| And then the Hattie's Place subdivision was built starting in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| But as you can see, the subject parcel remains unchanged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| with a single house, an expansive field along their driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| and a patch of forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| This is similar to its neighbor to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| and similar to the agricultural properties to the west and north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| So there is controversy surrounding this case because neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| from the Hattie's Place subdivision are concerned about overgrown grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| chickens really kind of being a harbor for pests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Staff are recommending approval of the rezoning from PR to ag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| because it's consistent with the sector plan and with the existing land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| which does show just a single dwelling and substantial open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Unlike Hattie's Place subdivision, which has two access points to Ball Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| which is, as I said, a major collector, this property accesses Fitzgerald Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| which is a narrow local road that many other properties rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| to access their residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| And so ag is better suited to the character and intensity of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:40:01| and the properties that rely on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| There is a privacy fence that you can perhaps see in that small image at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| that surrounds the subject parcel where it adjoins Hattie's Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| So that does provide some distinction of land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| between the ag and the more intense residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| And this zoning image to the left, what's highlighted there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| what was previously agricultural before that rezoning in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| and that is this grassy lot that you're seeing in that image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| So I am happy to answer any questions about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| So would this be kind of like an example of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| you get a large piece of land and you get PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| and you cram density into part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| and then you go back and you didn't develop part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| and you request a rezone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| I mean, someone could come back later and request a new PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| at five dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| and build out this new subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| and the entirety of it would have more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| than was originally approved all at once originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Does that make sense what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| Like, we basically approved PR and then they're taking it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| Could somebody go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| It's just kind of odd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| and it's not really the intent of what PR is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| What did they build out that density to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| is part of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I don't think that they maximized all the density, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| When they built the property, they didn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| Yes, and my understanding is that the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| that they live on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| and were not part of the developer surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| I think the developer was an option holder at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| during the rezoning phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| but didn't end up purchasing this property or developing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| So I know that the current property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| have no intention of developing a PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| and wish to use it in a more agricultural manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| Jessie was current property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Do they own the other property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| No, they only own the parcel that's being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| They were not the original applicants on the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| So the concept plan for this PR zone never included this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| That makes more sense then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| No more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| We will move over to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Give him a minute for the next four items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| The first one is 6SD22C Andes Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| It's up on one screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Wait for it to come up on the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| This one was postponed from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| And there are still some things that need to work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| and they've provided staff more information now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| And one of the main concerns was how these lots at the end of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| curve in the road were going to work, how those driveways were going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I can show you zoomed in on that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| There is some other things that need to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| But just so you know, this property was rezoned to PR up to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| dwellings per acre and included this large area I'm showing in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| which is an existing house with two or, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| is an existing property with two residences on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| And that property owner also owned a larger property around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| But they're selling the density for this on their lot for this residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| So they're transferring density off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| They will retain the right to two dwelling units on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| The rest of the development is an attached development with 91 attached units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| and then three detached units along Troutman Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| They're asking for a reduction in the peripheral setback to 25 feet from 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| In doing so, they're proposing a privacy fence along the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2711)|
| 0:45:17| basically the external lot lines adjacent to residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| This is actually west, but on the plan here at south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| and along the eastern or northern lot line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| They're also proposing a fence along this curve because there are townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| This is actually north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| But when you have cars driving down this road at night with headlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| it would shine into those people's back of the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| So they're proposing that fence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| They are also asking for an 18-and-a-half foot front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| for the lots that are on the inside of this road ring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| I can show you that in closer detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Typically in those cases, actually I'm sorry, this is supposed to be lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| It's all the lots that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| I copied my previous information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| But I found out today that I put the wrong lot numbers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| So you got a blue sheet on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| But typically when a front setback is less than 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| we do require two car garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| A lot of times we see this go down to 15 feet instead of 18-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| 18-and-a-half actually meets standard car lengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| but also it might be a conversation if they don't want to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| two car garages for all those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| they might have a conversation on whether or not their depth is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| for two vehicles to be parked in their driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| and not overhang like the sidewalk that's in front of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:47:00| Just for a little bit of context of what's surrounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| To the north is an attached development at seven dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| Well, it's owned at seven dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| I'm not sure what the actual build-out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| but it is an attached residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Detached residential to the east and detached to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Troutman Lane, this is where they're proposing those three houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| like detached houses, which will have access to Troutman Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| And this is that house lot that will be retained with the two existing houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Asking for several variances for horizontal curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| is something that we see quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| They're asking for a 100-foot radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| which is a little lower than we would typically want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| but this is a private road system versus a public road system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| and they'll be required to put in or to record sight distance easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| in those corners to make sure that a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| or something else doesn't get built there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| and cut off sight distance around the corner for the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| There's some other random variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| like there's a small vertical curve variance in the middle of this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| and a broken back variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| There's nothing that staff feels is going to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| Hillside protection area, you can see on their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| this is a dotted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| They're really not proposing to protect any of the hillside area with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| There's about 1.56 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| The slope analysis recommends one acre of disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| so they'd be going over a half acre of disturbance on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| Something that they do have to deal with is a lot of off-site water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| that comes through their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| particularly on the east side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| but a couple of years ago, there was a property to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| that was approved for development on Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| The water from that property actually goes this direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| and ultimately goes under Troutman Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| on the east side of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| so they're having to capture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| and deal with it on their property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| There's also some water on the western side that they're going to have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| but the primary one is this one on the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| These will be basement houses, at least that's what they're proposing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| so there will be a lot of drop to the backs of those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| but with the basements, that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And they plan on filling the front of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| so they actually have a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:37| This is where I was mentioning all those internal lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| so it's actually lots 29 through 54| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| where they're requesting an 18.5-foot front yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| This is a private right-of-way with 40-foot private right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| with 25-foot road surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| It does have a sidewalk on one side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| throughout the development and all the way back to Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:08| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I know I didn't really touch too much on this kind of odd driveway situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| Really, other than it being odd from our design standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| talk to the utility companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| They've got to get the utilities there to each of those units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| They said it could be tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| but as long as they can make it work with all the regulations they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| they don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| They're also going to have to deal with the roadway connection driveways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| maximum and minimum driveway widths and curb cuts and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| Mike, how does staff justify changing the peripheral setbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| At what point do you recommend those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| and at what point don't you go from 35 feet to 25 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| That's fairly substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Sometimes it's context of what the neighboring development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| and whether they had something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| In this case, they're proposing a fence, a privacy fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| to help mitigate the smaller reduced setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| It could be different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| In this case, we felt that the privacy fence was an appropriate method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| to justify the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| With the two-car garage requirement, is that part of the permitting process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:44| Every detached, every house that's on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| is required to have two parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| If their driveway length is not long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| to support at least one or two parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| a lot of these townhouses will only have a one-car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| especially the skinny ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| If they only have a one-car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| then they have to put the second parking space in the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| If the driveway is not long enough to actually support that parking spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| then that's where we typically will start saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| okay, we've got to have at least a two-car garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| to make sure you have two legal off-street parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| When does that get enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| It would be in the permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| It would be picked up in permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Mike, you want to move on to item number 34?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| The lender development is on Jenkins Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| and it's for 22 detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| There is a variance request for intersection separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| which I'll explain in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| This one, they are requesting a peripheral setback reduction as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| and there's a staff recommendation to install high-visibility fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| adjacent to the cemetery property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| I think I accidentally left in some ‑‑ oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Yes, the cemetery property before grading starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| and removed after the houses are constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| So that's for the high-visibility fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Something that came up during the early parts of this review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| was concern from the neighboring property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| It's a ‑‑ I'd say it's a church property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| where it's a Friends of West Knox Friends Meeting House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| There is a cemetery on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| and I'll show you in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Let me get to this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| So this is Jenkins Road up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| The cemetery is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| You can see on the survey on the east side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| The closest burial plot is about 13 feet to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| so that would be somewhere in this range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Their main concern is making sure that the cemetery doesn't get damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| They don't want one of the operators, grading operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| accidentally going off track and causing some damage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| that you can't really replace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Once that kind of damage is done, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| So from a staff standpoint, we felt that it was justified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| to at least put up some kind of high-visibility barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| on the front end so that everybody knows where the property line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| and to stay away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| They're generally concerned about any type of disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| on their property along their entire property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| This is one of their concerns they've expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| From a staff standpoint, we felt it was at least the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| should be protected, the rest of the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| if the developer wants to extend that high-visibility fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| to be a good neighbor, to make sure that they stay off of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| then he can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| They should be doing that anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| but if they want to just give them a little extra protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| then they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| Stepping back to the context here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| so the property is what I'm highlighting here on Jenkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3329)|
| 0:55:35| Cedar Bluff is down to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Middlebrook Pike is kind of directly south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| and then Gallaher View is over to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| so this is in that Cedar Bluff-Gallaher View area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| There is a small planned residential subdivision to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| and an RA development to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| And I mentioned the intersection separation variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| So Capitol Boulevard is directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| They've offset their road at the request from staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| because if they lined it up with Capitol Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| they would actually have a sight distance problem going back to the northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| and it's better in this case to obtain that sight distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| and have the offset than have the sight distance problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| With the type of offset we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:31| cars exiting the subdivision and exiting Capitol Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| if they're going left, the car pulls out left here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| they're not going to hit a car turning left out of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| That's usually the problem that we want to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| is that a car was turning left out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| and then a car was turning left out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| That's back right there in the middle of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| So in this case, the offset is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| It's not the worst-case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| So staff is supporting this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| Any questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:13| Let the minutes reflect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Former Chair Phillips arrives late and leaves early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:26| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Okay, I don't see any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| That's what you call let go of the ski rope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| Okay, Mike, I think we can move on to item number 35, Buttermilk Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Okay, so number 35, Buttermilk Road, 7SC-22C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| So it's 102 lots on 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| and you'll probably hear concern or comments about the density on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| and whether it meets the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| I'll explain that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| But this property was rezoned to PR up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| on a total of 73 acres back in 2005, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| There are several road variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| A lot of that has to do with the entrance road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and how steep it is with the natural grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Essentially, the natural grade is pretty steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| And there are some horizontal curve variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| All these different curves on the outer loop have horizontal curve variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| but it's only being reduced to a point where no site distance variances are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| So it's not really too much of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Just for some context, Buttermilk Road is where primarily where this is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| It actually has furniture on Pitman Drive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| They're not utilizing that connection to Pitman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| It's just going to be common open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| So Watt Road is to the southwest and Hardin Valley is to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| And then there's a Vulcan quarry just to the southwest of the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| And Vulcan owns the property just to the west adjacent to this property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Vulcan doesn't have an approval for expansion of the quarry on the adjacent site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| My guess is they bought it as this buffer around their quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| but that's just my guess at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:36| Okay, so the density question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| So the full PR up to 2.5 million per acre district includes 19 acre property or parcel here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3579)|
| 0:59:49| 22 acres here, and about five acres just to the north on Buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| So the current property owner was the one that put these properties together and had them rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| had the full 73 acres rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| In 2011, he sold 19.35 acres on the south side of Pitman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| And then in 2013, he sold 22.35 acres to the same person just on the north side of Pitman Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:23| And basically at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| he went through use on review approval to create five lots on Buttermilk on five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| So those are one acre lots essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| And then those have been sold off as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| In 2020, the developer had a concept plan approved for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| That's the same property that we're talking about today for 70 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| And so that concept is actually still active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| It's still they could go and start that permitting process today if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| But they decided to go ahead and turn in a new concept plan, development plan for 102 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:17| When we look at this, so back in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| the decision was made that they could utilize the entire acreage of the 73 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| so NPR at 2.5 towards this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| It would be about 180 units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| They're at 102 with this property, and then there's five extra up on Buttermilk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| And, you know, you have the one house that's been built down on Pitman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| They're still well underneath the 2.5 dwellings per acre for the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| So that's how we're approaching this proposal from a density standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| If you looked at the net density just for their piece, their 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| it's more like four less dwellings per acre just for their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| I will say that, you know, from a contextual standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| having the large lots along Buttermilk is contextually appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| The large lots along Pitman is contextually appropriate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| What we're talking about is, you know, sandwiched between those two is the more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| is the higher density more typical subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| which is a lot more out of view than if it was right up against those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| So from a contextual standpoint, looking at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:40| it's kind of meeting the intent of being similar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| conditionally similar to the rest of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| It's just the inner part that is more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| not quite as visible is going to be much more intensely built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| Just wanted to give you an idea of what this entrance road looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| and why there's some variance issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| So a typical road shouldn't go over 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| They can ask for up to a 15% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Basically, the natural grade is getting them close to that 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So that's what they're asking for, the 15% grade from Buttermilk Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| down into their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| And because of the steepness of that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| this first intersection in particular gets a bit complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| They're, you know, with the variance request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| they're still within reasonable road design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| It's not an unsafe situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| but this is not what our standards would explicitly require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| Then the other variances are pretty typical intersection grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| up to 3% in some areas, the horizontal curves with a radius of 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:54| Like I said, those will not require site distance easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| They do have a sinkhole in the middle of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| That's what they're staying away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| The original plan from 2020 had a road going straight through the sinkhole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| so that design didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| That was part of the necessity to modify their concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Yeah, so when it comes to a PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| I guess go back to the timeline of the last however many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| So if it's all zoned at a certain potential density and you sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| this is I guess sort of hypothetical, you sell off half of it to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| is it just a race to whoever can submit a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| to fulfill the density within both those tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| The way this one happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| not the way we probably want to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Yeah, but that's how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Yeah, it's kind of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| You could sell it into five sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| and then one of the sections fulfills the entire density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| whoever gets to it first essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| Yeah, I'd say that this was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3908)|
| 1:05:14| discussions and determination of how much acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| and density they're allowed to, which happened in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| and if they still have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| They're still within their vesting on that original approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| so we feel we can't really alter what they've been told in the past on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| The best-case scenario is that someone goes through the USUN review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| or the development review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| in more of an open approval process with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| or has something explicitly written into contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| that say what the density allowed is and parcels that are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| But, you know, I think in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| this was 2013 when this was sold, 2011, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| and the person has basically a horse farm and one house on those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| that they had no intent of doing anything more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| was, I guess, the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| For whatever it's worth, I was on commission when this came through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| and there was quite a bit of opposition on Pitman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| because that road was only about 11 or 12 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| and you could barely even the postmaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| and, you know, couldn't even pass a car down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| And this was some sort of compromise to do kind of a nontraditional cluster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| to where he would never develop any of that stuff along Pitman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| never even access it, and then keep everything up the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| I remember all that stuff, so not advocating one way or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| but I do remember that there was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| around not trying to develop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Yeah, I think there was a 2008 concept approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| or at least presented that did have this lower portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| as being part of a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and then it was brought back later with no access to Pitman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| and concentrated in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Mike, you want to move on to the plan development request in South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| Yeah. So this one had been postponed since April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| The developer has had several meetings with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| and then adjusted his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| So this is in the old Giffen School in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| And I'll show you a context in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| So as part of a plan development, there's two steps in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| The first step is the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| The second step is the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| So they're in their first part here, in the preliminary plan phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| And as part of that, they have to provide a plan document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| that talks about how they're going to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| and also to request waivers to the underlying zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| which in this case is RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| And what they want...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| So I listed out the three waivers that they're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| The RN2 zone does not allow multifamily, and that's what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| So they're going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| One of the waivers is to allow multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| The second waiver is to basically state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| how much density they're going to have for multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| which is what they're requesting is one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| per 3,500 square feet of land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| What that equals is essentially the number of units that they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| which is 77 dwelling units on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| And the last waiver is to allow more than one primary structure on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| In the RN...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| There's three zone districts in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| that do not allow more than one primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| It's the EN zone, the RN1, and the RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| In all the other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| you could have more than one primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| So you could have townhouse development all in one lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| or multifamily, whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| So that's the purpose of that last waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| is to allow two new structures to be built on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| as well as rehabilitating the existing school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| So I'm going to flip over to their plan documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| This might be a little easier to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| since it's already kind of in a presentation style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| So this is the existing school building that they're going to retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| It does have a historic preservation easement on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| so they can't tear that down very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| They purchased it through...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Knox Heritage got it from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Knox Heritage installed it to this developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| And this is just another image of the existing building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| that they're going to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I'm going to flip past this real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| Just from a context standpoint...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| Let me go back to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| So obviously this is Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| This is downtown at UT, the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| So the Giffen Square property is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| You have Island Home Community, the river downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| and Baker Creek is just to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| Iams Nature Center to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| The school building sits on top of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| You have Baker Creek that kind of wraps it on two sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| and there is a neighborhood park to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So Beach Street then goes down to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| The name of the street is escaping me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| but it's a short distance back over to James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| There is a bus route that's nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| If you look at their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| it seems like there's a lot of parking here, and there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| And that's part of the neighborhood compromise that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| The neighborhood did not want them...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| Or did not want, I guess, a lack of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| so that there was a lot of people parking on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| so they compromised to at least provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| a certain amount of parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| make sure that the neighborhood is okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| The original plan had a community building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| kind of on the backside of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| as well as, I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| it was three or four structures for residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| wrapped around, and that included 99 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| They've reduced it to 77 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| and are only planning two new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| And in the structure closest to Beach Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| that's where their community space is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| The community space is going to be open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| to the neighborhood residents as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| That's one of their benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| community benefits that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| That's what the community members wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| They didn't want the community space kind of tucked far away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| in the backside of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| They wanted it to be a lot more publicly facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| feel like it's more part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| The structures themselves are two to three stories tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| You can kind of see from a cut through the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| this is, if you look at the bottom ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| this is Beach Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| This would be a residence on the opposite side of Beach Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| So these are three-story buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| and then it will kind of drop off to Baker Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| and then you have more residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| over towards South Haven Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| And this is a cut through looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| through the existing school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| So the school building itself will be taller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| than the new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| And these are some of the images that kind of go for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| from a design standpoint, units and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:13:07| I already mentioned the waivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| but this is basically what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| They're in the RN2 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| allow multi-families of permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And then in the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| have 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| as a minimum lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| And then the last waiver is to delete the portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| or delete the section that restricts their site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| to only one primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| So anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Or, Amy, do you have anything else to add to this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| Feel free to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| The parking increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| so is it going to be all pervious paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| or just the amount above the maximum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| I don't think they're going to go over the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| The code said it's on page 12 of their case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| If they do go over the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:16| they can go, I want to say it's either 20% or 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| over the maximum of the provide pervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Okay, so only the amount above that is pervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| They're not requesting a deviation from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| So whatever they're permitted to do by zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| was what they could request during the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So we still have to see the final plan on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| which will be more detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| Can you say anything about the loss of the walking trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| I think there was a walking trail in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| that got postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| So, I mean, the walking trail is still a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4499)|
| 1:15:08| It's just going to be more of a discussion with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| on whether they want to have that walking trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| or participate in that and develop it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| So in the final plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| they could work something out and show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| They can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| There's nothing that says they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Commissioner Adams, I think that would be a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| for the developer, the applicant for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I know there's a lot of conversation that he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| during those public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| when he was meeting with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| about that type of amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4541)|
| 1:15:48| Amy, isn't this the second plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| that we've had come through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Or have we had more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| We've had more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| This will be the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| We've only had two go completely through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| the stadium and then the VMC project on 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| Just for refreshing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| it maintains the underlying zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| in the event of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| So if they were to walk away from this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| someone could pick up the plan and take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| Otherwise, they'd either have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| to the plan development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| or they could develop it as R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4583)|
| 1:16:34| That's all our items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Any other items for discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220712-agenda-review?start=4602)|
