| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Good evening, everyone, like to call to order the meeting of the Knox County Commission on this Monday, March 23 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=30)|
| 0:00:42| Before we begin, I'd like to just take a moment to welcome everybody back together here at the city county buildings, main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=42)|
| 0:00:49| We're returning together in person after several months of meeting in a virtual environment, and after a long and difficult year for all of us, and for the community we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=49)|
| 0:00:58| In some ways this pandemic has brought out the best in people, and in other ways the pressure of everything might have caused some real strife, both very natural things when dealing with a serious crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=58)|
| 0:01:09| It's also been a year and we've lost people closest to us, family members, friends, colleagues and constituents, and we will remember and honor them in profound ways during an unforgettable time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=69)|
| 0:01:21| Regardless how we got through things. Here we are now, and there's a lot to be proud of our government pressed on. We didn't delay major decisions but we came together in a fair and a transparent way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=81)|
| 0:01:31| And we never stopped working for the people of Knox County. So I want to express my appreciation to all of you for working through it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| No doubt we'll look back at this time we'll have certainly learned a lot. All that to say thank you commissioners and welcome back, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=98)|
| 0:01:50| Mr. Garrett here, Mr. Smith here, Mr. Ward here, Mr. Schoenmaker here, Mr. Hill here, Mr. Butler here, Mr. Baylor here, Mr. Daly here, Mr. J here, Mr. Biggs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=110)|
| 0:02:02| All 11 members are present. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Commissioner Lundy, would you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=128)|
| 0:02:28| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Unless I hear any objections, here's how I intend to conduct tonight's meeting. Back to sort of the standard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=148)|
| 0:02:41| First we'll set the agenda in public forum, then we'll jump into the agenda and presentations and move on from there. Do I hear any objections? Commissioner Baylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=161)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. No objections. I did have a couple of requests, if possible. One would be if our county mayor might be given a few minutes to address commission at the beginning, perhaps at the public forum, to speak to some pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=175)|
| 0:03:12| And also, would it be possible, at the pleasure of the board or the chair, to move item 43 to in front of the education consent calendar so it could be heard in conjunction with the spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=192)|
| 0:03:37| 43, the ordinance? In front of the education. I'll look around to ask for opinions. I feel like that would be a bit of a lengthy discussion. I mean, it's up to the body whether or not they want to put that ahead of sort of getting the school stuff out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=217)|
| 0:04:04| I just was suggesting it because I know there are a number of people here who are interested in it that some of them may even be county employees that might not otherwise need to be here until the end, but it's at the pleasure of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=244)|
| 0:04:16| Does anybody have a strong opinion about that either way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| Again, I kind of agree with you, Mr. Chairman. I don't want to hold up our colleagues from Knox County Schools because there's been three items pulled for discussion from schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=262)|
| 0:04:34| So, you know, I guess if it's the pleasure of the body, you could do it before section L on our agenda or in front of number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=274)|
| 0:04:48| I'm seeing a couple of nodding heads. I think move it before the general consent, but after education, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| All right. Any other comments on tonight's meeting moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| I'm also going to call, in addition to the mayor, I'll also have a slot in the beginning to ask Dr. Buchanan for an update on some health related items, so I'll add that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=298)|
| 0:05:09| All right. Proceeding on amendments to the addition tonight. The additions are 2 and 38. There's only one withdrawal. That is number 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=309)|
| 0:05:21| There are no deferrals and non-consent items include 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 18, 31, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 60, 61, 62, 63, 62, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63, 63| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=321)|
| 0:05:51| 45 and 46. Once again that's 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 18, 31, 38, 41 through 46. Any other non-consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=351)|
| 0:06:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| Motion to set the agenda as the chairman has stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| Second. Second by Commissioner Hill. First by Commissioner Smith. All those in favor please say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=376)|
| 0:06:27| Ayes have it. I'm going to start our public forum off by welcoming our Mayor, Mr. Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| to join us at the podium. After that I'll call on Dr. Buchanan and then we will have our speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| Mayor Jacobs, welcome to County Commission. Good to see you again. Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=399)|
| 0:06:51| Glenn Jacobs, City County Building here in Knox County, Tennessee. Thank you for allowing me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| moment. There's been a lot of talk about the Knox County Board of Health and a decision that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=415)|
| 0:07:04| body will soon make and I just wanted to weigh in on that myself. I think one thing that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| keep in mind is the state statute, TCA, which empowers health boards is a convoluted morass of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=428)|
| 0:07:21| ambiguities and contradictions and that's a lot of the reason we have suffered through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| what we have suffered through with deciding who makes policy, how far that policy goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| and how long a policy and emergency lasts. I'd just like to read you the section that empowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=452)|
| 0:07:44| County Boards of Health and this is TCA Title 68 Health Safety Environmental Protection Chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| 2 Local Health Services Part 6 County Health Departments 68-2-601 County Boards of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| Members Powers and Duties and this is under Section F and it is Paragraph 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=477)|
| 0:08:07| Powers and Duties of County Boards of Health are to adopt rules and regulations as may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| necessary or appropriate to protect the general health and safety of the citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| The regulations shall be at least as stringent as a standard established by a state law or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| regulation as applicable to the same or similar subject matter. Regulations of a County Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| Health supersede less stringent or conflicting local ordinances. That is as broad powers as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=510)|
| 0:08:41| will ever see. There is no limitation on what a County Board of Health can do. There is no time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=521)|
| 0:08:48| limit. There are no circumstances under which this only applies. It's all the time. I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| very uncomfortable with any governmental body having this sort of authority and yes one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| is an unelected body. We can say well no we have other unelected committees and boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=545)|
| 0:09:16| but all of them in Knox County in some way answer to you all. None of them work independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=556)|
| 0:09:24| of you. We can also say this is and there's no doubt about it this is a very important situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| and there are experts on the Board of Health. I would like to point out we have experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| on other boards and committees. We listen to experts every day and that's how we form our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| decisions but we are the ones as elected officials who make those decisions and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| what we're supposed to do. So in that regard yes I would be in favor of moving the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| to an advisory role but that doesn't completely remove the problem because if you'll read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| subsection E, in counties which fail to establish an active Board of Health pursuant to subsection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| A, the Commissioner of Health may establish a health advisory committee to function as provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| in 68-2-802. However, the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee retains all powers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=618)|
| 0:10:25| duties of the Board of Health. So you still have, he's the Commissioner I would assume per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| her designee would be Dr. Buchanan would still be making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=632)|
| 0:10:39| Representative Jason Zachary has some legislation at the state that addresses this but even his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=639)|
| 0:10:46| legislation after going through the amendment process is somewhat convoluted. According to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| his legislation the County Mayor would be the person who would declare a public health emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=651)|
| 0:10:57| If that comes to pass I would strongly encourage this body to put severe limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=657)|
| 0:11:06| on the duration that a public health emergency can be called for by the Mayor. Again I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| uncomfortable with any governmental body or authority having this kind of power including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| the Mayor's office. So as we move forward not only I think as we address the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| but also the outcome that comes to the state is something else that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| will be looking at. Thank you for allowing me to speak. Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=691)|
| 0:11:42| Well I was just going to say that the Senate is supposed to take it up this Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| at 1 30 p.m. our time in the Health Welfare Committee. So it's kind of in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| the agenda so it could be a long afternoon. I think as we look back on this and we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| especially what's happened in other parts of the country and realize that we have been under state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| of emergency now for close to a year. At the County level anyway I think that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| that we really need to address. Whether it's if the Mayor declares a public health emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| that can be for however long until the next Commission meeting. But Commission has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| approve an extension. Things like that I think is stuff that you all really need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you so much. Thank you Mayor. I've got a question. Yes sir. Would you be so what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=747)|
| 0:12:37| basically saying is you want us to amend the ordinance to make sure those powers don't last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| for a specific amount longer? Like the specific because I know that in 30 days we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| voting you know because of the 90 day. I think that what's going to happen is the ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| you all are looking at with the Board of Health is different than the state. That's going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| the state ordinance. I think at the County level if possible you all need to put restraints on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| whoever has the ability to declare a public health emergency so that it doesn't ongo for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| months and months and months. Director Booth is that's we've talked about the language before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| being so minute and small that we can do specific things like that in the ordinance. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| something that's so small we could put in the ordinance for that? You can do whatever you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| on that ordinance. I think that and as I understand it Becky Duncan Massey has said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| there's going to be more amendments to what is already before you as it goes to the what committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| is that? Senate Health and Welfare. But this just deals with the way that Zachary's has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=823)|
| 0:13:52| chopped up. It just has to do with if there's an emergency and it puts a big burden on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| mayor to declare you know because right now the Board of Health has ultimate power to do whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=839)|
| 0:14:04| they want anytime they want and that's what the mayor is raising the issue about and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| this body can control that in whatever manner it wants by way of ordinance. Does that answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| your question? Yeah and so given the article that came out today about Dr. Briggs and his feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| on it which we which you know we've kind of watched some. Let me get closer to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| Given the article that came out today about with Dr. Briggs and some of the things he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| would we be able to move that ordinance up now in our actually our next meeting vote on it next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| Wednesday in our voting meeting? You can do whatever you want on this meeting or next meeting. Well the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| next meeting is the voting meeting so but this body can do whatever it wants on that. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| heard of Dr. Briggs analysis and his opinion. I haven't seen it and I didn't read any article but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| so I'm aware of it. Thank you both. Thank you. Commissioner Smith. Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| Mr. Mayor I want to try to clarify what you said. I think and correct me if I have this wrong but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| you're saying that the current current order ordinance that will be before us you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| necessarily directing it on any amendment to it. No. You're saying if the state wants the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| Yes sir. Once the state doesn't go back and yeah you guys you all this body will have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=925)|
| 0:15:34| probably look at the ordinances or I'm sorry the statute that comes out of Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| and make another determination. You know I think we're going to be doing that across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| because as we look back upon this and you know realize that we no one knew the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| had these powers and certainly no one knew that they had them any time and the same with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| mayor's office. You don't want the mayor to just be able to hey we're going to declare a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| health emergency and it just keeps on and on and on and on. There has to be some sort of oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| from this body but it's not what you not what this body's doing what the state is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=966)|
| 0:16:15| Director Boog it's my understanding that in our current ordinance if we were to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| limit Dr. Buchanan's power we would not be able to because of the existing state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| I don't think you can limit Dr. Buchanan's powers because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| she answers directly to the commissioner. She is in essence appointed by the commissioner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| health in Nashville with the approval of the mayor. That's what the statute says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| but no I mean she's got that power and I think everything that's come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| the Board of Health gets all this information from Dr. Buchanan as I gather like the mayor said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| she's got all the experts that's where all the information is. She's got a direct line to CDC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| everybody else so that's where it comes from it would not you're right it would not affect her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| power. Okay and I just wanted to clarify so that we knew that in the future if the state does do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| something we may have to make some ordinance changes but there is no need to change the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| current order for us because we couldn't make that change to it. Agreed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1040)|
| 0:17:30| Dr. Buchanan let me give you a few minutes to give us an update on our new central vaccine clinic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1050)|
| 0:17:39| current state of affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| It's a little tall for me. Martha Buchanan 140 Dameron Avenue. Thank you Mr. Jay for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| opportunity to address this body. So as you know we started operating at the Food City location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| March 12th and things have gone very well there. Commissioner Daley came out and took a tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| and so we're having a great success. The space flows well and our staff is really happy to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| have to move around or find new places to go give second doses so that's helped us a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| We've given a total of 2,391 doses of vaccine since we started. That number will go up. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| kind of are on a reset right now with doing first doses there and then in the future we'll be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| first and second doses so that number should double or or more. And this Friday and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| Saturday we'll actually give over 2,000 doses. We have 900 scheduled for Friday and 1170 scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| for Saturday so making good use of that space. We'll also be moving testing there on Thursdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1127)|
| 0:18:54| and on Thursdays we'll be going out and perhaps doing more community-based events. There's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1134)|
| 0:19:02| some areas of the community some people in the community who aren't going to go to the Food City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and we want to offer those folks opportunities. The other really great news is more providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| are getting onboarded every week. Our allocation of vaccine is going up regularly so we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| that to continue. I heard Dr. Lisa Piercy speak today. She talked about potentially in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| a 30% increase in the number of doses allocated to the state. Now how that trickles down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| county I don't know exactly what that looks like but they anticipate about a 30% increase in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1170)|
| 0:19:37| allocation for the county. So when we look at the county-wide vaccination program which is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1177)|
| 0:19:43| what we need to look at to know where we are as far as protecting our community because we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| not the sole provider of vaccine and I'm very grateful for those community partners, physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| offices, hospitals, and pharmacies who are giving vaccine on a daily basis. We vaccinated approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1193)|
| 0:20:01| 1,600 sorry 165,758 people have their first dose at least. So that's over 20% of our population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1201)|
| 0:20:11| about 22% of our population has at least one dose and then fully completed the full series either a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| dose of Johnson & Johnson or two doses of Moderna or Pfizer that's over 60,000 people. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| really great moving forward. I'm really excited to be able to talk about these numbers. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| County continues to lead the state in getting our population vaccinated and I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| believe that's because of our partnership with all these community providers because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| putting vaccine out there in places where people go makes it easier for them to get the vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| and so trying to take down those barriers and I know we have Kroger's vaccinating, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| Food City vaccinating, we have Walmart vaccinating, I think Publix is coming online soon, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| independent, several private practices are vaccinating, some smaller pharmacies are vaccinating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| we're vaccinating, our hospitals continue to do their programs, so lots of options for where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| people can get vaccinated. The best source if your constituents call and ask about vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| the best source for them is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| yep, covidvaccine.org, sorry, covidvaccine.org, it's the federal website, has the most accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| information, will take you to the links to the other pages of the people who are doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| vaccinating but can help you see where you might be able to get vaccine, so that's the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| helpful place to send them. Any questions, concerns? Commissioner Daley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1300)|
| 0:21:48| Dr. B, I went out and what a smooth operation that is and I know, I can understand why you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| you don't have to break down, set up, break down, set up. It was a smooth operation and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| thank all the volunteers that were there. I want to make this comment and then I want you to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| up on something. These local pharmacies and even you had made the statement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| once you get on this list and you get your vaccine at another county or another site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| please call and get off that list because you're you're tying up time for people to try to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| and schedule these and I think you had what 50 that day that you were trying to fill in because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| maybe, I know the little other area pharmacies, they're looking for people because they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| show up and they're calling and trying to say, hey, come on, so if you're on the list and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| get used to the vaccine, get off that list. Second thing and one I really want to comment about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| I don't want you and I to discuss about the Johnson & Johnson and that you will take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| Johnson & Johnson but you would prefer the other two because the Johnson & Johnson's are the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| shots that should be going to doctor's offices and clinics, is that correct? Well, yeah, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| really a preference, it's really what we can manage. So public health and hospitals really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| can manage Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine a little more easily than doctor's offices and it's easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| for a doctor's office to bring you in one appointment and get your vaccine, you're done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| you don't have to come back. We also are looking at some partners to use that those vaccinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1399)|
| 0:23:25| which are very effective, they're about 60% effective in preventing disease but they're 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1405)|
| 0:23:31| effective in preventing severe illness or hospitalization and so another population we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| going to be using that in would be our, we're working with a community pharmacy to vaccinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| homebound folks so they can go to the home, give the vaccine, wait the needed amount of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| they don't have to go back for that second dose but that protects that person from severe disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| or hospitalization and really reduces the risk of getting disease. So some of those one-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| opportunities, we've got some employers who are wanting to get their staff vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| so for an employer it's kind of an efficiency thing, you know, if we can work with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| pharmacies or other providers to be able to go and vaccinate that population for that employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| their employees are protected and they don't have to go back and do it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| doesn't disrupt operations as much, they're able to keep their employees at work, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| it has really niche uses. I know our private practice doctors are really, they really want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| that vaccine because it's hard to get people back in two weeks to get another vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| it's just the no-show rate in a private office for that second dose and even at our clinics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| it happens, so that one dose is kind of nice. Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Thank you, Chairman Jane. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan, for all that you've been doing. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| just wondering about the reach out to the minority community, especially the black community and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Latino community. Are you, what other efforts going on? Yeah, so we're working very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| with our Latino community and our African-American community in several different ways. We got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| funding from the state to increase minority outreach and what we did is we created some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| mini-grants, small amounts of money for folks to create educational campaigns and put them out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1511)|
| 0:25:20| ways that those communities consume information. So they don't necessarily consume information in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| the newspaper or mainstream media, it's different social media feeds that I've never even heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| and different ways to get that information out, but they're also tailoring that message in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| that's culturally appropriate so folks will understand that. I think we've also seen in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| African-American community word of mouth has been really important, getting some leaders in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| community vaccinated so they can then say, I got vaccinated, you should too, everything went fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| so we're doing that. We're also working with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| black church, I don't know what they call themselves, there's a group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1560)|

| 0:26:05| The faith leaders initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Yes, faith leaders initiative to outreach specifically to those communities. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| people on our staff who are dedicated to working specifically with our minority communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| and outreaching to them and helping create these videos and we're actually also targeting some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| our communities with older minorities to have some of the specialized pods that are kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1587)|
| 0:26:35| just for there in that community. That's why we're kind of saving Thursdays to be in different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| communities so we can be there. In addition to that, honestly, UT hospital has really taken on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| the initiative of vaccinating our minority community and I really applaud their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| They are organizing with us to be in those communities and get folks vaccinated at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| events, so being very intentional. If you have any ideas, certainly share them with us. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| increasing vaccine uptake among those who are vaccine hesitant has to be targeted and directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| and has to meet them where they are in order to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1637)|
| 0:27:17| With the 55 and older being opened up by the state today, Dr. Buchanan, I wanted to let you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| know that I went and signed up on the wait list at the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| and I encourage everybody that can be vaccinated to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| And I wanted to go back, Carson really stole my thunder, the wait list. It's very important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| if you find a shot that's at a better time or more convenient to you, that you call back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1656)|
| 0:27:42| take your name off. The health department is wasting a lot of people power in their scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| process. Just do everybody a favor, if you get a shot or get one that's more convenient, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| call the health department and take your name off the list. Thank you for bringing that up, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| Yeah, so that number is 215-5555. That's the best number to call to get yourself taken off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| wait list. Last week, we had been averaging about 14% of those we reached out to on the wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1686)|
| 0:28:15| So these are people who said, I want a vaccine. Only about 14% of those folks were getting an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| appointment. And it's either because they got a vaccine somewhere else, they accidentally signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| themselves up a couple of times, the system allowed for that, which is not necessarily great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| On Friday, for whatever reason, it went up to like 25%. I don't know if that's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| sustainable. That's going to continue. But at this time, I actually do have some wait list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| information that I forgot to share with you. At this time, we have about 7,966 individuals on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| wait list who haven't been offered an opportunity to get vaccinated. Dr. Buchanan, on a time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| that's 7,000, what, 10 days, two weeks? To what? Wait time. Wait time. Well, it depends on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| the return rate is. If the return rate is 14%, it's going to be a lot faster. If the return rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| is 25%, it'll be a little slower. So that's the current rate that you're administering doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| Right. If they just get vaccinated by us, we're doing, right currently, we're doing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| 15,000, not 15,000, 1,500 to 1,600 first doses each week at the Food City location. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| you know, based on the, depending on the return rate, again, I can't predict that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| The return rate's been terrible. So, you know, 25%, even 25% of that population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| I can't do that math in my head. Somebody might use their phone. What are you doing with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| return no-show doses on that day since they are already scheduled? So they're not scheduled. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| our no-show rate for first doses is really low. It's very, very low. It's no-show rate for second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| doses that's a little higher. So these 7,966 people haven't been offered an opportunity. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| we are texting and reaching out to about 3,500 people at a shot to get them to schedule an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1803)|
| 0:30:12| appointment. So they have a four-hour window to reach back out, schedule their appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| And so if they can't reach back out, they can also call us. So people who said they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| a cell phone, we have a way to call them. So they're being called as well. So we do that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| least twice a day. We send out this mass text and actually I got my father vaccinated. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| how I did it. I signed him up and I got the text and was able to schedule the appointment for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| So that's what we're doing. And so we're sending out about 7,000 or more texts a day to fill three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1839)|
| 0:30:46| or four or 500 slots for vaccines. So it is a very, right now, a very labor-intense process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| We are hoping to move to something less labor-intense in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| But right now, it continues to be pretty labor-intense. But we're happy to do it. We just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| want to get people vaccinated. And, you know, we'll call, we'll text, we'll do what we need to do. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| do your part. If you've gotten vaccinated, just let us know. It's fine. We'll take you off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| list. Freeze up some time and space for somebody else. And I know it's hard to believe I'm over 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| I was surprised by that, Randy. Dr. McKinnon, is there not a technological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| way for us in the software to have a way for somebody to go and say, remove me from the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1883)|
| 0:31:28| click, and do that on their own without having to call and sit on hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| Our current system does not allow for that. So that's a, again, new solutions coming soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| we hope, that won't require so much work on the back end. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| I just wanted to know if we had any data on how many teachers have been vaccinated so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| percentage, or how are we doing in that category? So that's a great question for our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| or for the employers of those teachers. We don't track vaccination by discipline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| but employers probably do. I don't know if the schools will know that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| What I can tell you is that our hospital partners were integral in helping us get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| people vaccinated. Children's Hospital, in particular, worked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| the Knox County Schools list. I believe they've gone through that whole list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| and everyone's been offered the opportunity to get vaccinated. I don't know what the uptake was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| And then our other hospitals also worked with some of the private schools and child care facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| to help get them vaccinated as well. And I believe we've worked through all of those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| and everybody's been offered an opportunity, whether they took it or they got vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| or just decided not to get vaccinated. I don't have that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Commissioner Garrett? Thank you, Mr. Chair. When you were talking with Commissioner Lundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| about coming to the community to help specifically with the minority community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| what locations are you specifically looking for when you say you're coming to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Well, actually, we ask the community, where's the place to go? Because we don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| And so we follow their lead and look at places where we know that they will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| The other thing that we do specifically for minority population is we set up clinics so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| that we have enough interpreters there to help make the flow go more easily and get them through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| So we really are working very closely with those grassroots groups that are serving those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| populations to say, hey, where's a place that we would get some uptake? And so because we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2009)|
| 0:33:36| necessarily always know that. Do you have any ideas? Because I mean, I'm happy to take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| But my initial thought would be schools. And well, yeah, the problem with schools is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2021)|
| 0:33:49| people are there. Right. Maybe on a Saturday. I don't know if it's possible. I mean, that's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| a thought. It is possible, certainly possible. And we've talked about doing some Saturday school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| locations. We certainly have plans to use schools for vaccination clinics. Our original pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| plan has tons of school maps and stuff in it. So we know the ones that are best. So we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| continue to look at Saturday opportunities and consider that. But again, working with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| minority communities to help understand the best places to go. I think schools are a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2060)|
| 0:34:30| Commissioner Bussing. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Dr. Buchanan, is there any way that we know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| percentage of Knox County citizens have been vaccinated so far? Well, that's the number I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2076)|
| 0:34:43| shared with you earlier today, Commissioner, this evening. So 22.6 percent of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| citizens have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and 6,040 have completed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2089)|
| 0:34:58| series. And I didn't do that math and can't do that math in my head, at least not in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| So that's that's those are just Knox County citizens. They may or may not have been vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| in Knox County, but those are Knox County citizens who got vaccinated because that's how vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| data is reported back to us from the state registry. So all the other counties that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| around us right now, if they're vaccinating Knox County citizens or in the past, that's inside your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| data? It is inside my data. Yes, sir. So if you live in Knox County and you have been vaccinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| and whoever vaccinated you reported to the system, which they have to do within 72 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| then you're counted in this number. Thank you. I'm not seeing any other questions. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2136)|
| 0:35:44| the update, Dr. Buchanan. Thank you. One note on the agenda, and I'll look to the body to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2144)|
| 0:35:52| you want to pull it off with consent. 32 was not pulled, but that had an amended agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| was emailed to us about three thirty or four o'clock. I'll look around and see if anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| wants to pull that, discuss that based on the new amendment, and we can pull that out. We can vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2167)|

| 0:48:38| why Mr. Snowden and I and engineering decided that we'd just rather close it than make it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| safety hazard. Thank you. Thank you for that, Commissioner Daley. I appreciate it. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| for all your hard work. Commissioner, Mr. Snowden, before you pick up, could you just provide us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2927)|
| 0:48:55| little context on was this a high accident area or is this something we had planned on doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2935)|

| 0:49:34| for the right opportunity to do this, and with that corner being developed, it just makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| to do that. There has been a crash problem there. The crashes that do occur there are severe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| injury just because of the speed along Chapman Highway, and as Commissioner Daley said, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=2984)|

| 0:52:33| that with this conversation since it's on the same topic? I was waiting until it came up on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| agenda, but I guess we can look at it now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, by the way. Assuming it is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| school, the same topic, I'm sorry. It is the same topic. There's some more money there that I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| wondering why some of these new amendments were made for the uses of money and how it could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3175)|
| 0:53:03| used. Can you not hear? No, it's better now. Thank you. I was just going to have the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3183)|
| 0:53:13| to just give me a little bit of information. There was two new amendments that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| there. Two of the new $50 million came from the state, and that's what I wanted to talk to last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| month, but we didn't have a chance to do so. It has to do with addressing learning loss and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| the money was going to be used at that, and it said school facilities repair and improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| which it looks like on this amendment you could build a new school with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| So, I just want to know what all uses that you could do with these two new amendments that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| not on the original one when we had the $50 million here. If you would please state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| name and address or department for the record, please. Yes, thank you, Commissioner. Ron McPherson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Knox County Schools. Yes, Mr. Bussler, we've had quite a bit of discussion actually amongst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3236)|
| 0:54:03| staff and amongst the board. There were two new provisions. One was to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| learning gaps. One was to potentially address infrastructure. So, the learning gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3248)|
| 0:54:19| as we're crafting the general purpose budget, we are addressing those within the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| budget because those are presumably ongoing needs that we will have to address those as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3264)|
| 0:54:34| The infrastructure, we can use for infrastructure, but I would caution that with regards to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| funds, there has to be a way that it relates in some way to the pandemic's disruption. It can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| relate to infrastructure. Obviously, it would have to be approved by the state. We do have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| infrastructure needs built into the request, and I think it would be disclosed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| backup information that you all have received. And it does address air quality. It addresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| potential additional space to accommodate overcrowding issues to create additional space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| or additions at other schools. So, again, that has to be approved by the state, but we have taken a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| look at that. Yeah, the reason why I was asking that, you talk about infrastructure, since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| doing the social distancing, now that they say that it's not six feet, but it's three feet for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| students, that you could use some of this money to enlarge the schools to meet those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3333)|
| 0:55:41| which was not done in the first monies that we got last year. That's right. So, the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| amount was significantly less, although it was a good amount. It was just shy of 13 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| We used that primarily for reimbursement for personnel, for teachers that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3353)|
| 0:56:02| taught virtually. So, when the stay-at-home order from the governor came down in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| I think about a year ago, so essentially from March to the end of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| students were not in school, but learning continued. We applied to get reimbursement for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| that, and we were granted that. The majority of those funds, seven million dollars, we went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| purchase phase one of our one-to-one initiative, which puts a new, the intent is to put a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| device into the hands of every student, a Chromebook. Seven million certainly doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| cover the entire district, but it was enough to at least make sure all the kids had a device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| And I shudder to think if we had not been able to do that, how we could have had school this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| because we had 19,000 students that opted for virtual learning in the first semester and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| shy of 15,000 for the second semester. So, those funds definitely came along at a good time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| enabled us to be able to do that. On the learning initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3421)|
| 0:57:09| are we going to address some of the issues that we found that we had problems with in the school of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| you know, the virtual schools? And I've heard that there's quite a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| Are we going to change the platforms on how we? So, here's what we, here's, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| So, here's what we found out. Obviously, the virtual learning, that was new for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| right? But it was such a big ordeal that essentially what we found out is we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| 38,000 kids in in-person, 19,000 kids virtual in the first semester. Those were, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3457)|
| 0:57:45| that made us operating two large school systems, two of the largest in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| And so, obviously, there's a learning curve there. I think in line of everything that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| encountered, we, it probably exceeded some of our expectations because, I mean, we had to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| to that pretty quickly and make that work. There are improvements that need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3481)|
| 0:58:06| and we've addressed that in ESSER 2.0. Because what we would like to do is put more of a focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3486)|
| 0:58:14| on virtual learning to where we can give it better due diligence. Because what we were finding out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| we had to do this so quick, we had a considerable number of teachers that were essentially teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| on their planning period. And so, there was a lot of what we call asynchronous learning taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| place. It wasn't necessarily live instruction. What we would like to do is to place more of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3510)|
| 0:58:36| a focus on that so that we could be more effective with that, so we can have more synchronous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| learning. And that would involve, that would involve monies to be able to get that tended to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| So, yes, I guess the short answer is yes. So, you're going to more live broadcast instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| pre-recorded. Yes, sir. Okay. Have you ever thought about, again, I'll mention this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3535)|
| 0:59:01| we have PNVA that was started up here in Union County that takes care of the whole state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3541)|
| 0:59:07| Tennessee Virtual Learning Academy, and they have like screens on their computers that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| interact with the teacher, and the teacher covers large areas of different students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| And we did. We have looked at that. And to be honest, we, how do I say this? To be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3558)|
| 0:59:27| we think that there are more effective ways, right, than what has been done in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3567)|
| 0:59:36| area. So, there were some concerns that we had if we tried to kind of tag team off the back of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3576)|
| 0:59:45| so to speak. So, you know, again, it's not trying to, don't want to disrespect any particular type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| of what other districts are learning that may be going on out there, but we just had several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| concerns, and I won't get into that right now. So, we'll be lined up for next year, whatever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| have coming, you'll have all these things set in place to where we can start off running at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| ready pace. Yes, that's the plan, right, because when all this hit, you know, we were right in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| middle of the budget development, and then COVID hit, and it kind of just like put everything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| a screeching halt. And then there was massive amount of work at each school to revise schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3619)|
| 1:00:27| because once the virtual learning option, we offered that, which we had to, I mean, we felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3627)|
| 1:00:34| like we had to, then that kind of disrupted all of the work that had been going on with regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| to scheduling and so forth. So, that kind of just had to shelve all of that and start over and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| that tended to before school started. So, yeah, that was, we were kind of going, you know, 90 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| an hour on that. So, the second part of that amendment here has to do with the social distancing too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| because you said you had 35,000 students and 19,000. 38 to 19, that was semester one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3658)|
| 1:01:08| Yeah, the ratio between that and spacing distance inside the classroom could have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3668)|
| 1:01:15| quite a bit of a problem, and so you're going to address that also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| Right, we've taken everything into account, and so we feel like this is the most strategic use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| the money. So, with the ESSER 2.0, one thing we have to understand is that we can't just use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| money to just drop it into the regular budget, right? So, we can't say, hey, we have some operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| needs, we have a budget gap, so let's just take this, drop it into the budget, and we'll be ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| These initiatives must be tied to, in some ways, the pandemic, right? And so these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| the feds will be very careful to take a look at districts to make sure districts have spent these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| accordingly. They will be audited, obviously, very closely. It has to be approved by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| and so there are some very definite requirements on how we can spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3718)|
| 1:02:03| Thank you. Commissioner Dillard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ron, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| Your attachment is very informative. I appreciate that. I see where Adrian Burnett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3728)|
| 1:02:14| and where Rick McLeod and Rich Dale and Austin East are getting HV upgrades and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| which is fantastic. But really what, and you just mentioned number nine, let me pull down number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| nine. Number nine is $6,510,978, and it is allowable, indirect costs remitted to general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3746)|
| 1:02:37| purpose provides financial stability and flexibility. Is this part of the PPE supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| that we're going to be having to pay for? And that way, if we pay for it through this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| we don't have to pay it out of our general fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| Potentially. So there, what we're trying to do in partner with the county is to try to claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| some of those costs through FEMA. So we try to do that, and the county's very helpful in running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| interference for that, speaking up on our behalf. It didn't work so well for the first round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3785)|
| 1:03:14| There's a chance that we could get reimbursement through FEMA. So if so, we didn't want to then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| claim reimbursement through ESSER if we leave money on the table through, obviously, through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| FEMA. So this would be a way to, once we get it into, we can claim indirect costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| Then if it doesn't work through FEMA, then we can then utilize the dollars to then take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3813)|
| 1:03:43| This, I was on two calls last week with NACO, listening to the White House and their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3823)|
| 1:03:51| and everything, which right now they don't have a plan. They're still waiting for that plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| happen. But we're talking a lot of money's coming down. We're talking Knox County is about $92| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| million. That's right. Schools are going to be about $120 million. $114 million. City of Knoxville, $45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| million. Town of Farragut, $10, $15 million. We're talking a lot of money, and we got to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| and I'll go ahead and bring it up now. I would love to see a committee form that we got to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3853)|
| 1:04:21| sure that we're not, we use these funds first before we use our general funds, and where these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| funds are going. I know we can't tell the schools that, but we can tell the $92 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Us 11 can tell where that $92 million is going. $46 million of that is going to be within our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| bank account in 60 days. Right. No, that's a great, we're having the exact same conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| across the street, I can tell you. So the one thing we wanted to be real careful about, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| which I think we've done a pretty good job, is we wanted to leverage these dollars against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3890)|
| 1:04:54| general purpose fund. So these dollars, while directly they do not provide relief to the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| purpose budget, what these dollars can do is pay for initiatives that otherwise we might have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3901)|
| 1:05:08| put into the general fund, like virtual learning and some of these other things. So we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| be very strategic. We used these dollars, and so we didn't want to leave any money on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| but it does provide some breathing room. Budgets are never easy, right? But we're actually pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3918)|
| 1:05:28| encouraged about this upcoming budget for, number one, because sales tax continues to trend very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| positively. That gives us a higher ceiling going into next year to budget. That would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| And these are initiatives that, had ESSER funding not become available, we would be grappling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| with the general purpose budget and trying to determine an alternate funding stream for some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| of these other items that we would have to do, like the one-to-one initiative, virtual learning. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| even use textbooks to fund through this. Typically that's come out of fund balance reserves. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| indirectly does help general purpose, and we're going to use the same approach for ESSER 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3962)|
| 1:06:09| So the good thing is, we're not required to spend all of these dollars in year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| So we'll have to 2023 for ESSER 2.0. Originally we heard we would have till 2023 for 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3974)|
| 1:06:22| Now I've seen some information that says it may be 2024. That would be even better. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| this is a multi-year approach. So obviously, with the ESSER dollars, we would obviously work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| with the board. In any of those discussions, I would encourage commissioners for 3.0, when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| shows up on the agenda. Certainly I would encourage commissioners to look in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| because there's some pretty healthy discussion that goes on with those. And so the thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| process that we use to draft that proposal, we would also bring it back here to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| just like we've done this, to show our plans. So yeah, there are some creative ways. The state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| has been really good to work with. But again, there has to be a rational reason. There has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4025)|
| 1:07:13| be a justification in how we spend these funds. So the state's pretty strict about it, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| feds are definitely strict about it. You know, I see $92 million is a lot of money. Okay, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4038)|
| 1:07:27| going to get $46 million. But the way they've got it narrowed down to where we can only do sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| water, broadband, basically no transportation, because we're not in mass transit in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| or the airport. We're so far narrowed down that, and I bet you we're not going to be the only one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| these other counties throughout the United States is going to be the same way. And then the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| half comes down, they're going to loosen it up more, in my opinion. I think they'll loosen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| up more to where we could use it for capital projects. I hope they do, because there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4075)|
| 1:08:03| some capital projects that we need to do. That's right. Preliminary, so the preliminary reports we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| get, and we've kind of run this up the flagpole for the state, is it seems very encouraging that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| we can use these for capital projects. I just think it, you know, you can't just say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| this project's on our capital plan, we'd like to do this. You know, there has to be a rationale with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| the state and a justification on why you do certain things or why you're utilizing these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| dollars for that. So we're very encouraged that we can do that. I can tell you that with ESSER 2.0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| there were two additional, I think Commissioner Bussler may have mentioned this, two additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| initiatives that were allowed. That's infrastructure, that's addressing learning gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| For ESSER 3.0, I'm not sure there could be, I'm not predicting it because I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| there could be additional lineups on there like you're talking about. So we'll just have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| and see until we get more information. Commissioner Biggs asked you to ask this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4133)|
| 1:09:01| and Mr. Caldwell, this 42 or this 46 million dollars, this money, this 51 that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| we parked it in a bank somewhere. We're drawing interest off of that 50 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| until it's spent, correct? We haven't received the 50 million yet. We have to apply for those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| and the application, we sent the application in, we will bring that back to the board. We had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| discussion with the board, this was our recommendation, and the board approved receipt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| of those funds, which is what the commission is doing. We will bring the application though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| once the application is approved, then the funds will become available. So they haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| dropped 50 million in our coffers yet. Chris, you're hiding down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| Chris, if you say we've got 50 million dollars in the account I didn't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Well, let's put it this way. I learned last week on two different conference calls that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| we should have 46 million parked in a bank in Knox County somewhere in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| Now I understand, Chris, it goes to the state and the state will divide it, will send it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| the counties. Is that correct? No, it won't go to the state, it'll come straight to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| And so we will get an allocation of approximately 46 million by May the 12th, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| And so once that money comes, that is approximately half of our total. I think the other half comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| like a year later. And so, you know, we keep searching for guidance. We talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| today at the audit committee. What is that guidance and what should we do? We got some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| guidance from the comptroller's office that no expenditure should be made before you are certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4239)|
| 1:10:47| that the use of the funds comply with the provisions of the act, which are good. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| recommend these funds be used for one-time expenses. So you'll hear me say a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| one-time money, one-time expenses. So I don't think we should use these funds for recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| expenses. These funds cannot be deposited in a pension fund or be used to offset revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| resulting in a tax cut. Funds may be used as replacement revenue. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4272)|
| 1:11:22| here's going to be the three key components that we've heard thus far and hopefully getting more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| One, it's expenses related to COVID that's had an economic impact on your county. That can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| fairly broad, but we'll have to figure out what that truly means. Two is loss of revenue. For us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| that's court revenue and motel tax for sure. Three is, and you said this, sewer, water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4301)|
| 1:11:52| and broadband infrastructure. I have submitted the question to NACO, which submitted it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4312)|
| 1:12:01| the U.S. Treasury, does this include road and bridge infrastructure? We've not got that response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4321)|
| 1:12:09| back yet. And so my recommendation, and I told this to the mayor, and I would say this to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| all, once we get this money in our bank account, we set it aside in a separate account. And until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| we get guidance, we sit there. Because if we don't spend it appropriately, it has to be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| I think we can easily look at revenue shortfall, and those are easy. But until we get guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| from U.S. Treasury, I think that we stay put until we can figure out what we need to spend this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4360)|
| 1:12:47| on. Agree. Commissioner Skinmaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Now we're back to the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| So, we don't have the money, but you could, once all the paperwork's completed, you could expect it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| when? Well, I'll probably need to check with our federal programs director on that. I think pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| quickly. Certainly before the fiscal year has ended. Okay, great. And then two more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| The comment came up that you're going to spend almost $11 million on textbooks, but you've just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4395)|
| 1:13:23| spent a bunch of money on Chromebooks. Yeah. Why would you need to go back to the old school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| textbooks? Well, so, no, that's a great question. We've had that before. So, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4408)|
| 1:13:37| so when you have Chromebook, so the content is what the content is. But if that's, even when that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4417)|
| 1:13:44| is through, I don't want to say that, through the internet or through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4424)|
| 1:13:53| I guess, through their computer, they can look at the content. We haven't really noticed there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| any, the cost is what the cost is. I don't know, John, that's what we're hearing. So, you can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| just because you have a computer, you can, maybe certainly you can kind of move away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| from textbooks in some fashion, but the content is you've just got to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| And what we have encountered is really no less than what the books are themselves. John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| I don't know if you're hearing that too. That's a great question. In fact, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| we thought, hey, if we go to one-to-one, we can pay for that through the elimination of textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| And that was kind of a mindset we had at the time. So, hey, it wouldn't really cost that much. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| what we found out is that's actually not. You're, the cost is the license, the content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| whether it comes in electronic form or book form. Yeah, that's right. Because the work has been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| to assemble all of that content from various sources, and so then they charge for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Okay. And then do we typically spend a half a million dollars for summer school transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4493)|
| 1:15:01| Well, this is for, so with the summer school, so the summer school transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| these are costs that are not covered by the summer school grant from the new legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| that came down. So, there's dollars in the grant to have summer school. There were no dollars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| the grant to get the kids there. So, we thought, okay, since that's not in the budget, this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| be an opportunity to tap into ESTRA to make that happen. Okay, because normally it's parents are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| responsible for getting their child for summer school. Is that typically what's happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| Right. But, you know, with our student population that, you know, would likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| benefit the most from summer school, that's not always a good option for parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| Okay. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| Thank you. Mr. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair, I'm going to go off agenda here a second. Ron, I've said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| this before, but now that you have the superintendent and the executive staff with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| you, I again want to state how proud I am of what Knox County's education system has done in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4560)|
| 1:16:07| hard times. I appreciate that. And I look around the country and see the struggles that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| districts are having. You know, this hasn't been easy. It hasn't been pretty, but you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| done a fabulous job and you're really appreciated. That's very kind of you to mention that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| appreciate that. I second that. Thanks. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Thank you. Director Caldwell, I got a question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| Kind of going off of what Commissioner Daly was talking, where you said expenses related to COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| or a loss of revenue. Point of order. Just a minute, Mr. Chairman. Could we maybe add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| as a discussion item for next week since this is not on the agenda that what he's getting ready to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| We can do it at budget discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| You know, do we, would that, my esteemed colleague from South Knoxville, would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| we be better to do it as a, would you like to add that as a discussion item for next week's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| I would ask Justin if he would hold it till budget discussions. If you can ask at budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| discussions. It's a pretty simple question. I don't think it needs a whole lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Okay. So, would this, that we were talking about include what we voted on last month for the $1.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4634)|
| 1:17:23| million for the new facility at the Sheriff's office? This would compensate for that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| correct? I think it's very possible that that expense is allowable under our federal money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4648)|
| 1:17:34| that we get. We want to get guidance for that before we do it, but I do think it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| Thank you. Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4658)|
| 1:17:47| I've got the figures for every county in the state of Tennessee, and it looks like it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| there's some disparity between some of the funds going to other counties and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| How did they, is there a formula that they used to do that? Because I noticed there was $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| million difference between Shelby County and Davidson County. Shelby got the $200 and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| million in, Davidson got about $100. It essentially boils down to what the state did is they looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| at the Title I population of each individual district, did it on a per-pupil basis and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| allocated it that way. Now, that's not to say that all of these funds must be spent that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| specifically and only specifically on Title I students. That's just the funding allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| Okay. Thank you. Seeing no further discussion on this, we have a motion to approve, which will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| put it on the education consent calendar from Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4716)|

| 1:19:02| It's resolution 208, authorizing the acceptance of grant funds for the Knox County schools as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| shown on the attached list and in the total amount of $28,288. Commissioner Daley, you pulled that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| I did. Motion to approve. Motion to approve by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4753)|

| 1:19:24| the $28,000 going into CTE programs. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4764)|

| 1:20:14| Seconded by, I didn't hear who that was. Commissioner Smith? Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| I'm all Mr. Russ. You started moving, but then you just quit. Uh-oh, he's limping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4820)|
| 1:20:28| Been there, done that. Still doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4828)|
| 1:20:36| I guess the question will be, but you're going to, you know, give us a summary of what these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| contracts are for, probably installation of playground equipment or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| There's only how many playground equipment people in the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4845)|
| 1:20:50| I don't know how many playground equipment people are in the country, but we've got three vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| here. Now, they may pull from only two suppliers. I'm not sure. I don't know that. But this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4855)|
| 1:21:03| basically a term contract and it's replacing our term contract that is lapsing that we've had in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| place for the last five years. It is for design and installation of playground equipment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| playgrounds as well as providing ground cover for us, the engineered wood fiber. And we buy off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4879)|
| 1:21:29| this contract and our policy that we put in place four or five years ago requires anybody who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| to donate or to buy playground equipment like PTAs or foundations or whatever to buy off of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| contracts. So that way, we ultimately become the buyer. The Knox County Schools becomes the buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| So when there is a recall or an update or some issue with a piece of equipment that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| procured, we'll get the notification as opposed to someone who may no longer be connected with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| project. I've already been through two playgrounds and going through two more this year, raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| $65,000 for playground equipment, which is very, very expensive. Is there a possibility that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| could look at these funds coming up to buy playground equipment since we've got all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| kids stuffed in this one room and they need to be out playing some? I don't know. That's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4943)|

| 1:22:35| You know, most of the playground procurement comes through PTAs and school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| foundations and school fundraisers. But that's something we can certainly look at. Yeah, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| hard for my schools that are the, right now we've got, anybody wants to donate, we're happy to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=4965)|

| 1:23:46| 15 minutes. So that would put us back here, well, let's call it 625, 640 we'll return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5026)|

| 1:25:34| discussion. I just have a few items to present to frame the conversation. The merit system and its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5134)|

| 1:26:51| and paired it with suggestions from our law director into a modernized, revised ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| for your review and consideration. If passed, these reforms will ultimately help with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5215)|

| 1:27:10| transparency, and accountability by all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| You've been presented a packet. That same packet is posted online. I want to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| by doing two things. One, just quickly walking through this timeline. This should be at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| very top of your packet. It's a bit of a flow chart. And then, because we skipped over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5244)|
| 1:27:31| spread of record, which is part of this, I'm going to stop at that point and just talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| about the recommendations. So, walking through, just again, the timeline of how we got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| today. In September of this past year, the special committee was formed and committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| members were invited to participate in four meetings, October 10th, November 10th, December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| 1st, and January 14th. From the work of that committee, included in your packet are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| minutes from all of those four meetings. We basically ended up with two different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| We ended up with some proposed reforms to the actual ordinance, and then we ended up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| with recommendations to both parties of the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5287)|
| 1:28:13| System Council. Now, the recommendations were also listed today that's in your packet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5293)|
| 1:28:21| recommendations that were part of spread of record. When we started this work, made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| very clear to all the committee members that we were going to end up with two things. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| thing was related to the ordinance, but there were going to be things that came up through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| the conversations that were not under the purview of county commission, or that were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| part of our role and responsibility as the governing body. That is what came of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| recommendations. You have a sheet in here, and again, it's part of our spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| These are things that essentially came out of the discovery, and I think need to be said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| and need to be put on record, but are not things that we can control. You can read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| those. Those include officer compensation, recruitment, promotion and transfers, communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| human resource modernization, feedback and officer surveys, and engagement with county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| commission. These are suggestions, and these are recommendations. The parties, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| it be the sheriff, the sheriff's office administration, the merit council, or others, I hope that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5356)|
| 1:29:22| they will take those to heart, and I hope that they will address those, but again, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| is not under the purview of county commission. They just are things that were discovered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| through the process, so that is the spread of record. Those are the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| After finishing our work in the special committee, I sat down and met with both parties to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5375)|
| 1:29:42| them the preview of these items, both the reforms and the recommendations. Those dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| are listed there, and then sat down and worked with the law department over several meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| in February and March to begin taking the work of the special committee and turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| it into the ordinances before you today for first consideration. As you can see, the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| will go on and be considered, we hope, and then what you are looking at today is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5403)|
| 1:30:10| ordinance as combined between the special committee and the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| Also in your packet, I just want to point out, there are two memos from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| This actually came from our current law director when he was the chief deputy, but the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| memo in your packet outlines the authority of the Knox County Commission as the governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| body for the merit council, and that outlines that very clearly. The second memo came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| Mr. Myers-Morton, who was very involved in the process, that essentially talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| one of the reform items, which is an open meetings law and the transparency of proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5448)|
| 1:30:55| Those are in there. In your very top packet, or top part of this process and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5455)|
| 1:31:03| item is the analysis that I put in together. That was Director Buch and I wrote this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| combined our thoughts into how we got to today. That is a recap of what I just shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| with you, and it brings out some discussions and breaks into things of what came out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5473)|
| 1:31:18| the special committee versus what came out of the law department. All of that to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| a lot of work has gone into today. This is our first chance to have a discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| it and first opportunity to really dig into the ordinance. I'm happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5488)|
| 1:31:34| open up the discussion, or yield the floor to any other conversation to begin us this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5494)|

| 1:31:54| I'm just going to be honest. I was under the impression that whatever would come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| the committee and be ordinance changes would have been voted on in said committee. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| we discussed a lot of things. With those, I just assumed that would be as per the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| the committee was formed to begin with, was to build the relationship between the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| Office and the Merit System Council. I was of the understanding that the discussion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5543)|
| 1:32:31| we had were merely suggestions for those two entities to discuss among themselves. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5551)|
| 1:32:39| only thing we voted on was to change hiring processes and it was voted down. With all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5559)|
| 1:32:51| of these changes, I think there should be more discussion. I would like to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5571)|
| 1:32:59| an AmeriCorps system representative. Just out of curiosity, how much time have you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5579)|
| 1:33:07| to review this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| If you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| Paula Taylor, 912 Southgate Street. I believe I probably received them the same day that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| the commissioners received those. As far as enough time, absolutely not because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| are so many changes in there and I would have to disagree with Commissioner Jay that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| they do affect many things as well as there will be issues that changes the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5610)|
| 1:33:43| As somebody who is fairly new to this process, these are ordinance changes. What is the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| between an ordinance change and say a change to your policy and procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| Obviously the ordinance changes the law. Our rules are the policies and procedures that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| are structured by the ordinance changes. A rule change can be made by the council as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5640)|
| 1:34:09| long as it follows the ordinance. Obviously that is also in this change as well that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5649)|
| 1:34:17| council would not be able to do that any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| Currently with any kind of ordinance change that the council would like to make, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| have to have a public meeting, discuss that in public, vote on that in public before it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| can be brought to commission. With this, we had no idea. I had asked for the changes several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| times from the law director's office. In fact, Myers Morton told me he had it completed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| late February, but he could not give it to me until Larson said so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| A question I have also, I mean I can get, I have some questions with the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5687)|
| 1:34:57| Can I address the two things before, is that okay? Everybody on the committee, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| all the commissioners, were sent this ordinance on March 11th, a little over two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5704)|
| 1:35:13| And they were completed on the morning of March 11th. We were doing revisions. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| note the timeline and all of the meetings I had with the law department, and you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| ask Director Buch, we literally were working on them in February, again in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| of March, middle of March, the 3rd, the 9th, and all the way up to the morning of the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| And they were sent to all members of this commission and to the committee on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5734)|
| 1:35:40| Just to go back to the original point that you had made, I was very clear throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| the entire process from the very beginning of what two things would come out of the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| committee. And the minutes reflect, whenever we had, the entire committee had a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| on an item. Let's just take, I can point to it very specifically. If you look at the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5759)|
| 1:36:06| and you look at, this is number A, this is Exhibit A where the ordinance has all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5766)|
| 1:36:14| very specifics. You can look at page number, sorry it doesn't have page numbers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5774)|
| 1:36:27| It's section 4259. This would be the role and responsibility of the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| to do all of the recruiting going forward. That, I know we're getting into the weeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| of paperwork here, but this is important. If you look at the actual minutes of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| from the 11th that everyone approved, you'll see, or excuse me, November 10th, you'll see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5806)|
| 1:36:54| in the minutes of November 10th, I'm just picking out one example, but I'm happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| point out all four of them. On November 10th, it says clearly in the minutes from our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5819)|
| 1:37:11| at the bottom of the first page of the November 10 minutes, Chairman Jay asked if anyone objected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| to having the Knox County Sheriff's Office Administration take over all responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| related to recruiting new officers in a proactive way, then send them to the Mayor Council for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| procession, or processing is what it's supposed to say. All agreed and no one objected. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| that was where we all came to a consensus. We asked, we looked around the room, gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| everybody ample time to talk and everybody said that's the point of that one is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| sure that the Sheriff's Office took over all the recruiting and there could never be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| blame game of you didn't give us enough people. So each one of the four major parts of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| reforms can be tied right back to the minutes. There was one thing that we did not have consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| on. We voted, it didn't pass out, and it's not in this ordinance. So I just point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| that the four big buckets of the wake up the board, the recruiting, having Mayor Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| be part of training, and the transparency of the meetings were all things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| discussed and were of consensus. Chairman, if I may. So you're, just to clarify, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5895)|
| 1:38:23| saying those four changes are the only changes that are contained in all of these ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| Those are the four changes that came out. If you look at my analysis documents, I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| there are four things that came out of our committee. I realize, I know what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| And the rest of all of the changes came from our law director and he's happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| questions from that. Director Buch, I do have an email that was sent to you from Gina Oster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5920)|
| 1:38:48| our chairperson, and she did ask you what changes the law director was making and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| stated that the law director's office was not recommending any changes. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| I ever said that. Okay, I have your email here. Well then if you'll give it to me. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| I think that changes what I was referring to and that was what the committee and Larson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Jay were recommending. Yes, you said that Commissioner Jay and the chair were making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| changes. That's correct. Commissioner Stewart, you still have the floor. Okay, so to reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5956)|
| 1:39:31| that same meeting, the November 10th meeting, when we discussed that merit being part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| CODA training, it happened immediately without an ordinance change. Like they, right after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| that, our November committee meeting, am I correct? I'm sorry. I was. That's okay. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5984)|
| 1:39:53| you all, merit system, was able to become a part of, you immediately went to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| CODA training to be able to explain to new hires what your role is. Yes, we did. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| done that three times now. Since November 10th? Yes. Without an ordinance change? Without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| an ordinance change, yes. And I don't feel that needs to be an ordinance change. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| that could be in our policies and procedures really to be a law to say that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| go and do that kind of orientation. I think that's stretching it somewhat that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| done that without an ordinance change, yes. Right. Okay, so that is, that's kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| I'm hung up on is that, again, my understanding was that the purpose for this special committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6030)|
| 1:40:38| was to build this relationship between merit and the sheriff's office. And once we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| and state opinions that, oh yeah, it would be good if maybe we added more people to merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| That doesn't necessarily mean we're voting on the specifics of it. Yes, we threw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| ideas of requirements made for each individual person, what they're representing. But we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6057)|
| 1:41:05| still just, those are opinions. We never came back to really flesh anything out as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| which I was under the impression would happen as a recommendation. Okay, I'll just note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6072)|
| 1:41:21| that not a single comment was made of that during the time. All of the minutes were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| and not a single person mentioned or asked for official votes on official language at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| any time and throughout the last two and a half months that we've been processing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| and sitting down with both parties, no objections have been raised in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| Even for the last two weeks when everything's been put in place up until today. But forgive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| me, but there are actually a lot of changes and a change to three words that I'm even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| looking at right now changes the whole meaning of that portion of these ordinances. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| I don't feel comfortable pushing this through. So what is your recommendation? I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6123)|
| 1:42:13| to vote for moving this forward. I don't necessarily have a recommendation. Other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6133)|
| 1:42:20| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Just for clarification, I guess I'll direct my comments to Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6140)|
| 1:42:38| Boock. So it's my understanding then from the opening comments of Chairman Jay that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| when the Merit Council was established in 1970, that the County Commission had oversight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6165)|
| 1:42:52| of the Merit Council. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. And since 1970, the Merit Council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6172)|
| 1:43:01| actually funded through the Sheriff's Department budget. Correct. Okay. And then based on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6181)|
| 1:43:08| of these ordinance changes, it's basically been done to update policy and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| and procedures to bring it in line with, you know, because 1970 to 2021 is a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6195)|
| 1:43:28| Also is the Merit Council required under state statute to have open meetings? Oh yes. Every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| committee, anybody's got to have an open meeting in government, yes. Okay. And if the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6216)|
| 1:43:45| Commission has oversight over the Merit Council, would they have the authority to add or subtract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6225)|
| 1:43:53| personnel from that department? Yes, because it's all budgetary matter. Okay. But just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6233)|
| 1:44:08| because it's funded through the budget of the Sheriff's Department, the Sheriff does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| not have authority to? Ultimately not. Everything the Sheriff has has to go through what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| call a salary suit. Right. So that's independent. He does a salary suit. It's either agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6258)|
| 1:44:24| to by the Mayor or it's approved by the Chancellor. It's a suit that's filed with the Chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6264)|
| 1:44:32| It says here's all the spots, here's what the salary is, and they want approval. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6272)|
| 1:44:39| generally that's done straightforward by the Chancellor. Okay. Okay. But the Mayor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| the Law Director have authority to contest that. Our office never has, and I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6285)|
| 1:44:52| who the Mayor is. Okay. So if the Merit Council started out with, say, two employees in 1970| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| and they're at four employees now, let's say, who authorized those? I'm assuming the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6298)|
| 1:45:05| Council authorized that themselves, but I do not know. Okay. Okay. And then... Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6305)|
| 1:45:13| The Executive Director is here. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure I understood the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| Just to clarify again, did you say that the Merit Council was funded under the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| Office budget? Is that what you were saying? That was my question. No, it is not. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| under the Mayor of Knox County is who we follow. It's not under the Sheriff's Office budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6330)|
| 1:45:38| Is Mr. Caldwell here? Is that correct, sir? I wave yes or no. I thought I saw it one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| on a designation under the Sheriff's Department, but you're saying it's in the Mayor's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| budget? Yeah, it falls, yes, under Knox County under the Mayor. We do not follow. Our positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| are not through the Sheriff's Office budget. Okay. Well, he's checking on that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6356)|
| 1:46:08| And then this goes back to the ordinance. What was the reason... I can see the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| of adding more members to the Merit Council, but what was the reason to go to a number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| say seven, as opposed to a number like five? And I see the need where a member of commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6379)|
| 1:46:28| is assigned to certain entities, like we... Commissioner Durrett is now the representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| on the Ethics Committee. So I can see the need for having a commissioner on the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6394)|
| 1:46:41| Council, but... Chris, are you still looking that up? Okay. Well, I'll defer back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6401)|
| 1:46:49| chairman until he gets his... Yeah, Commissioner Schoonmaker, the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| around the board was... About the number was essentially... Right now the board is made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6414)|
| 1:47:01| up of three people, and the discussion was about making the board a bigger number, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6421)|
| 1:47:07| with other governing boards. And I think there were several suggestions of different numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6427)|
| 1:47:14| and I think that several people thought nine or 11 was too high, and that three to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| was too small, and so I think it was simply a middle ground. And then the discussion continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| about the different types of members that would be on there, and what the skill sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| would be, and why the skill sets would be, which is ultimately what turned into the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| in the ordinance. Looking also at other boards, one of our citizen representative, I spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| a lot of time talking about different boards that he examined in and around Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| that were different sizes, and that seemed to be a size that everybody was comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| with. Commissioner Lundy? I'll just have a question for Paula. What...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6468)|
| 1:47:59| I'm sorry, if you could speak into the mic, we can't hear you. Sorry. What about the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| that we're looking at? I'm looking at Exhibit A. Do you feel like there are any... Wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| I'm sorry, we still can't hear you. I feel like I'm loud over here. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| Yes, I can hear you. Oh, okay. As far as the document, do you feel like there's any power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| taken away from the Merit Council, or... For the Exhibit A, for the whole thing? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6498)|
| 1:48:25| Not per se the council, but as the employees. If you will look at, and I don't know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| which packet, it's in the Exhibit, two of the ordinances that they're looking at changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| 4258 and 4260, by simply adding three words, that these changes will be taken away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| the council and be by the sheriff, which totally changes transfers. Well, they'll no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| go by the classification plan that is set up, which is basically the job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6532)|
| 1:48:57| and the structured set of requirements for each position that we make sure each employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| makes to be eligible for another position. If they're eliminating that only under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| rules established by the Merit Council, which takes out the classification plan, and now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| it's going to be as determined strictly by the sheriff, that will totally change for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6555)|
| 1:49:22| the employees as far as transfers and not having to meet requirements set up by those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| It appears to me that will be a lack of protection for the employees if that goes away. It could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| mean that, depending on the transfer, because they've also gone deeper into changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| grievance. Right now, an employee has a right to grieve a transfer if they feel it was political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| in nature, and now they have changed that as well in these ordinance changes by taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| that out that a transfer can't be a grievable thing, of the three that are listed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| back of the new changes. Can you remind me again, why was the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6594)|

| 1:50:09| changes that were referenced in 4258 and 4260, I believe, is that correct? Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6609)|
| 1:50:19| the two that were referenced. Do you want to address those? Those were written by you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| and your department. First of all, this email that was referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6625)|
| 1:50:33| I was asked in an email by Ms. Oster, when she could expect to see ordinance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6633)|
| 1:50:40| I was requesting, and I said, Gina, this office is not requesting anything. We have been asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| by Commissioner Jay to review the 50-year-old Merit Council agenda and make changes as suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| by Commissioner Jay, the Sheriff, and the outdatedness of the ordinance. Once we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| completed that task, we will attach it to Agenda Quick for all to review and be glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| to forward a copy to your office. That was done March 11th. That's when we finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6662)|
| 1:51:09| There was nothing I was specifically doing. He came to me and said, here's what I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| like to see. As I went through it, I noted that there are a lot of things that had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| be done or should be done with regard to the Merit Council. Those were itemized. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6680)|
| 1:51:28| was ethics training. Our ordinance says everybody, everybody has to take ethics training. I added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| that in there. That includes Merit Council. They have all done that before. You recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6694)|
| 1:51:40| that. Actually, Mr. Armstrong had recommended that and all the members have done that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| I put that in there as to 49 and 60. 42-58 has to do with the competitive test list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6705)|
| 1:52:04| eligibles. It doesn't really change anything for recruits that want to come in and go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| work. It doesn't change anything. It still has this eligible list and the Sheriff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| requested it. I said, and the request of the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| It's the background checks to be done by the Sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| Absolutely. There's nothing wrong with that. I understood partly when I was researching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| this particular issue that the Merit Council doesn't have the ability to get all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6752)|
| 1:52:39| back into NCIC and get background checks like the Sheriff does. I was told that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6759)|
| 1:52:45| were suggestions of eligible people that then the Sheriff did his own and found out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| some of the suggestions coming from the Merit Council actually were convicted felons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| They do have background to follow up, yes. Why do it twice? The Sheriff knows how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6778)|
| 1:53:06| get in there and find out if you've got any convicted felons or child molesters or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| else. That's pretty important. That was put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| The rules promulgated by the Merit System Council. There is nobody that doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| rules that are run by and approved by the County Commission. That's just a given. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| the control they have because right now it's almost like the Board of Health, the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6810)|
| 1:53:38| Merit Council is set up. You can make all your own rules all you want. Nobody's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| any control of them. Absolute, just make your rules however you want. That's why that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| Then I had in there about the limitations should be in compliance with all federal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6830)|
| 1:53:56| state laws relating to hiring and placement of individuals. That's just common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| I've added that in there to make sure that there was compliance with federal rules because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6841)|
| 1:54:07| we get sued over in federal court on hiring and firing and everything virtually daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6847)|
| 1:54:13| So if this is in here, they can't say that we don't have a policy that protects that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6853)|
| 1:54:21| So that's that one. What was the other one, 52, 42, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| Transfers are already in there. The Sheriff has the absolute authority to transfer, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| That's already in those rules. It just makes it clear that he does as determined by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| Sheriff. He can't cut their salary. He can't cut them out of anything. But lateral transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6876)|
| 1:54:44| within a class, that's what this is talking about. It's a lateral transfer within a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| It's not transferring to a lower pay grade or anything. It's within that. That's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| that says. He has the right to make those transfers. And that takes away no rights from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6894)|
| 1:55:02| those two things. It takes away any rights of any of the uniformed officers. They still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6902)|
| 1:55:08| got all the rights that they have under the way it is right now. So I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| anything's changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| Mr. Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I mean, it's a lot. It was a lot when we convened the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| I remember kind of going to that committee and not knowing much about what we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6928)|
| 1:55:35| to talk about, learning a lot, gathering information, and so forth. I guess I'm a little bit troubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| by the very first item. So the very first item was the ordinance changes to expand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6941)|
| 1:55:49| size of the Merit Council to seven. So I'm not saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| You're talking about the first page of the Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Yes, the first page of the Exhibit A. Yeah, not the ordinance itself. Look, I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6957)|
| 1:56:05| some changes don't need to be made. Maybe some of these changes need to be made. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6965)|
| 1:56:14| here's the deal. Anybody on this body can bring an ordinance. We all know that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6974)|
| 1:56:23| I don't recall ever leaving a meeting feeling like there was a consensus to expand the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| of the Merit Council to any particular number. And even as I read the minutes, I only see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| two people that explicitly said they thought that it should be bigger. And I mean, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| a lot of discussion. There's a lot of information. There's a lot of opinions. But I just don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7002)|
| 1:56:49| see any consensus to expand the size of the Merit Council coming from the committee. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7009)|
| 1:56:57| if you want to propose it, that's fine. And if you want to craft an ordinance based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7017)|
| 1:57:05| discussion and information that was gathered by the committee, that's good. But I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| think it's necessarily correct to call them recommendations of the committee, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| I don't think the committee made any official recommendations. That's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7038)|
| 1:57:27| Commissioner, Director Book, I don't know who was first over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| With regard to that, Commissioner, I wasn't at any of those meetings. I don't know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| transpired. I do know that as part of when Commissioner Jay came to me about the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7056)|
| 1:57:45| Council, and you've heard from the Sheriff, you've heard all around there's issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| have to be resolved ultimately. But the number, when I did my research, the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7069)|
| 1:57:58| has five members on its Merit Council. Memphis, Shelby County, five members on its Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7078)|
| 1:58:07| Nashville-Davidson County, five members on its Merit Council. Chattanooga has nine members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| on its Merit Council. And that's part of why I didn't have any trouble. It was Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7093)|
| 1:58:21| Jay's thing for seven. But I definitely, as my legal opinion was, to follow that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7101)|
| 1:58:28| you really need more than three members on it, because it acts as a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| And just like the Ethics Committee, we've got numerous members on that. It's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7113)|

| 1:58:47| Commissioner Durrett? Director Buch, I have a couple questions. When you say the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| of Knoxville has five members on its Merit Council, what do those members, what does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| that Merit Council represent? That Merit Council represents the police department, the firefighters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| and all other, quote, classified employees. Does that include, say, those classified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| employees for the City of Knoxville government? For Knoxville, that's correct. Okay. So would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7150)|
| 1:59:16| it be a fair assumption to say that those five people represent a larger population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| than the Merit System Council does for the Sheriff's Office? That I don't know. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7162)|
| 1:59:30| hard to say, because I don't know the populations of those workers. Okay. Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| I apologize. I do, it's 1,500 is what the City of Knoxville represents. And? Under their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| civil service protection. And what does our Merit Council for the Sheriff's Office, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7182)|
| 1:59:50| that population? Around 1,000, give or take at certain times, depending on the openings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| that they have. It's right at 1,000. Okay. And my other question is, it was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| in our January 14th committee meeting, the last one, a concern that an elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| could not actually serve on the Merit System Council due to state law. What was the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7208)|
| 2:00:16| of that? Mr. Morton said he was going to research that. I'm not sure what Mr. Morton was asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7216)|
| 2:00:24| to do, or research, but I don't understand what the state law was on that. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7224)|
| 2:00:34| what state law that prevents that. We could double check with Mr. Morton if he had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| official running, but I believe he said that you could have a commissioner on there. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| mean, there's a home rule part of our charter and our ordinances that would allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| do that and gave us the ability to do that separate of the standard of state law, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7249)|
| 2:00:54| we could verify that before next week. Mr. Boak, if you could. I'm making a note of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7254)|
| 2:01:03| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Durd, did you have more questions? Commissioner Daly? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7263)|
| 2:01:11| you, Mr. Chairman. I've been going over this, and there's good points in here, and I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7271)|
| 2:01:18| there's some bad points. If we can make both sides equally mad, I think we've done our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7278)|
| 2:01:27| job. Adding the seven members, seven may be a good number, five may be better. I do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7287)|
| 2:01:36| think, I do agree that a county commissioner should be there, but as a non-voting member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| To me, it would be a, what's the word I'm looking for? Director Buick? Ex-officio. No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7302)|
| 2:01:55| it's conflict of interest. The Merritt Council serves under the county commission, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7315)|
| 2:02:03| got Courtney as our commissioner, at this committee, but she's there as a non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7323)|
| 2:02:10| member. So I have a heartburn about that, that this is not, I'd love to see a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| commissioner on there, but not as a non-voting member. I like the number seven, with six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| being the alternate that can vote when a fifth member is not there, and that alternate could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| be ready to move in, and the seventh being, of course, the county commissioner for non-voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7348)|

| 2:02:42| we're all on first name basis, I apologize, to the law director, and the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| got some of my questions there that he's going to be going over. Stuff to do about term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7368)|
| 2:02:56| Stuff to do about, you know, what can the Merritt Council hear? It looks like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| going to be in a big lawsuit, it's going to cost the taxpayers a lot of money, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| I hope that they rethink that, and I ask the request for what's the cost so far on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| lawsuit? There's two of them. The first one was $13,000. The second one, I haven't got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| an ongoing billing on the present issue before the... Those are to deal with the use of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7401)|

| 2:03:36| Council. It clearly is not. Under their present rules, it's not even there. What I've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| to do in this is since... Could you elaborate on that while we're talking about it? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| we know because we've read it, but... The present issue is that this person, the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7428)|
| 2:03:59| had been granted, going back to Tim Hutchison, evidently an automobile and a gas credit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| and that continued on through the subsequent sheriffs and then Sheriff Spangler. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7447)|
| 2:04:15| just being used for personal use, to drive back and forth and whatever personal use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| and clearly that's not allowed. Also, under the rules as they exist, that is not a grievable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| appealable offense. Clearly, there is no... The rule itself says, that goes back to 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| whenever they did this, says that the county property, the sheriff's property, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7474)|
| 2:04:42| automobiles, nobody has a vested interest in that. There's a court case that's 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| old out of Court of Appeals when Sheriff Fowler was there and said, look, if the sheriff takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| away your car, that's his authority to do, and that is not a grievable offense. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| that's the law, and that's what I've stated, but we've got a lawsuit going on it, and because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| our office made the opinion that there was no, under their existing rule, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| was no jurisdiction to hear that, and there was no authority to tell the sheriff or anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7512)|
| 2:05:19| that had to give this person a late model car and a gas card for personal use. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7519)|
| 2:05:27| it just doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7527)|

| 2:05:35| He's asking me a question of what my opinion was, and he asked what it was about, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| telling him. It's not an ongoing lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7539)|
| 2:05:42| I thought it was a case of reserve for executive sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| No, I don't think this is. I've just, that opinion that I rendered, I'm just stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7544)|
| 2:05:49| is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| I agree with you. It's not, I don't think you're discussing the merits of the case as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| far as that goes. You know, I just don't want to see us taxpayers, I don't want to see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7555)|
| 2:06:01| taxpayers spend money that's, man, I would love to have the money in South Knox. I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7561)|
| 2:06:08| this ordinance is 51 years old, as of 2021. It needs to be changed. I spoke to you, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7568)|
| 2:06:15| I said that my suggestion is that it be done in parts. Let's look at the terms and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7575)|
| 2:06:22| many's on there, one resolution, one change. Then we go through the next one, look at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| change. We do it, not a confusing, I'm hearing, I've heard two sides. I've heard that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7588)|
| 2:06:38| rules, yeah, this was what was agreed upon, but then I'm hearing, no, that's not what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7598)|
| 2:06:44| agreed upon. Seven wasn't voted on. Anything comes out of the rules committee, we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| on it individually. None of it was voted on. That's what I'm hearing. So right now, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7610)|
| 2:06:56| have to say that I would not vote to move this forward, but I would say that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| to revisit this in single items, is what I would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7620)|
| 2:07:07| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| Thank you, Chair. Mr. Law Director, do I understand that the Sheriff's Department has attorneys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7630)|
| 2:07:24| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| So why are they not defending the Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| Their attorneys are simply advisory attorneys to the Sheriff. When the Sheriff gets sued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7654)|
| 2:07:43| or an officer, we take that case in our office. That's under the Charter. Now, who's down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| there, he's got a couple of lawyers that he uses as advisory only. So they're not litigators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7669)|
| 2:07:57| and they don't have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| So you all are defending the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| We started off, we would defend... You've got to look at one of these...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| I'm just confused why we're paying for outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| I was getting ready to suggest and tell you why when we got sidetracked. We normally would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7694)|
| 2:08:21| handle that and do handle it and started to, but when we gave the opinion with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7701)|
| 2:08:29| the... Since we represent the Merit Council, the Merit Council, hey, look at this. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7709)|
| 2:08:36| don't have jurisdiction to hear this and you don't have the authority to grant the relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| that was requested. As soon as that was done and that was our honest opinion, it still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| is, and I think it would uphold anywhere. But once that happened, we were accused by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7726)|
| 2:08:52| the complainant and his attorneys having a conflict of interest. Well, under our Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7732)|
| 2:09:00| if there is a conflict of interest, then we have to get outside counsel, and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| outside counsel was hired. But normally, in these cases, we would be in there defending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7745)|
| 2:09:12| the action of the sheriff because the individual complainant would have their own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| That's why there's outside counsel in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| Because the other party claimed that the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7763)|
| 2:09:33| had a conflict of interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| That's correct. Because of the opinion that we had given the Merit Council, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| an argument, and it's all public record. Everything I've said here is public record. It's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| same argument that's being made by outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7785)|
| 2:09:49| I kind of echo a little bit of what Commissioner Beehler had said, that I don't know a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7789)|
| 2:10:00| about this. This has been a real learning curve for me. I did come and sit in on one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| of the committee meetings as an observer to try to learn a few things and figure out what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7804)|
| 2:10:12| was happening. What I do know is that if this document that's presented to us, it's clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7812)|
| 2:10:27| not what the Merit Council is supporting, and that's concerning to me because I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7827)|
| 2:10:35| thinking the result of the committee was to try to come to some agreement. So I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7835)|

| 2:10:47| I don't know if this committee had authority to vote. I really don't know any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7847)|

| 2:10:58| It's very, very concerning to me that when this document was presented, that I had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7858)|
| 2:11:13| only Merit Council people, but Sheriff's deputies contacting me, very concerned that this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7873)|
| 2:11:21| weaken the role of the Merit Council and, in fact, take away some of the initial purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7881)|
| 2:11:31| of why the council was created. Now, quite honestly, I don't know enough to know if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| does or not. I mean, that's just quite honestly where I am in all this. It's very confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| as we read it. I kind of support also what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| Daly said, that it sounds like, I believe this is what you were saying, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7907)|
| 2:11:55| this might be a good working document. I don't know if the best thing to do is for this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7915)|
| 2:12:04| to reconvene or for Sheriff's representatives and the Merit Council to come together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7924)|
| 2:12:12| hash these out one by one and bring us back a document that you both can agree on as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7932)|
| 2:12:20| as possible, and then where there are very specific conflicts, to be able to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7940)|
| 2:12:28| us a document and say, now, we don't agree with this and we don't agree with this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7948)|
| 2:12:35| mean, right now, no one from the Sheriff's department has contacted me and said, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| yes, this is great. You know, so I don't even really know how they feel about it. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| I need that input. I need that input from the Sheriff's department as well as from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7967)|

| 2:13:03| bottom line is what's going to be best for our Sheriff's deputies. And so I'm very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| reluctant to make a recommendation to push this forward when I'm not at all convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=7990)|

| 2:13:34| to look up the information I requested? Consulting with our HR director, we have researched it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8014)|

| 2:15:10| They didn't hire attorneys? No, no. Okay, excuse me. Our office hired the attorney because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8110)|
| 2:15:13| of an allegation of conflict. Okay, so they're, okay, gotcha. They didn't have any, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8113)|

| 2:15:49| at any rate, he made it clear that he did not want to in any way reduce the rights and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| protections to the officers. And when we drafted this, I can assure you that nothing in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8155)|
| 2:16:02| nobody's pointed out to me anywhere that this thing, this document before you in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| takes away any of the protections for the classified officers of Knox County. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8168)|
| 2:16:16| have no reason not to believe that. I do not at all. I just am expressing grave concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8176)|
| 2:16:27| when there are folks that do believe it does. And whether it does or doesn't, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8187)|
| 2:16:37| an attorney. I'm not a sheriff's deputy. I don't know. But until I can feel a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8197)|
| 2:16:45| better about the Merit Council being comfortable that they still are going to be able to fulfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| their role that they have been appointed to do by virtue of, this is from the state, isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8213)|
| 2:17:05| it? No. Where did the Merit Council, I mean, what started that in the beginning? The Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8225)|
| 2:17:12| Council started in 1970 by a private act of the legislature. And then when we became a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8232)|
| 2:17:18| charter form, we adopted the private act in ordinance in 1990. So it's nothing to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| the state. Well, I misspoke. When I said the state, I meant by legislation. It was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8246)|
| 2:17:32| that was legislated. Legislated by this body. The county commission legislated it. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8252)|
| 2:17:42| County commission legislated it. However, the history of the Merit Council, that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8262)|
| 2:17:49| not legislated through our state representatives? Back before the days, back in the old days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| when we didn't have a commission, we had three judges, all of that. The only way you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8275)|
| 2:18:00| get anything done in the county was by private act. So they passed a private act, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8280)|
| 2:18:08| this basic document right here, and it had to be approved by two-thirds. Well, no, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8288)|
| 2:18:15| was after the three-judge thing. There was a commission. I don't know how many there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| were. It had to be approved by two-thirds vote of the commission, which was done. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8298)|
| 2:18:22| that private act then became an act of this body. And then when we became a charter form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8302)|
| 2:18:28| of government in 1990, we simply, by ordinance in 1990, adopted that private act. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8308)|
| 2:18:35| Well, I'm hearing very clearly from the Merit Council that they do not feel like this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8315)|
| 2:18:44| is going to protect their officers. Well, if they would give me the itemization of where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8324)|
| 2:18:50| they say it takes it away, I'm still waiting to hear that. I haven't heard that. And I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| not suggesting that shouldn't happen. I promise, David, this isn't directed at you. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| just directed at what I'm hearing, not only from the council, but from the officers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8340)|
| 2:19:07| are in the department. So I just can't ignore that. I just can't ignore that. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| why I'm suggesting that perhaps you all... I can't speak on behalf of the council themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8352)|
| 2:19:21| They have their own opinions. But my opinion is that, for whatever it matters, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| doing this for a long time. If this wasn't surreptitiously done and that we were included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8366)|
| 2:19:31| in on it, then it probably would have been a different process. But there are several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| more changes that were included that were not recommended by this committee. And a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8376)|
| 2:19:42| of them weren't even discussed during the committee. And that's concerning to me, whether...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| Can I weigh in on this? It was clearly stated in the analysis that what came out of committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8387)|
| 2:19:55| were four items. And then that the law director and the law department looked at the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| ordinance and said, after 50 years, this needs an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| To be cleaned up. And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| Every other point in here came from the law director and the law department. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| went through line by line and said, this needs to be changed. This needs to be changed right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| now. And this has been in the hands of both Ms. Taylor and the mayor council for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8414)|
| 2:20:22| Not a single peep or a single question or a single ask. And I have made myself more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| than available. Book has made himself more than available. And not a single... Like he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8428)|

| 2:20:37| response. Not a single question. Let me be clear. The mayor council will never be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8437)|
| 2:20:42| with this. Do you know why? Because right now the mayor council gets to make its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| rules. It's governed by three people, two of which are related. And it gets to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8446)|
| 2:20:52| in its own bubble with no oversight. Like the Board of Health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| This changes that. It changes it to allow for a larger, more independent body of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| to make decisions on behalf of the officers with different skill sets, without the relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8462)|
| 2:21:11| It lengthens the amount of time that people can serve on the mayor council so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| not part of the previous administration by a series of years. It puts in place transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| so that all meetings have to be publicly noticed, have to be recorded in audio and visual, have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| to be open to the public in every way, shape, and form so everyone has a fair shake. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| gives all of the responsibility to the sheriff's office to recruit so they can start filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8492)|
| 2:21:37| people into the pipeline, which takes away something from the mayor council. But it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| codifies that the mayor council has to be part of training and codification. Those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| the four big reforms. They will never be happy with changing how things are because change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8506)|

| 2:21:53| Well, and it is regretful if that was, in these last two weeks, that that was not communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8513)|
| 2:21:59| to you all. I know that I am not the only commissioner that heard from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8519)|

| 2:22:09| Can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| But let me say one thing, be very clear. Every commissioner on this stage and every member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8531)|
| 2:22:17| of the special committee, including the mayor council, all received everything that is before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8537)|

| 2:22:28| questions because I haven't heard anybody in two weeks. We were available for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8553)|

| 2:23:02| things and that's concerning. Did you, did you or any of the mayor council make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| effort to contact the law department or talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8588)|
| 2:23:13| I have spoken with Myers Morton, who is the law director to our office, but not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8593)|
| 2:23:18| in depth of this because the changes were already made. Yes, we've had 11 days to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| those, but I, who work with them daily, would have to review them. Then I had to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| to each council member separately. And so it's a very time consuming process. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| was no time involved to even reach out to each commissioner and go down through every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| single change for you all to even be able to understand in 11 days what you're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| voting on when you have little knowledge about it up front anyway. So it's a lot of changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8624)|
| 2:23:51| Again, the committee was formed to work on the relationship, which is fractured even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8631)|
| 2:23:56| more so than it began with before the committee started. If we were going to do that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| which is fine, it should have been more along the lines of something like this. That committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8641)|
| 2:24:06| mainly revolved around the hiring process. And that's what the only thing that was voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8646)|
| 2:24:12| on, which was voted down, which was taking some control away from mayor council and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| it in the hands of the HR department. And that was the only item voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8657)|
| 2:24:25| Commissioner Ward? Commissioner Hilda? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8665)|
| 2:24:31| The only thing that was voted down was the, what you just said, was who hires, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8671)|
| 2:24:39| It was a proposal to change some of the hiring process, yes, and taking it out of mayor council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8679)|
| 2:24:45| hands and allowing the sheriff's office, HR department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8685)|
| 2:24:49| It was who schedules the psychological exams. That specifically, or who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| That specifically, who schedules the psychological exams. Currently the mayor council does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8693)|
| 2:24:58| The proposal was to have the sheriff's department do that, to have a continuous process. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8698)|
| 2:25:04| was the only item that did not have consensus. And after two meetings of not having consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| it was clear we needed to take a vote either way because every other item had consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8710)|
| 2:25:14| from all the members. That was the only thing that didn't have consensus. And so we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8714)|
| 2:25:18| it up for a vote. It failed. It did not get included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| It sounds like the two commissioners that are on there don't feel the same way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| you do, that you see it differently than they saw it. I hear from a lot of my other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8724)|
| 2:25:29| that are not 100% comfortable with it. I went and talked to the sheriff about it and I told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| him I'm not 100% confident with it. I was sitting in his office, I told him to his face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| I said, I can't vote for this. I said, there's a lot of things in here I do like. I do see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| the need for it. I see that we do need to make some changes going forward. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| this is the right approach for it. I would like to see it come out of rules instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| just coming out to the floor as an ordinance and have some more discussion and have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8750)|
| 2:25:54| more education on it before. So I'm going to be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Can you repeat that? Come out of where? I think maybe coming out of our rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| or something like that would be better off for it since we're the ones making the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| for another committee. Or no, my mistake. Our rules committee is specifically about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| the rules of the commission, not about other entities. That's why the special committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8771)|
| 2:26:17| was formed. The special committee didn't make any recommendations from what I'm hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| from everybody else. Only voted on one thing and that one thing got voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8781)|
| 2:26:26| Every member of the committee voted on the minutes. Every committee participated in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8786)|
| 2:26:33| was written down and approved every one of those. Commissioner Smith? Oh, sorry, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8793)|
| 2:26:40| Bigg-Jay, do I? Oh, sorry, I'm not sure you're on mute. Yeah, I'd just like to make a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8800)|
| 2:26:44| motion if that's okay. I'd like to make a substitute motion to deny this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| I'll second it. So the motion on the floor was to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8809)|
| 2:26:55| without recommendation. The substitute motion is to, is that the proper form, is to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| it? That's like a double negative. If you, I don't think you can make a motion to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8822)|
| 2:27:09| if you don't move it, if you vote no, it wouldn't move forward without recommendation. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8829)|
| 2:27:17| correct? I'll call for the vote then. Okay. Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8837)|
| 2:27:27| we had a fox controversy two years ago and we killed it at workshop. We voted no, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8847)|
| 2:27:35| motion was to deny because the fox was an exotic animal and we were just going to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8855)|
| 2:27:39| the ordinance and we voted no and it did not come up for commission. That's right, it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8859)|
| 2:27:45| come to commission meeting if you vote no, vote no to deny it on this. But the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| on the floor is to move forward without recommendation, so if you vote no to that it wouldn't go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8871)|
| 2:27:58| Commissioner Smith has not had a chance to speak. Would you all allow him to speak before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8878)|
| 2:28:02| calling for anything? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Some hindsight is awful helpful in a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8882)|
| 2:28:14| things. A lot of these language and procedural changes to this ordinance probably could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| been really benefited if the law director would have looked through the ordinance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| brought that to the committee that was formed. That way they could have discussed those type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| of changes there and it doesn't come to us without vetting from the committee it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8911)|
| 2:28:38| sent to for recommendations. I agree with Commissioner Dale. This in a lump sum package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8918)|
| 2:28:49| is very, some of this I like, some of this I don't. Maybe we should bring this back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8929)|
| 2:28:57| piecemeal. That way we can get in detail into each item of it instead of just a wholesale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8937)|
| 2:29:06| approval of one large ordinance change. I really think it would have been beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8946)|
| 2:29:14| to have had the law director read through the ordinance, study the ordinance, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| actually made a presentation at the special call committee on the things other than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| big four, the fine tuning language change things. That's my opinion. Mr. Lutter? I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8966)|
| 2:29:39| there's a lot to be said. Since this isn't, there are, the numbered parts, they're separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| and I think there's a lot to be said for what Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Dale said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8986)|
| 2:29:52| There may be things in there that the commission as a whole likes and some that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=8992)|
| 2:30:00| If there's a substitute motion, I think it would be to hear each item separately. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9000)|
| 2:30:09| can have that separate motion, but that's something that this body could do or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9009)|
| 2:30:16| vote it down and then it gets brought up again, maybe with another motion to look at it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9016)|
| 2:30:23| separately. It's up to this body, but there's a lot to be said for the piecemeal look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9023)|
| 2:30:32| If it's okay with everybody to continue this discussion, I think it's a helpful discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9032)|
| 2:30:36| as we process through it. I see Commissioner Beeler, Commissioner Biggs, I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9036)|
| 2:30:44| Schoonmaker, I think you had your light on. Is everybody okay to continue the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| for a moment as we work through this? We can let them talk. There was for a second, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9049)|
| 2:30:58| I want to just... I do have a question. Commissioner Schoonmaker, let me start here and I'll work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9058)|
| 2:31:06| my way over. Thank you, Chairman Jay. Jim Wright, would you mind coming down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9066)|
| 2:31:12| podium please, sir? You can state your name and address. Jim Wright, Jr., 1127 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9072)|
| 2:31:29| Thank you. Have we talked about this in advance? No, sir. Okay. I've known your family, I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9089)|
| 2:31:37| known you, I have a lot of respect for your family and you. When you read over these changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9097)|
| 2:31:46| in Exhibit A, did you feel like some of those would be a valuable change to make as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9106)|
| 2:31:55| as the Merit Council goes? Some of them could be, yes, sir. To answer your question, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9115)|
| 2:32:03| some of them could be. Okay, and then do you feel like that when you read the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| that those changes interfered with the rights of our law enforcement personnel? To be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9129)|
| 2:32:19| with you, yes, sir. Would you say it was one page of the ten pages or whatever this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9139)|
| 2:32:27| or just two or three? Not all of it, but there's some things in there that I really, I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9147)|
| 2:32:43| this position because I'm here for the officers. I respect the Sheriff, he's a great man. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9163)|
| 2:32:50| have a lot of respect for him, but I took this job to be here for the officers, fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9170)|
| 2:32:56| and equitable hiring, promotions, and to hear grievances, and to protect the officers. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| why I do this. This lady right here, she knows it inside and out. I'm a volunteer. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9183)|
| 2:33:12| you are. And I do my best to, like a few of you said, it's very confusing, and it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9192)|
| 2:33:20| But the way that this was presented, I don't think this is the way to do it. I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9200)|
| 2:33:27| think there's some things in there that we could pick apart, and we could have some common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| ground, and we could work together with, but this is not the way to do it. Okay, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9211)|
| 2:33:39| just for my benefit, who's the chairman and the vice chairman of the Merit Council? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| chairman is Ms. Gina Oster, and there is no vice chairman. Okay, I thought I saw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9224)|
| 2:33:53| in your rules. That's correct. That was part of the proposed changes. All right, Jim, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9233)|
| 2:33:58| you, and I do appreciate your service on that. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Buehler. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a quick comment. I have to agree with what Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9244)|
| 2:34:09| and Commissioner Smith have suggested, and I also agree with what Mr. Boock says, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9249)|
| 2:34:15| I don't think that's something that can be done in these seven days. I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9255)|
| 2:34:19| something that does need to be looked at separately going forward, but not this month. Mr. Bussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9259)|
| 2:34:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair. We've heard from both sides, and I was looking at some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9272)|
| 2:34:37| rules of engagement here. I hear when Mr. Wright got up here and said there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9277)|
| 2:34:44| things in there that could be changed or there are some things that he wants to stand with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| and the law director has some things that said should be changed for the protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9289)|
| 2:34:53| of the county. I'm hearing all this at this time. I would like to hear the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9293)|
| 2:35:00| that they say that this makes, and I would like a response back from the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| on the differences they say that's in there that makes this unattainable for the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| Council and get an answer that way. To restate, if I'm clarifying or just understanding your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9313)|
| 2:35:24| question, you'd like to hear what are the objections from the Merit Council as to what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| proposed specifically and hear the law director's response to that. Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9328)|
| 2:35:33| They're telling us what they say is in that document. I haven't sat in on the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9333)|
| 2:35:41| and then I hear our law director say these are some changes that should be or needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| be made. I would like to know the differences so they can respond to it and let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9347)|
| 2:35:54| so we can make a more educated judgment on where this goes through or it dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9354)|
| 2:36:08| My point to the document as a whole is there are several changes. Again, not every change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9368)|
| 2:36:17| was discussed that is included in there. I do realize the law director is making changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9377)|
| 2:36:23| that they feel that needs to be made, and there are changes in there I agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| needs to happen. However, as a whole, and what it can change without you all understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9388)|
| 2:36:37| as well as the employees, because I speak to the employees as well, too, because they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9397)|
| 2:36:41| seen this. They're talking about it. They're asking questions about it. The way this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| handled was not right. Yes, we had 11 days, but I wasn't talking with the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9407)|
| 2:36:55| informing them. There's a ton of changes in here. This is several sections of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| that are affected. The way that it was handled and how we were completely left out of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| changes or discussions without being able, it's just the way that it was handled was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| wrong. Okay, so the biggest thing that you're saying is it was the way it was handled. Along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9432)|
| 2:37:20| with some of the changes that were being made. Okay, the changes is what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| But I would like time to digest it and hand this in paper form for us to look at it physically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9446)|
| 2:37:34| and then we can present it to the law director and he'll tell us about those objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| And then we can make a decision. But right now, you say there's changes in here, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9459)|
| 2:37:45| I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. He says there are changes in here that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| be made. Right. And I don't know what he's talking about. Right. So for me, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9469)|
| 2:37:54| be flip a coin, heads or tails, and make a decision, and I don't want to do that. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9474)|
| 2:38:02| Hearing the comments and getting the feedback from the commission, perhaps I can suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| a path forward. I think there are some very good work that a lot of people put in over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| a long period of time to try to build some good reforms in process. I also hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| I'm not, there's not a lot of people comfortable with where we are today, and perhaps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9500)|
| 2:38:25| it needs to be taken in different sections instead of one whole thing. But I also, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9505)|
| 2:38:31| Buster makes a point. Zero response is given or any, we have concerns with this, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9511)|
| 2:38:39| talk about it for almost two weeks. And so that needs to happen. So I have a suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9519)|
| 2:38:46| going forward. I'll withdraw the motion to move forward without recommendation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9526)|
| 2:38:51| will take it off of this month's commission meeting. I'll send a formal letter to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| Taylor and the members of the Merit Council saying, based upon what has been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9536)|
| 2:39:01| to you, what objections do you have and why, specifically, and ask for that to be sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9541)|
| 2:39:07| back in five, is five days enough, ten days enough, how much time, five days? Yes. Within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| the week, to be sent back to myself and Mr. Boak to review and answer as many questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9554)|
| 2:39:20| as possible. I'll also open up the invitation and I'll send it to you all tonight, to every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| commissioner here, to say what questions, concerns do you have to, because the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| committee, special call committee's work is done and that committee has been, has completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9571)|
| 2:39:37| its work and it's not meeting again. We could reform it, but I think it would be better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| to hear what are the concerns and then we will work on that this month. And then in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9581)|
| 2:39:46| April, I'll come back and bring it back as Ordinance Part 1, Part 2, Part 5, Part 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9586)|
| 2:39:53| Part 10, and hopefully answer as many questions as possible and see if there's a path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| for any one of those. Does that seem digestible and acceptable to the committee? Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9599)|
| 2:40:07| Mr. Boesler? Thank you, Mr. Chair. As soon as you get those back in, and as soon as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9607)|
| 2:40:14| get that, could you get it to us as soon as possible? Absolutely. Thank you. Point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9614)|
| 2:40:20| order. We have a motion to deny on the table. You cannot withdraw your motion until that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9620)|
| 2:40:27| motion, substitute motion is voted on. There wasn't a motion made to deny. I made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9627)|
| 2:40:34| It was made and seconded. A substitute motion wasn't made yet. We were still having discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9634)|
| 2:40:41| Mr. Biggs made a substitute motion to deny and is seconded by Mr. Ward. And then we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9641)|
| 2:40:48| about what could and couldn't be done on a substitute motion. And we should have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| done the motion. If I withdraw the original motion, then this isn't even the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9651)|
| 2:41:00| ordinance to move forward with our recommendation. It's a moot point. It pulls it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9660)|
| 2:41:05| Is that accurate? Yeah, I mean, I've never seen that in the Robert's Rule. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9665)|
| 2:41:11| without research what that would do, but I don't think you can have a, you're either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9671)|
| 2:41:19| going to vote to the original thing. The substitute motion would have had to be with regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| the absolute thing, like we're going to do it in sections or something like that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9685)|
| 2:41:31| the substitute motion was nothing more than if this body said no, it would be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| it would be off. So it was superfluous is what I'm saying. Commissioner Smith. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| you, Mr. Chairman. I'm going to try to see if I can procedurally get this correct. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9705)|
| 2:41:55| don't know if you can withdraw. You are the sponsor of the motion. But that motion has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9715)|
| 2:42:02| already been offered to the floor. I know in zoning, we let an applicant withdraw their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9722)|
| 2:42:09| zoning request, but that's due to property right issues. I'm kind of wondering if maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9729)|
| 2:42:22| the best thing we do moving forward here is we just go ahead with the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9742)|
| 2:42:26| If it's denied, maybe that's the best thing that can happen, a fresh start to this, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| we could bring it back piecemeal. If it's denied, you can't bring it back for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| It's a different ordinance. You're bringing back something totally different next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9758)|
| 2:42:47| It's the same ordinance. If you break it up into pieces, even if the language has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9767)|
| 2:42:51| a little bit, it's still the same ordinance. It's a different ordinance. Also, we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9771)|
| 2:43:01| voting on the ordinance. We are now voting on moving the ordinance forward. Can we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| some clarification, Director Book, please? Wow. First of all, the person making the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9786)|
| 2:43:14| motion, your rule is he can withdraw it, she can withdraw it, with approval of the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9794)|
| 2:43:20| if the second goes along with it. If it gets withdrawn. The second thing is that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9800)|
| 2:43:27| got a quote substitute motion, which is not truly a substitute motion. It was just basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9807)|
| 2:43:33| a vote to not go forward. So it wasn't truly a substitute motion is what I'm saying. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9813)|
| 2:43:41| was just, I'm making a motion to vote no. Basically, that's what that was. So I question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9821)|
| 2:43:50| that. Going back and get through that quagmire, certainly the maker of the motion on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9830)|
| 2:43:58| can withdraw it. Director Book, I appreciate how you, my motion was to deny, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9838)|
| 2:44:05| this entire ordinance, because I feel like it should be brought back in subsections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9845)|
| 2:44:14| So my motion is actually to deny this as an entirety. Well, you can't vote to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9854)|
| 2:44:21| You can just vote on whether you're going to go forward with it or not, because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| is a work session. So a no means... The motion was to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9866)|
| 2:44:33| If that was brought to a vote, you could vote yes, which would move it forward, or you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| vote no, which would not move it forward. That is, that's, you can't add a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| motion to say I'm not going to move forward, because that's just your vote. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| he's saying. But he's also, the law director, just to reply, or just to clarify, the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9887)|
| 2:44:54| of the motion can withdraw if the second agrees, and it's not voted upon, and it goes off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9894)|
| 2:45:00| agenda. Well, it does, but Commissioner Biggs makes a point there. It could go forward on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9900)|
| 2:45:10| a, you could make a motion that it go forward without approval on, as he said, looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9910)|
| 2:45:18| each item, which is a specific ordinance item. It's a quagmire we're in, and basically his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9918)|
| 2:45:26| substitute motion, he can't vote on turning down a, because this is not a voting session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| This is just setting the agenda. So he's either voting to not put, not send it forward, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| to send it forward. That's his vote, but that's what this whole commission's going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9940)|
| 2:45:45| on anyway. That's why I say it's a quagmire. So I will withdraw the motion and ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| the second's approval. The second concurs. So the motion is withdrawn for the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9951)|
| 2:45:59| and we will move to the next agenda item. It will not be on this month's meeting, voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9959)|
| 2:46:03| meeting next month. Point of order. Law director, would a motion to refer be appropriate? It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| on the agenda now, so I don't know that you can vote to... Refer to committee, refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9971)|
| 2:46:25| a body? No, I don't know that that would be proper at this agenda setting meeting. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9985)|
| 2:46:31| something that might, could be done... Next week. At next week. Thank you. I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=9991)|
| 2:46:41| It was withdrawn without a motion to carry forward. Does it carry forward without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10001)|
| 2:46:49| action of this body? If it's withdrawn, this body sets the agenda, so there would be nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10009)|
| 2:46:57| on the agenda for next Monday's meeting, because it's been withdrawn, and therefore it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10017)|
| 2:47:05| by definition, since it sets the agenda, there's nothing to set. So it would not appear in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10025)|
| 2:47:11| this month's voting meeting next week. Okay, but you said something about April. That means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10031)|
| 2:47:17| your intentions are to put it on the agenda next month. Possibly. I'd like to get a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10037)|
| 2:47:25| on what issues there are and see if it, you know, this work of this committee is, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10045)|
| 2:47:32| the work of this law department has been not, this is not in vain. This has been meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10052)|
| 2:47:38| work that has real merit to it, and if there's a way to find a path forward and to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10058)|
| 2:47:44| concerns of both the Merit Council and other commissioners, then, you know, certainly I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| like to have that opportunity. Okay, and I'm still just confused a little bit on why there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10068)|
| 2:47:53| can't be a motion to deny something to move forward to the agenda. Can you speak into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10073)|
| 2:48:01| the mic, I'm sorry. I'm still a little confused why, and this is really not completely related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10081)|
| 2:48:09| to this. This is procedurally for me moving forward. How a motion can be to deny something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10089)|
| 2:48:16| from going forward to a regular meeting and that not be a valid motion. Because this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10096)|
| 2:48:24| this, the motion as I understood it was to deny this ordinance totally, and this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| a voting session. This is only a session to set the agenda. Okay, I thought his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| was to deny moving forward without. Okay, that was unclear to me. I thought it was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10116)|
| 2:48:41| deny the whole thing, but if it's just a motion to deny going forward, that would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10121)|
| 2:48:46| what the vote would have been on the motion anyway. I get that, but a motion to deny moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10126)|
| 2:48:52| forward. That would just be a no vote. That would just be a no vote. Right. You could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10132)|
| 2:49:00| have done that. Is that what you're saying? It's a secondary, I mean if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10140)|
| 2:49:07| make a substitute motion it would be I make a motion that this go forward with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10147)|
| 2:49:14| That would be a substitute. That was the original motion. The original motion was to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10154)|
| 2:49:21| without recommendation. I guess what I'm trying to get at procedurally here is in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10161)|
| 2:49:27| if there's an item that I want to kill at work session, how do I do that, sir? You vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10167)|
| 2:49:34| no. Only the maker of the sponsor of the motion or resolution ordinance can withdraw it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10174)|
| 2:49:41| you could vote no. You just vote no. Just vote no. Yeah, you vote no, not to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10181)|
| 2:49:49| So the motion is withdrawn with a second approval and we will move on to the next item, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10189)|

| 2:50:54| discussion? Commissioner Daley? Hold on just a moment, please, Mr. Chairman. Like my mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10254)|

| 2:51:46| within Knox County, but the training actually benefits all 16 counties. It's a little confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10306)|
| 2:51:51| but District 2 Homeland Security, the office falls under Knox County because we're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| biggest county and we're the host. Thank you, that makes sense. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10315)|

| 2:53:22| $25 million. So we just needed to take an extra month, take a step back and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10402)|

| 2:55:09| Are you with us? I'm here. On the first page of the governmental grant contract, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10509)|
| 2:55:19| that the state is kicking in $16,653. And is that part of the money that's coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10519)|
| 2:55:28| of Nashville? Because you say it is the local match of that in your resolution. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10528)|
| 2:55:34| So normally on FEMA grants, it's $75, $12.5, and $12.5. And so what the state is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10534)|
| 2:55:44| is they're using CARES Act to kick in their half of the FEMA grant. Okay, so they're kicking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10544)|
| 2:55:50| in. Oh, I got you. Okay. Okay. So we're still kicking in 13.5% or whatever? Yeah, whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10550)|
| 2:55:57| the difference is, yeah. Okay. And is this an example of where we hired an outside firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10557)|
| 2:56:03| to do documents for us to make sure that we are going to be compliant with FEMA? Some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10563)|
| 2:56:09| of those expenses could be in there where we hired EY, Ernst & Young, that we're allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10569)|
| 2:56:17| to reimburse for. But that could be a different disaster. Because wasn't the whole idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10577)|
| 2:56:25| getting an outside firm is they were going to review all the documents and guide us correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10585)|
| 2:56:35| so we didn't fill it out? The change on the one related to COVID, which we didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10595)|
| 2:56:42| at the time, was the state hired a consultant as well and gave you that service for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| So we ended up not using our consultant as much. Okay. But we still have them? At some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10609)|
| 2:56:59| expenses, correct. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you, sir. Any further discussion on 805? Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10619)|
| 2:57:07| Smith? Hey, Chris. This is for the floods, right? That's what I was looking at. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10627)|
| 2:57:14| so. I think that's the final one. The floods are not related to CARES Act, so this wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10634)|
| 2:57:36| be anything that would have a third party. I was reading what she put up there. Did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10656)|
| 2:57:44| say that the state is going to be able to pay their 12.5% with COVID money? They were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10664)|
| 2:57:51| on COVID grants. I'd have to look back on this, but the state could have kicked in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10671)|
| 2:57:56| this one as well. Okay. Ultimately, what you're doing is you're approving what we got awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10676)|
| 2:58:04| Basically, FEMA grants are trained because you approve them in the end, not at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10684)|
| 2:58:17| and so it's based off what you got reimbursed for. Is this the point you want to plug Susan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10697)|
| 2:58:24| Susan's great. Susan really does all of our grants and our grant reimbursements, and she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10704)|
| 2:58:30| wonderful. If she says it's right, then it's right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10710)|

| 2:59:40| Yes. After we had met, Mr. Smith and I had met, and we had to discuss this, so one of the questions was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10780)|
| 2:59:50| why are we reading a consent calendar? So, one of my duties was to go check around surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10790)|
| 2:59:59| Blount County, Loudoun County, Rome County, Anderson County, Campbell County, Granger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10799)|

| 3:00:15| So, I caught a hold of Charlie Curtis from the TCCA. Charlie says, why are you doing that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| If it's posted on your website, and you've got a paper copy, which Drew always put paper copies out, that satisfies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10821)|
| 3:00:29| All you need to do is to make a motion to approve the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10829)|

| 3:00:41| Charlie also, Mr. Curtis, Charlie Curtis, said, I will call the lawyer for the TCSA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10841)|
| 3:00:49| and they confirmed that that is correct, that you do not, it's not necessarily necessary to read into the non-consent into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10849)|
| 3:01:00| So, I've always wondered about why we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10860)|
| 3:01:04| I talked to the law director, and I'm getting him information from Charlie on who the lawyer is from the TCSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10864)|
| 3:01:11| So, by hopefully next week, this will be moot, and we can withdraw both of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10871)|
| 3:01:16| because what really was the holdup here is, you know, my intent was to get our associates and anyone here out of here as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10876)|
| 3:01:28| That was the intent. And if we don't have to read a consent calendar, it's going to do the same exact thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10888)|
| 3:01:33| So, that's what I want to do as a non, no recommendation. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10893)|
| 3:01:40| I'm going to chime in here, I don't really have a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10900)|
| 3:01:45| We brought this up, I think, a year and a half ago, give or take, when I was chair of rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10905)|
| 3:01:52| And granted, we have a different law director now, but at the time, the former law director very specifically said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10912)|
| 3:01:58| uh-uh, you've got to read it. And I tried to find the same sort of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10918)|
| 3:02:03| And basically, the former law director said, sorry, you've got to read it, it doesn't matter, too bad, so sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10923)|
| 3:02:10| So, perhaps with some new documentation, our law director might have a different opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| I know we went down this road before, I just don't have the law as to what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10936)|
| 3:02:20| But you were involved in the conversation as well, I think, Commissioner Smith, when we talked about it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10940)|
| 3:02:27| Also, Mr. Chairman, Charlie did say that if it's not in our charter, we didn't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10947)|
| 3:02:36| So, if it was in the charter, which I don't kind of agree with on that one, if I was thinking that I heard him correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10956)|
| 3:02:45| does he say, does your charter say that you have to read the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10965)|
| 3:02:50| And if it doesn't, we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| Commissioner Daley, is that the CTAS attorney or the attorney for the Tennessee County Services Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10975)|
| 3:03:02| Commissioner, I'll have to ask Charlie, but he did say TCSA is who he was getting with, their lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10982)|
| 3:03:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10990)|
| 3:03:13| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| So, the substitute motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Daley, with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=10996)|
| 3:03:23| Director Book, do you want to wait and chime in next week, or do you want to jump in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| Well, it's late. I'll just chime in if I need to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11008)|
| 3:03:31| But, you know, if that's something that can be done, I don't have a problem with it whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11011)|
| 3:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| The motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11018)|
| 3:03:42| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11024)|
| 3:03:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11025)|
| 3:03:47| Next item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| Item number 42, Resolution 904, is amending the Knox County Commission Rules, Rule 1, Section B, Entitled Order of Business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11030)|
| 3:04:01| to reverse the order of Item N, Resolutions, General Government Consent Calendar, and Resolutions not on the General Government Consent Calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11041)|
| 3:04:08| so that Resolutions not on the General Consent Calendar will be heard before the General Government Consent Calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11048)|
| 3:04:16| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11058)|
| 3:04:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| Commissioner Busse with a motion to move forward without recommendation, seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11062)|
| 3:04:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11071)|
| 3:04:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11072)|
| 3:04:33| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11073)|
| 3:04:34| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11074)|
| 3:04:37| Item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11077)|
| 3:04:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| Discussion item regarding litter pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| I wanted to, lost a lot of people by now, but I got a bunch of faxes and emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11086)|
| 3:04:52| I know Commissioner Daley has been tackling this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11092)|
| 3:04:56| I kind of just wanted to reach out to Mr. Hammond, Clerk Hammond, about when are we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11096)|
| 3:05:04| when are the judges going to be able to start sentencing people back to litter and patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| and when does the engineering department at that point in time feel like they can take on that litter crew that we used to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11109)|
| 3:05:17| and are there, can we look at, in the budget for next year, maybe having a permanent litter crew going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11117)|
| 3:05:24| like a two-man truck team under our waste division, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11124)|
| 3:05:29| I wanted to just bring up a couple ideas and throw them out there and just see what everybody thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11129)|
| 3:05:32| I know it's an ongoing issue and it's becoming more and more prevalent since we haven't been able to do the normal litter crew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11132)|
| 3:05:40| over the last year with all the COVID issues going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11140)|
| 3:05:43| So I just wanted to kind of bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| I have a question for Director Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| I think he's hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11154)|
| 3:05:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11157)|
| 3:06:01| Jim, if you want to go ahead and answer Commissioner Ward's questions, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11161)|
| 3:06:06| And I can speak to broad specifics, but Drew Thurman's here with the Director of Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11166)|
| 3:06:11| He can really get into the great details, but I'll let Chris speak and then I'll be happy to address anything as well as Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11171)|
| 3:06:22| Hey, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11182)|
| 3:06:25| We've talked a lot about COVID money tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11185)|
| 3:06:30| Due to the situation COBA has put on our courts and what it's done with our prison crews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11190)|
| 3:06:39| is this an area that we can use some one-time money from COVID relief to address some of the issues we have with litter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11199)|
| 3:06:48| I know it's a one-time spend, but is that some way we can use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| It's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11213)|
| 3:06:55| I'm not trying to get a cop out, but it's really going to be based off guidance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| And so if they come back and say it's an allowable expense or if they don't and we ask the question and they say, yes, you can use it, then we can use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11220)|
| 3:07:10| I think you can make the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11232)|
| 3:07:13| I think you can make the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| But we have to make sure that they do say that it's an allowable expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11235)|
| 3:07:20| I can tell you that these two guys, when we first was looking to get reimbursed for expenses through the CARES Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11240)|
| 3:07:30| we looked at it because we knew that people were going to the convenience centers more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11250)|
| 3:07:35| so we were going to try to get reimbursed for that expense, but it was small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11255)|
| 3:07:40| We'd chosen not to even try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| It was so small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11263)|
| 3:07:44| But for your point from a litter standpoint, I think we can make that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11264)|
| 3:07:49| I bet you that won't be in the guidance, but I think it's a question that we can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11269)|
| 3:07:54| If we can show that there was revenue and resources that were normally attributed to it that we weren't able to have because of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11274)|
| 3:08:01| maybe we can make that rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| The second question is, moving forward as Commissioner Ward has spoke of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11284)|
| 3:08:11| trying to put something in the budget and making this a permanent program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11291)|
| 3:08:19| I, for one, have noticed litter in both the city and the county being really bad here lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11299)|
| 3:08:25| And, again, thank you, Commissioner Daley, for shining light on this for as long as you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11305)|
| 3:08:32| And it has detrimental impacts upon the image of our city and our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11312)|
| 3:08:39| Is there any way we can tie this to tourism moving forward and maybe use some hotel-motel tax money for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11319)|
| 3:08:47| The mayor has asked that exact question, so we're going to see if we can tie that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11327)|
| 3:08:53| Right now, hotel-motel tax is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11333)|
| 3:08:58| We know that can be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| We know that can be, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| I think it's a question that I think you can directly tie tourism to the cleanliness of your county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11343)|
| 3:09:12| Your image is everything when it comes to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| And so I think we can ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11355)|
| 3:09:19| I know that we currently have five full-time employees that do litter control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11359)|
| 3:09:27| Jim has made the request for an additional one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| And so it's not that we're not trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11370)|
| 3:09:36| I think it's just worse right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11376)|
| 3:09:41| But I think your question is related to federal money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11381)|
| 3:09:46| I think we just have to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11386)|
| 3:09:48| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11388)|
| 3:09:50| Well, I think moving forward we need to address this somehow before it does become a reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11390)|
| 3:09:57| and an image problem for Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11400)|
| 3:10:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11403)|
| 3:10:04| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11404)|
| 3:10:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11406)|
| 3:10:10| Been working on this now starting my fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11410)|
| 3:10:15| History for the new commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11415)|
| 3:10:18| Used to the DUI law was that they spent 24 hours on litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11418)|
| 3:10:25| That was changed a few years back because the smaller counties did not have a solid waste department like we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11425)|
| 3:10:31| So they called it an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11431)|
| 3:10:34| So the state legislature turned it into an option for the judges to send us DUIs to litter pickup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11434)|
| 3:10:42| which our judges are not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| Before the change, you would see the offenders every day, just basically about every day out picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11445)|
| 3:10:52| They used to have DUI on their vest, and they got that taken off because it hurt their feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11452)|
| 3:10:59| because it had the I'm a drunk driver on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| So they got their feelings hurt, and they had to go with just an orange vest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11461)|
| 3:11:06| This is some of the reports that Drew gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11466)|
| 3:11:12| DUI litter pickup days before the change was 1,452 on the average,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11472)|
| 3:11:19| or 8,712 hours of DUIs out picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11479)|
| 3:11:25| Two years afterwards, because of the change, we were down to 96 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11485)|
| 3:11:31| and in 2020, of course, it was zero because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| COVID made the big effect because we're not sending anyone out there to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11494)|
| 3:11:39| So we went from 1,400 average days, 8,000 to 9,000 hours to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11499)|
| 3:11:46| Miles of road picked up was 1,052 this year, or 2019, I think it was around 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11506)|
| 3:11:54| Number of dumps cleaned, 323.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11514)|
| 3:11:57| Two years later, we were down to 150, and now we're down to basically zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| Tons of trash collected was 118.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11522)|
| 3:12:06| It was less than 30 two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| We could recycle items in tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| We were recycling 40 tons of recyclable items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11531)|
| 3:12:15| Now it was less than two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| It was down to four tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| More likely zero now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11539)|
| 3:12:22| As a request, I asked back in 2017's budget, I believe 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11542)|
| 3:12:27| I requested Mayor Burchett to add two positions to the Solid Waste Department for litter pickup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11547)|
| 3:12:33| and he added those two positions, and I think we added another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11553)|
| 3:12:36| We're up to five, right, Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11558)|
| 3:12:40| Offenders, at that point in time when the judges were sentencing offenders to probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11560)|
| 3:12:46| they would show up at Solid Waste, pay a fee of $46.20 per day that they had to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11566)|
| 3:12:53| That was a yearly income of $67,082.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11573)|
| 3:12:57| Two years later, it was down to $4,435 because the judges are not sentencing DUIs to litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11577)|
| 3:13:06| The judges, you'll catch our reoccurring theme here, judges need to sentence DUIs to litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11586)|
| 3:13:14| They need to put, not only do they need to sentence DUIs, but anybody that's got a misdemeanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11594)|
| 3:13:20| they need to sentence them to litter pickup too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11600)|
| 3:13:22| They have that authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11602)|
| 3:13:25| Representative Roger Kane and I worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11605)|
| 3:13:28| We got an AG's opinion that stated that judges may require persons convicted of DUI to pick up litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11608)|
| 3:13:35| PCA 55-10-402.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| The statute gives judges the discretion to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11618)|
| 3:13:42| Judges are not doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11622)|
| 3:13:45| Our Solid Waste Department can handle around 30 to 35, Drew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11625)|
| 3:13:52| You can just state your name and department for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| This is Drew Thurman, Director of Solid Waste, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11634)|
| 3:13:57| What was the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| You can handle around 30 to 35 per bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| You know, we used to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| We used to have a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11644)|
| 3:14:05| I would say any more than tens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11645)|
| 3:14:09| We have two vans and a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| So if you have two 12, 13 passenger vans and a truck, we would have enough to take out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| If we had every vehicle out that's devoted to litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11657)|
| 3:14:20| So we can do 20, 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11660)|
| 3:14:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| This number here, hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11665)|
| 3:14:27| I base this on 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11667)|
| 3:14:29| The average probationer would spend about six to eight hours a day, 200 hours per day, times five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11669)|
| 3:14:39| It's 1,000 hours per week, and ain't no telling how many roads that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11679)|
| 3:14:43| That's a lot of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11683)|
| 3:14:44| Not doing this because the judges are not sentencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11684)|
| 3:14:49| Attorney General Allen, I want to give her a shout out, and Assistant Sam Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11689)|
| 3:14:56| We worked together to implement a DUI offender pleading down program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11696)|
| 3:15:01| that if you're caught DUI and you want to plead it down, you're sentenced to 24 hours of litter pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11701)|
| 3:15:07| And she has been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| I would love to see that extended to misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11709)|
| 3:15:13| Can you imagine in November, December, we had 500, 600 shoplifters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11713)|
| 3:15:19| If those shoplifters were sentenced to 24 hours of litter pickup, how much roads would be cleaned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11719)|
| 3:15:24| I promise you this, you shoplift that $35 video game or that T-shirt or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11724)|
| 3:15:31| and you pick up three days of litter, you ain't shoplifting no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11731)|
| 3:15:35| It ain't happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| Thank you, Attorney General and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| Hopefully, like I say, this could be back in the plea bargain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11739)|
| 3:15:43| and we can extend it, we can do the $46.20 or more fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| when they come to see Drew to go out and pick up the litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| Knox County needs an environmental judge or a litter court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11752)|
| 3:15:58| That will take offense of the littering and the legal dumping seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11758)|
| 3:16:04| In the 2022 budget, I've asked for one environmental officer under the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11764)|
| 3:16:09| to be placed in the Coast Department to investigate and cite offenders to such a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11769)|

| 3:16:20| in the Knox County Ordinance to mirror the State Litter Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11780)|
| 3:16:25| which is a lot stronger than our Knox County Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| And I'm going to give you some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| Remember, her ordinance is only $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11789)|

| 3:16:48| Drew, I'm going to request that we have a Cover Your Load sign that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| that bond PC law is $500 fine plus court cost underneath that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11812)|
| 3:16:59| because hopefully we'll get an environmental officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| and we can pay for him just at Johnson Beer Convenience Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210322?start=11821)|
