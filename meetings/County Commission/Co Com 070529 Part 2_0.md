| 0:10:39| And to get five dwelling units per acre, they would have to be attached, but there is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| It could be two and a half to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| It's kind of what we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| So what do you plan to build there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It would be single attached, but we haven't submitted the concept plan for the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=652)|

| 0:14:43| There is some planned residential zoning at one to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| The staff recommended denial of this request, and the planning commission concurred with that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=888)|
| 0:14:57| The property, in looking at this request and looking at the surrounding area of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| we felt like it was not suited for commercial development as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| It does extend back into a developed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Some of them have two or three large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| There are several other subdivided lots on Apache leading back into Mountain, excuse me, Mount Air Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:29| There is already a developing, and we believe we had some recent rezoning in the area back to the southwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=929)|
| 0:15:37| at Rutledge Pike and Ellis Town Road where you do have an appropriate commercial node developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| We feel that makes much more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| If you rezone this property, then you pretty much have extended the possibility for extending commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| at Rutledge Pike going to the northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| There is, as I mentioned, there is a commercial node developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| and we feel like this is where the commercial development in this particular area should be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| With those thoughts and comments in mind, the planning commission voted, I believe, 11-0 in both cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| to deny both the planning amendment request and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| There was opposition at the NBC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Commissioner Ballard, did you get your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| In this particular zoning here, I have been contacted by both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| I'm going to have to, I'm a little bit tainted in that I had a relative buy into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| I can't truly be a neutral, and I wouldn't want to do anything to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| But in speaking for the citizens that live there and around it, it's a typical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| Nobody wants a dump or something sitting in their front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| I have talked to John Storey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| John Storey is saying that he would like that for probably a service station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| that he's willing to work with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| But I believe at this time there's not, since there's not a community sort of group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| anybody for him to really work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| If I've misstated that, then as you come to the microphone, then please plead your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| But I'm going to have to step out of this since I do have a, actually my daughter that has bought into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| I'm going to let some other commissioners talk to them and tell them what their options could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:51| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Okay, Mr. Storey, I guess you can go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| You'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| I'm John Storey, 6904 Mount Royal Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| I'm Charles Storey, 7748 Devonshire Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| And you've got five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Okay, we own the property that is industrial, that borders this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| And what we wanted to do in rezoning this, of course, was for business, commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| And also we were going for the subdivision itself, we were going to put a buffer of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| so that they could buffer themselves from the commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| From our property, our industrial property, going back down to the county line on Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:38| there's 54 commercial and industrial sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| Five home sites border Rutledge Pike versus the 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| That's our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We've come, we've came and rezoned our property from a piece of agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| It was producing roughly $600 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Now it's producing in excess of $20 million a year in taxable income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Something to be considered by the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| We're not going to go in and extend our trucking company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| It's going to be a clean operation, a commercial operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| And we will buffer with trees and fence the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1151)|
| 0:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you, Mr. Storey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Okay, opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| And, John, you all have three minutes to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| I'm Leonard Crook, 2001 Mount Air Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| and our biggest contention is the traffic problem we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| On the opposite side of Rutledge Pike, there's a subdivision going in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and all the traffic coming out of it will have to come down Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| and do a U-turn right across from it to go back into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| So, and then if we put a business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| and then us trying to come out of our subdivision is going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| a tremendous traffic problem right at that little intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| There's no traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| There's no stop signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| It's four lanes with an island there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| So the traffic problem is going to be an initial problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| The other thing, of course, is who wants, after a hard day's work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| to go into their backyard and have a gas station right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| with the noise, the lights, the smells from oil and gas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| and security issues and everything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| I took a petition up, and everybody in our subdivision signed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and I've sent copies in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| So our request is that you deny this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| based on our lifestyle and protecting our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| My name is John Hughes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I'm here to represent my son and his family of property in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| and for all the reasons stated, we'd just like to have it denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| They live on the Rutledge bike side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| There's trees there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| It doesn't buffer noise or light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| I don't think it would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| adding a tree buffer to this gas station would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| between them and their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| Kent Phillips, 1908 Mount Air Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| I'm also opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Have two small children that ride their bicycles on Mount Air Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| The only way to get into that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| or out of that subdivision is on Apache Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| and we do not need commercial development at that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| The last commercial development along there is the industrial area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| that Mr. Storey owns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| and there's also a trucking firm that is adjacent to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| but then we need a buffer for the entrance to our subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| and we just do not need this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| and the extra traffic and the possible crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| and all the other things that might go along with having that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| There's also a convenience store a half a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| in both directions on Rutledge Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| and, you know, we don't need anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| I'm Faye Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1323)|

| 0:22:08| We also own the lot that goes to Apache Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| the other side where he's talking about putting the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| We do not need that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| We have enough traffic through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| We've had two wrecks right there in the last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| and we don't need any more traffic through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| We also have another new family that's moved in our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| that has a small child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| and I don't think these children need the fumes and gas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| and all this stuff from these trucks that's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| I live at 2012 Mount Air Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| and I am objected to this because of the security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| the lights, the noise, and the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1374)|

| 0:23:00| and we're against the rezoning for all the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| that have already been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1383)|

| 0:23:09| and my wife and I both object to this new rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| I guess, John, you've got three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Rebuttal, if you've heard anything you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Number one, we have been contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| by three different oil companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| and also contacted, as far as the traffic is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| by a storage lot, which would require commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| have an office there fenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| something else we're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| If it is so objective to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Now, as far as the turning is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| it's already been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| by the Tennessee Department of Highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| that the transportation, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| that the entire turn lane there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| from Apache down to Ellistown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| will be turned into one turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| So everyone will not be turning in from Apache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Does anyone from the opposition wish to say anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| Under current 2001 Mount Air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| we haven't been given a final on that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| But also, if this is rezoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| there's no guarantee what's going to go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| So this is going to be an ongoing problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| It should be zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| And if they want to make profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| they could put nice houses on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| and sell them at a profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| as opposed to putting commercial in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| This is for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Looking at the map here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| are you going to have your entrance on Apache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| or are you going to come off Rutledge Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| What's your proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| With the oil companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| we would be coming off of Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| With the applicant or the gentleman and company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| that has applied to us to put a storage yard there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| for repossession of cars, boats, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| it would be coming off of Rutledge Pike also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| And he's going to keep the home that's on there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| He will be going to that, making that his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| That will be the only entrance off of Apache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| is going into his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So you're having more than one business on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| No, no, just one business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| But he wants to lease the entire piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| with the two buildings that are on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| a home and a storage building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| We don't have any topos on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| so I don't know what the residents are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| Are they looking down on you or are you looking down on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Actually, they're looking down on us through trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1544)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Commissioner Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| This is for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I think I understood what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| The turn will actually be off Rutledge Pike, not onto Apache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| The only turn off of Apache would be into his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| into an office complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| And I say office complex, an office building with a storage building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| And this is for Buzz or Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Have you all looked at the traffic out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| What's going in across the road, subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| There's a significant subdivision on the southeast corner of Rutledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| and Ellis Town that has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| I don't recall the number of units, but it's a couple of hundred at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| A hundred and forty-four to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| Seems right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| But you all saw no problem with line of sight distance or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| The exit coming out of that subdivision is okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| I would expect that they would seek approval from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| to create another median opening that would align with their entry road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| There is enough room between the existing one at Apache| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| and Ellis Town to create another median opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| So the scenario about U-turns may or may not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| May or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| And one of the gentlemen, I think, said you sent a petition in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:39| I mailed 20 copies of the petition, and they were received on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| So hopefully you all received a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| But I have the original here I can pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| Buzz, will you restate MPC's position on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| In this area, you have at the intersection of Ellis Town and Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| you have a developing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| Any kind of planning policy would pretty much state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| that's an appropriate location for commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| That's the ideal is to try to get it focused where you do have major roads crossing each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| On the northeast quadrant, you have the large industrial track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| which I believe is owned by the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| You develop this site, which we feel is an intrusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| albeit it may not be a recognizable part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| But it is intruding into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Access, there would be access issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| We feel even if only the office building is accessed onto Apache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| that presents a problem for that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| You identify this for commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| then you're essentially creating some pressure, possibly other commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| to go on out Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Well, we've got a good developing node at the intersection of Ellis Town and Rutledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| and we feel like that's where the commercial development should be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| So the vote was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Eleven to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| And so the staff opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| The vote was 11 to zero against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| And further, if this were to happen, it would effectively amend the northeast county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| The driveway onto Apache, if you move that driveway out onto Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and you close that Apache entrance, would that help your neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| If you closed your entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| You asked me to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| If you closed your entrance on Apache and only used one entrance onto Rutledge from Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| That would be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| It wouldn't be a problem for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| Would that leave any of the concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| If they don't come off of Apache, if they come off of Rutledge, that wouldn't help any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| Ma'am, you're going to have to come down to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| because we need to record this in case there's litigation after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| If anybody wants to speak to it, you can come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| That is our only way in and out of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I've been there 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| The road come in behind our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| They split the farm that was behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| Give us your name, too, so we can have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| I'm Faye Morgan, 1909 Mount Air Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Ms. Morgan, we weren't talking about closing Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| We were talking about Mr. Storey not having a driveway off of Apache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| People would come in straight off of Rutledge Pike, which should alleviate some of the traffic on Apache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| But he was also saying about the office building that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| There's a double-wide mobile home there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| And there's a barn there on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| So the front part of that prime property is what he's wanting to develop, and we don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| My name is Tammy Morgan, 2016 Mount Air Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| We're not just opposed to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It's the lights, the fumes, everything that would come with a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| I mean, we have no way in and out except past it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| Buzz, how can they, if these guys are saying that they'll move their driveway so it doesn't affect Apache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:08| do we need to put something where we hold them to that if this is approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| How would we go about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| You could, in our opinion, you could do that as a condition of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Sir, could I add that we already have a drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| We own the property that's next to this property now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| It's industrial property that is a trucking company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and we have that driveway already existing off of Rutledge Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| So it would be no problem whatsoever to come off of Rutledge Pike and not bother Apache Trail at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| I think we've taken care of the Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| We can do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| Can you address the problems they have about the smell, the gasoline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| This is the point I was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I've been contacted by three oil companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| but also contacted by this other gentleman who lived there originally, and I bought the home from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| I bought the property from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| He had a horse farm there, and he wants to come back and move his business there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| which is nothing more than a storage lot for cars, RVs, and boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| And that's why I had offered to put a buffer of trees there so that they wouldn't have to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| There won't be a fence around the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| There won't be a lot of traffic in and out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| And I will lease it to him if they're so opposed to a service station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| So there's not going to be a service station?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| If it's, you know, so much opposition and bother these people, I'll be a good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| and I'll lease it to someone that won't have the bright lights in the big city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Buzz, does MPC, can they go and specify what species of trees that they put?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| I mean, there's different types of trees you can put, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| some really buffer really good and some aren't worth a flip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Can you all offer any if this was to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| Certainly, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| We couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Obviously, we can't offer them today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| We don't have our list and don't have it, but we could offer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Chairman, I'm ready to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| I think they've tried to be a good neighbor and work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| And, Buzz, what was that that we need to make the amendment to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| If I heard you correctly, and please correct me if I didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| I understood that you wanted to eliminate any possibility of access to Apache Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2073)|

| 0:34:39| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a substitute motion to deny as per MPC a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2079)|

| 0:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Mr. Chairman, there is some mention of a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Are you willing to put up some fence in an appropriate place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| The gentleman that we can lease it to, other than the service station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| we'll have a fence around it, and we will put the trees in ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| Commissioner Lugar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Buzz, is there another zoning that Mr. Storey could go with to lease for that type of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| for storage other than commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I think he's pretty much got to have commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| We've got a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I guess it's to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Deny the appeal per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2155)|

| 0:38:02| with the property owner. Some of my colleagues here are really fond of trees, so what I thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:09| since he's already mentioned putting a buffer of trees in, would you be willing to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| to planting 20% of this property in trees? I would do that, that would be no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2293)|

| 0:38:38| it's better to deny the entire thing and respect the neighborhood and respect the NPC. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=2318)|

| 0:56:28| manager for the Community Alternatives to Prison at 1808 North Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| I think there was some confusion in the prior meetings. All the funds for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| lease have already been approved in the resolution for our program grant. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| all state funds. It comes from the state. There's no matching funds, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| not even included in the county budget as far as. How much is the grant, by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| way? Six hundred and each year we get $610,910 for three years. Okay. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:14| any more questions? Could you give a description of some of the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| We are a supervision program for nonviolent felony offenders. We provide A&D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| groups, mental health groups. We have people that help them with education, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| vocational. For those that are on disability, we probably just, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| babysit them. They're at our office from 9 to 12 or 2.30 Monday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:53| Is this the second year? Are you in your second year, third year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| Actually, our program has been in existence since 86. So we're in our 22nd. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:09| as far as grants go, it's about as stable as you can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| But this grant was for a three-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Yes, we get them in three-year increments. So this is the start of another three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| Have you had any security problems or problems with the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| No, not really. And we are across from the Country Table Restaurant. It's a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3507)|

| 0:58:40| The day that the double murder happened, I was actually working all day at that office that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:48| And that's caused me more concern than any of my people. I mean, it's not the greatest of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3528)|
| 0:59:00| but for what we do, it's a perfect location. It's easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| The bus stops right in front of our door. And, I mean, we love it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| We were on Knoxville College campus, and we moved from there over to here, and it's just been like heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| Okay. Is there any more questions? Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| I made a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Okay. Any more discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| Opposed, no. And the ayes have it. Motion passes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3573)|

| 0:59:44| This is to approve a change order with APAC in the amount of $967,316.28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:53| to the Dutchtown Road Improvement Project Phase 1 and extending the completion date 14 months from the notice to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3593)|
| 1:00:05| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 to approve with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| I don't remember what the amendment is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| I believe the amendment was for John to look at the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| It might have been. I know we had discussions about taking a look at how we award contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| and I talked to Hugh Holt about weighting the past performance with a greater emphasis than what it's currently being now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:38| I'm not sure if that was the amendment or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I believe that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Thanks, Grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| Okay. Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I live very near there and, in fact, voted to authorize this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| It just didn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| I don't really like what we have to do, but I think it is the best recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| and it needs to get done because we made those citizens a promise down there to take care of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| and they're still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| So I would move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Mr. Chairman, I would like to move an amendment, and that is to add another paragraph saying it being further resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| Unless all utility problems on this project are resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| the county commission intends to hold a hearing about such problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| including commission subpoena power regarding the relevant utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| My reason for suggesting this amendment is we need to hold the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| especially the tardy ones, accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| And if we suggest that we can hold a hearing, use our subpoena power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| and drag them in there to answer questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| that may be a way to push the one utility or two utilities that are holding this up and adding extra cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:58| I think I could sort of answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| Well, I made an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Let's see if the guy gets a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Who made the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| We didn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Now my amendment is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| No, I'm seconding Commissioner Leuthold's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Unless we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| Commissioner Frank Leuthold made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Commissioner Craig Leuthold seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Now my amendment, which I've already read, is in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| And if I get a second, we discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I'm going to go ahead and second it because I've got some questions myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Go ahead, Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| You know, we're talking, if there's any reasons, there's a million dollars worth of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| Not only this, but I think $100,000 that will be wiped away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| And, you know, the more that I know Bruce, the more I realize what a hard job he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| And we've got a proven contractor on the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| But, look, guys, Knox County is saying we're not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| Our proven contractor says we're not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| Now, do we stop here and pay the million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Or do we do sort of like, I don't, maybe I'm not smart enough to understand the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| but I don't know where Mark's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| And we hear that we're going to do better on the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Or do contractors learn, well, gosh, it's going to be 18 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| We give 18 months notice, they're into it for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| They have to back away from that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| We're the ones that are paying the million dollars for our guys not being at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| My thought is AT&T, Bell South, comes knocking at our door and asks us to vote for their Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3831)|
| 1:04:01| And should we not bring them in here and ask them, where's the flow chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| There's so many different people out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Whether we approve it or not, should we still not bring them in and ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| if the mayor calls you, we'll give you 18 months notice, we're a year into the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Why in the world, you know, they're carrying airline, that's commerce, they're making money off of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| Why can't we have them come in here and ask them why it's taking so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| We're talking a million dollars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| We're talking a lot less on the upcoming budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| We're going to hold people to a high standard in accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| So why don't we open up our commission powers, maybe for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| and subpoena in Bell South or Internal Mill Mows and find out why they're not being good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| or anybody else that's on that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| You tell me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| I understood you to say that Bell South and KUB operated pretty well with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| In this particular instance, KUB operated very well with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| West Knox Utility did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Bell South was ended up being the one, the last set of poles we had out there was Bell South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| We had the major problem with poles being in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| It was Bell South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| But Comcast has really been the hold up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| And Comcast participated in that to the extent that Bell South owned the poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| but Comcast's equipment is hanging on those poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| And as I stated previously, we had nine different utilities out there on this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| Well, Commissioner Hammond is our cable TV chairman there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| and we proposed at the finance meeting that on a deadline like the 18 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| that you all anticipated this job to be done in, anything with the cable TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| we're going to try to put it in their contract that they'll be fined $500 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| And Commissioner Hammond assists us with the final relocation of Comcast equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| That's about the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| I don't know how we can do anything with KUB, Bell South and them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Well, Commissioner Hammond's recommendation or motion in this particular instance I think is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| In the future, if we run into situations that we feel like a utility is being uncooperative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| or stonewall is dragging or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| I will certainly bring it to this commission's attention because, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| we have exhausted all our means of persuasion as to getting these utilities relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| You all, on the other hand, may have some other avenues you might want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| But we will certainly bring it to your attention in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| Bruce, what did we do wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| How are we at fault?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| How is Knox County at fault and liable for a million dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:53| Knox County is not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Let me state this very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Knox County is not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| I guess our recommendation is based on the alternative recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:04| My alternative recommendation would be is that we would have to cancel the contract with APAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| pursue their performance bond, and essentially hire another contractor for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| That may sound very simple as I explain it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| but what it does entail is it requires the county to go back out, resurvey the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| We have to quantify the work that has been done and has not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| We would then have to rebid the project and award it to a new contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| The very minimum length of time that would take would be four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| During this construction season, potentially that could delay this project another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| We debated this back and forth as to what we thought the best recommendation would be in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| and we think this is the best recommendation given the alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| But Knox County is not at fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| Our contract clearly stipulates, in our opinion, that it is the contractor, APAC's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| responsibility to coordinate the relocation of those utilities and factor that timetable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| and expense into their bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| And that's clearly in our contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| I guess what we're looking at is the alternative of pursuing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| We just don't feel that's going to be in everyone's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And when I mean everyone, I'm talking about Knox County and the residents that live on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Bruce, as a normal course of business, would APAC call you or somebody and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:29| these folks aren't doing what they're supposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| Yeah, I think very clearly from the get-go it was clear that utilities was going to be a huge issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| and it delayed the project throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| There was communication between us and APAC to the extent that they knew that we were concerned about this deadline coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:47| They also were, and I don't want to be the spokesperson for APAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| but I do know they were meeting with these utilities to get them to a timetable to get these utilities relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| But when it was all said and done, it just delayed the project to this extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| So, you know, you're not under any obligation, as you well know, to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| I'm just stating that the alternative is no less than a four-month delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| and that's our most optimistic estimate in regards to the delay of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4154)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| We got a letter from Commissioner Hammond here stating that he had contacted Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| Their equipment was removed May 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| The remaining pigtail on one of the poles belonging to LCUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| Are you familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Commissioner Hammond mentioned that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| We'll run that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| The pole that's out there right now, I use that kind of as more of an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| It's not a serious impediment to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| That's not the pole that's held us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| There was a series of poles that were in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| This just happens to be the last pole, but I bring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| The only reason I brought that to everyone's attention is because, you know, as I'm speaking today, that pole is still sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| Now, there may be some confusion as to who owns the pole, but if there's no equipment on the pole, I'll knock the pole down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| That's not going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| And, Mr. Law Director, is there any recourse for this body when this, after we approve this million dollars to finish this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:24| do we have any recourse going back on this company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| On the utility companies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| Or the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| I was looking at APAC, but or the utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| I mean, for holding this project up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| I mean, what you're doing, basically, you're giving them X dollars more to perform the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| So, basically, if you approve of that, you're, I think, giving them a green light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| You may be, although I would be hesitant to say that you're waiving any right of action that you may have against APAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:58| It may send that signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| It may send that signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Well, can we, on this we're voting on then, can we do an amendment not releasing APAC from any liabilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| Well, they're not released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| I mean, on paper, certainly, they're not released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| We're not waiving any rights of action that we may otherwise have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| But they made a specific request for, you know, X dollars more to complete the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| That's been approved by Bruce and the engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| And so, as far as anything up to that amount, I would say that we would have a tough time in litigating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:45| If we're going to pull the plug, the time to pull the plug is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| As you know, this project has been going on for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And the delay has been several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| And as Commissioner Frank Luthol mentioned, we made a promise to those folks that we were going to improve that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| The traffic count on that road is going up almost every day because it's becoming a thoroughfare from Cedar Bluff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Pellissippi Parkway and to Lovell Road and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| So the citizens there deserve to have this road completed in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| And as Bruce mentioned, to not do so is going to result in months and months delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| which means that that road is just going to stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| And if you've driven on Dutchtown, you know that it's not a very pleasant road to drive on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| With regards to the million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| I don't like the idea of giving an extra million dollars for something that should have been done a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| But I think Commissioner Harmon does make some good remarks in that Bruce used us in the court of public opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:48| because I don't think the utility companies want a county commission meeting to pass a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| or bring them down here to say, why are you costing the citizens an extra million dollars because you won't move a pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| I can attest from personal experience that this is not fun coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Tell them that and tell them that we will not hesitate to bring them down here in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Commissioner Luthol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| Commissioner Mark Harmon, does your amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| are you asking for them to come down over this particular item now or just in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:22| What it says is that unless utility problems on this project are resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| county commission intends to hold a hearing on such problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| including commission's subpoena power regarding the relevant utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| So you're just talking about this project, this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| I mean, I'm not establishing a broader policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| I'm responding to what is a extensive delay on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| Is there a time limit involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| I mean, evidently there's just one pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| So in Bruce's saying that, he doesn't see that as a hindrance at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| But, I mean, I agree with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| I just figured that this might be an extra push to make sure that one pole is out of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| and we get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4443)|
| 1:14:05| You may not think it's a needed extra push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| You may think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| But I decided to offer it for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| Oh, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I think it's something that we ought to do in the future with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| And I was wondering if you just wanted to attach it to this project or future projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| because I could see this happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| But we could talk about that another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| Yeah, I think that's a broader policy question, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Mr. Harmon, as your reference is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| that if there's any utility that's now standing in the way from this point forward hindrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4480)|
| 1:14:47| we would do this or call back why it was delayed already or delayed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| From this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| If that's the point, I'll make it part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| I'll accept it as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Jerry, I'm agreeing with Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| Try it for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| You might like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Mr. Chairman, just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Mr. Law Director and Bruce, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| we might even look at making this part of some language in your contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| It sounds to me that's what it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| How do you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Given you all, first of all, I wasn't aware you had the ability to actually subpoena people down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| Since we're aware of that, we'll certainly utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I think the best thing for us to do is when we have a project, certainly in your all's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| when we're having these kind of difficulties, we'll get you all spun up to speak quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| and decide in some situations whether it's appropriate to bring these individuals down here to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| You know, certainly there are legitimate explanations as to why there are delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| and there may be some in this regard, but this has gone on for way too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| The gentleman from APAC is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Does he have any opposition to that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:13| Gary Laughlin with APAC Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| In fact, we would highly endorse this idea that you have come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| You all will be one of the first bodies that are willing to take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| This is a continuing issue with any roadway that you want to improve within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| Put whatever language you want to in our contract, but we're in favor of this, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:45| In some of the committee discussions, I'll repeat what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| As a company, we have a commitment to build this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| Our main objective is to be safe, to complete the work for Knox County, and to move on with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4613)|
| 1:17:05| You may look at this as a losing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| If Knox County is a loser, APAC is a bigger loser in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:18| We not only lost time, we will spend more money than Knox County pays us, even with this additional change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Mike Hammond, did you say that you were looking into fines for Comcast now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| At our next cable TV committee, we're going to bring that up with our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| We're negotiating a new contract with Comcast to see if perhaps that can be part of the language of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| And under the amended motion that's on the floor, it just goes from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| But aren't you all interested in bringing in Comcast bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| And just ask them why, after 18 months notice and 30 months that they can't move the poll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4675)|

| 1:19:54| John, does that money have to do with this budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| As I recall, this does have matching funds in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| I think that was disclosed during the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| That's the reason why it wasn't approved in intergovernmental, but you didn't know that in finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| Otherwise, it would have been appropriate to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| So what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| Well, if you want to keep the same action that you did last time, you will want to defer this along with the other budget items as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| If it doesn't do any harm, we can take that one and the next one, which is the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| and move it to that same recessed per meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| Is 607 the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Shall we take 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| No, the other ones, 5 and 6, were approved because it has no local funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| 3, 4, and 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4849)|

| 1:21:20| Were they not approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4880)|

| 1:21:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| We have spoken with Sheriff Jones just today about doing the same background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| checks on our officials that we do for our coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| and they have agreed graciously to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| At the same time, Sheriff and the department is going to look at working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| TBI to do another level of search as well and try to work on a good price there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| So we think this is a good first step of raising the bar in terms of how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| check folks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| And we're still going to pursue the idea of going to a national check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| but we think there are probably some ways we can do that without having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| increase the fees an exorbitant amount right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| I'll move to approve, with the language adding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| that these officials have a background check by the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=4961)|

| 1:23:22| John, I think we talked about having a committee just to having a policy, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| And that's what I'm going to do is I'm going to get hooked up with probably like Bill Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| and Larry Martin and try to hammer something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5014)|

| 1:25:03| It doesn't bother me in the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| But I just don't believe that we need to be giving these people any lip service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| We don't need to be discussing this at a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| I think we had a motion to approve, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| With the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5117)|
| 1:25:18| You need to do a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| I'll make that a substitute motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Seconded by Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Well, I guess your substitute motion is just a withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Lee, I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| I would not have put this on the agenda, but it was put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| And after it was put there, we had no choice but to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| And we added some language, you know, that showed our respect for the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| But at this point, I mean, these folks have made threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| You know, I do not want to send them the message that they can make a few threats and that we'll back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| I really think that this commission needs to stand firm in passing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| because at this point, you know, like I said, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I would not have brought it up because I wouldn't want their names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| the names of their organizations to have the honor of being mentioned in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| But it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| And at that point, we had to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| And now, especially in light of the threats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| I think we need to pass this thing and send these folks a strong message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| You know, we're not putting up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| I'm going to agree with Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| I said that in committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| And if we continue just to give them free press, that's what they like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| That's why I passed in committee, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Two, if you'll notice, what we did in the committee meeting was gave them at least a quarter page of ink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| in the new Sentinel the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| And that's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| We're giving them another quarter page of print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| Well, maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| But that's what we did the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| The article the next day was front page and inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| We've got a substitute motion on the floor just to withdraw it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5241)|

| 1:30:43| We had 15 yes and four no, so motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Well, I just, it's too late now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| I was going to ask folks to change their votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| I'm telling you, I've been, I have been monitoring their communications on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| If they get any more votes in their favor than they got in committee, they're going to view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| that as a victory, and they're going to view that that these e-mails and hateful phone calls got their attention, so I was really hoping for a unanimous vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:07| I just put them in the appropriate file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| We're on 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5472)|

| 1:32:08| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Okay, I think we're on this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| This is regarding Christian Newsom Rapid Response Reward Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| Move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| I wish to propose an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| Replacing the last paragraph with, we request the fund start with $20,000, enough for four $5,000 rewards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5559)|
| 1:32:49| and request that some be donated from the Sheriff's Drug Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| We encourage our friends in the private sector to contribute as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| I make that suggestion so this is no longer an unfunded mandate, and we know where it's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| So I hope that will be taken in that spirit, and I hope it will be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Okay, does the maker of the motion accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I don't know if the Sheriff can take it from his drug fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| I wouldn't feel comfortable accepting that without the Sheriff being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| Commissioner Lambert, could you move this until next month so that we have time to try to work out some of these details?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| I think we can probably do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Hopefully we won't have a need for this until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I'm not sure, Commissioner Harmon, if that money can be used for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| I think there are certain criteria that it has to be used for, drug education or eradication or training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| But I'll talk to the Sheriff and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| My original idea was that this just come out of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| It's not a significant amount of money based on Knox County's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| And I would think that we could go ahead and pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| And then if the Sheriff had some drug money he wanted to contribute to this, that we could take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Yeah, we could take it from one of those auto allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| One of them would cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| But I'll make a motion that we send this, defer it until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| All right, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| I would suggest we go ahead and pass it and let Commissioner Trammell check on the status of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| And then Commissioner Harmon, if that's what we want to do next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| would put it in place on the off chance that we might need it this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| I really would like for this to pass this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| I think that around this horrible case we have had a, you know, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| the talk about this horrible crime has been hijacked by some of these various groups with their own interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:48| And I would like to get the emphasis back on the victims and on future victims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Yeah, I've got a motion that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| And I've rejected the friendly amendment in favor of making that a request rather than a demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| Is that okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Is this reward based on them being found alive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Well, it would be alive before we pay it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| It would be based on whenever it would be a short-term reward that could be used in a variety of different circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| at the discretion of our sheriff and at the discretion of our chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| And it would be something that, you know, wouldn't necessarily have to be a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| It could be some other sort of kidnapping where there is a need to get reward money out on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| but there's no time to raise traditional reward money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| So, I mean, this would be really at the discretion of the chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| and the sheriff as to other applications that it could be used in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| Well, I believe you've got it in here to try to get the people back alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Back alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| That was, well, I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| What is the time limit going to be on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| I felt like probably seven days, 15 days, just to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| We pay that and you pay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| To build, you know, to build regular donated reward funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| This is just a clarification, Commissioner Lambert, that this would come out of fund balance now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| but I take it that this is an account that would carry over and would be replenished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| so there would have that be in it or is it just a one-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| Well, the hope would be is that this would be a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| It wouldn't come back in the budget every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Requests could be made to put more money in this account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| but the idea is that this would be the seed money to start this fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| and that hopefully our friends with the chamber would put money in it from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| So I'm guessing that the police chief and the sheriff would have to really communicate on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| because if one is drawing down X number of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| then the police chief would need to know that there's only so much money left in the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| And they would have the opportunity not to use, say, four or $5,000 rewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| Let's say someone wanted to do $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| They would have that option to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| They would have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| So whatever the amount is, they would be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| And it would really be at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| They would just be making a pool of money available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| If, you know, if the chief of police said, we've got this crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| if we could offer a reward and get some officers on the street offering a reward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| it may help get, you know, get a positive lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| Commissioner Trammell, I was just chatting about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| You're saying immediately after a crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| Again, we're leaving this up to the sheriff and the police chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| and I'm sure they're going to use their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| But do we want to say violent crime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Do we want to specify the crime or just leave it up to their discretion as to when they would use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| Yeah, I really think leave it at the, I mean, I trust our sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5872)|
| 1:38:00| I trust our chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| And I would trust them to know when this was appropriate to use and when it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| I mean, this certainly wouldn't be money to be used to catch somebody for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| selling dope on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| But, you know, I would leave it up to their discretion because I trust the judgment of both of those fine men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| It goes to the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Commissioner Harmon had a good thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| Let's ask our friends on city council to ante up some, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| And, you know, looking at this, if you look at the crime that happens, many times a city has shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| and they can't get witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| They'll have 20 or 30 people standing around watching the shooting, but nobody wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| So to solve some of these in the first 48 hours in a homicide is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| And I'd like to change it from just kidnapping to maybe, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Oh, yeah, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| I'm really, I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| And, again, this is the first one of these things I've typed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| and I'm sure that our law director would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| And we need to let the law director do some checking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| He doesn't know if we're able to do this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| Most of the times these rewards come from the state, through the attorney general's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and from the governor back, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| I thought we had chartered for Montgomery and we could do whatever we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| That's what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| You said we didn't have a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| They said I didn't know if we had a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| We've got a good one, I'll tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Can I speak to this for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| We did some research on this issue a year or so ago and could not find authority in Tennessee law for Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:42| to offer a reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| There needs to be some grant of authority from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| The only authority that we have found in state law is for the governor to offer a reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5988)|
| 1:39:59| And it looks like the governor is the sole person who's vested with that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| And that state law says, and I'll quote it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| the governor is authorized to offer a reward for information leading to the apprehension, arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| and conviction of a suspected criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| So the statute is conjunctive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| You've got to have all of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| So to only offer it piecemeal, I mean, even the governor wouldn't be authorized to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:30| Could a private organization do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Could the chamber of partnership do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| There has to be some public purpose in order for us to utilize these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| And there must be some authority for it somewhere in state law or in the Knox County charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:49| And it is silent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| What about a non-profit group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Catch a criminal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| You could, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| I'll have one started tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| Maybe the city, because they're a municipality, could do such a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| And they could create the fund and we could, the sheriff and the police chief, could work it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| I didn't find, you know, any authority for the city to do it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| Now, it may be there, and I just haven't come upon it yet, but I didn't find the authority for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| I talked to Mr. Edwards from the chamber last week, and I showed this to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| And I said, if it's not legal for Knox County to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| is this something the chamber would be willing to take on and run it through you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| And he seemed open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| He's no longer here, so I would hate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| I mean, it's a very noble idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| It's just one that I don't know that we can expend public funds for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| I don't find the authority for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| You want to maybe roll it until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| I'll roll it until next month and we'll have these questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| By chance, is public forum open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| The guy in the yellow shirt wanted to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| Well, we haven't got there just quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| We've got just a couple more things and then we'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| I guess, do we need a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| I withdrew my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Put it on next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Clerk, I believe we're on the one dealing with the elected officials going to the state meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:24| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| $310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| $310.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Actuary study from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| I'll move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:34| Lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| Lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| No other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| I think we're on ordinances on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:51| We had another one, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Did we add Commissioner Pinkston about the making the --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| No, it's just supposed to be on there, Jody said, in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| I didn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| No, not that one, the one dealing with the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| Oh, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| The legislature, you want them to see if they could grant authority to work all inmates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| All inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Paul, this is a resolution asking them to give us the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| Put Mr. Harmon in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| No, we had a little jokester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Commissioner Pinkston, did you see the one on there dealing with the South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Oh, sure, I sure did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| But I thought Jody said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| It might have been on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Jody, can you see if that one dealing with the South Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| Is that a resolution or an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| Jody, are you looking for that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| Yeah, where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| It's in your book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| No, no, this is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:29| We had a 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6269)|
| 1:44:30| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| We had a different 905 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| We'll go to 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| It's under my 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| It's in your 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| Did it get approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| We voted a 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| It's in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| Hammond's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| What it is, it's requesting that the legislature rename the South Knoxville bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Is that right, Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| You're sending it to the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| What it is, James C. Ford, he was a teacher in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| He was born March 11, 1958.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| He was a school teacher, later become superintendent of Knox County Schools from 1889 to 1897.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:16| He was admitted to the bar in 1885, elected county attorney in 1886 and held that office for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| He was a clerk and master of chancery court for 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| He was commissioner of elections in Knox County in 1907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| And this bridge took his property where his home place is and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| And I'd like to we're just asking the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Commissioner Pinkston, I don't know if we added this or not, but if we did, let's add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| I don't think we added it, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| You need two-thirds to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| Well, if we can do it without objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| If there's no objections, we'll add it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| You want to make a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| I can make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Second by Commissioner Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| We're on ordinances on first reading 101 on page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| 101 and 102 were deferred to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| I'll make a motion to defer both of those to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| They've already been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| So we're on 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| This is an ordinance to adopt the Knox County Interactive Water Amusements Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6379)|
| 1:46:25| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Intergovernmental voted 9-0 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Finance Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| Finance Committee voted 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Seconded by Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| I think we're on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| He's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| Angie Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| Get him down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| If you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| You all can pass it amongst yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Just start at one end if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:11| My name is Angie Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| I live at 8029 Hill Road in Hollis, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| A lot of you already know me from coming to the other meetings and complaining about being flooded from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| And, yes, the problem's been taken care of at taxpayers' expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| About $15,000 worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| And I don't think it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| For nine months we've complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| Mr. Smith has been at my house several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Mr. Moore has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Mr. Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| And nine months of asking somebody what the county is going to do with water, a little ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:53| And this new ordinance, the storm water ordinance and everything, something needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6473)|
| 1:48:01| If they're not going to enforce the one they got now, how are they going to enforce a stricter one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| Like I've told them, I've talked to Chris Grangeau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| I've talked to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| Knox County did not go up to the gentleman and say, build a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| He went to Knox County and wanted to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| So why did the taxpayers have to pay to pipe water 600 feet when it's going to benefit nobody but his subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:34| I really don't know what else to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Except, I mean, the book plainly shows violation after violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:41| They can do about it now because the subdivision is about done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| But it's going on in several other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| And one that I won't bring up right now, but my mother and mother-in-law and grandmother live in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| And, I mean, when I now finally start to understand that if a retention pond busts, it's going to be up to them to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6533)|
| 1:49:03| But if Knox County is not building it right to start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| then why should my mother and my mother-in-law and my grandmother on fixed income have to pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| So, I mean, I sit here and I listen about the budget today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| And I'm sitting here thinking, well, all this money that everybody is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| but yet they just worked out $15,000 because the excuse was because we approved the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6560)|
| 1:49:31| We approved them because they told me they never come out and looked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:35| Well, if they keep approving plans like this and nobody is going to pay attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| how many more thousands of dollars are we going to have to spend to keep from it not being done right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| I mean, is there not something we can do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6586)|
| 1:49:49| I mean, does it make any sense to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| I think we're addressing some of those concerns in this stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| You know, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| We had to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| But I am glad you got your problem fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| And somebody said, well, why are you still complaining if your problem is fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| And I'm like, because I just paid literally $15,000 out of taxpayers' money to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:15| when it shouldn't have been Knox County having to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| I mean, I don't know exactly how to ask it or how it's supposed to be said and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| I mean, I know you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Mr. Smith knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| I mean, he's been at my house a dozen times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| And, I mean, it's just getting ridiculous that they're, in layman's terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:38| rubber stamping the plans and nobody is going out there to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| I mean, can't they do something about that with the new ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| Maybe that might help keep from having a lot of money spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| That's something we've got to continue to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| And I know I think everybody here is concerned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| And I just wanted to voice my opinion on it, that it was just, to me, it was ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| And I still, and like I told Chris Grange, Grant Rosenberg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| I still think the developer should have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| If there's a problem with the subdivision, then he needs to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| But if Knox County engineers are rubber stamping the plans and they're costing Knox County money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| then maybe something needs to be looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| I think you wrote a nice letter about the employees that went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| And if I had dealt with them back in August of last year, I probably wouldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:31| So, I mean, they were a great bunch of guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| I just wish I had dealt with them instead of up the line a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Do you know if they put in concrete or galvanized pipe in that 600 foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:42| Galvanized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| It was about 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| Well, it didn't go in my property either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| And I know I've heard the issues over the pipe and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| I don't know a lot of the difference between those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| But my thing is the fact that I don't think that we should have had to pay for it to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| That's not a free-flowing stream, is it, Angie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| It's an unnamed contributary to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| Yes, they're dumping it straight into there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Water runs through it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Mr. Chairman, I'm disappointed that staff is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| I mean, Bruce and some of his people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| we have public forums and stuff like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Maybe if we can find out what the people want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| But there's nobody from administration here that hears some of these concerns that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| there's some other things that we've been talking about and this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6750)|
| 1:52:34| I think staff needs to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| I don't know what power we have to get the administration to have some people down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| But, you know, they need to hear what she's got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| And she's got some praises for them and she's got some things not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| But I think it looks bad when staff leaves us when we're still carrying on business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| And I understand it during our zoning issues and NPC merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| But when our constituents come up to us and have issues, we, you know, we're here to serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| I apologize for nobody being here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| I mean, I've talked to Mr. Weitrick on the telephone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| He told me I should go talk to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| I didn't know it was my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| So, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| I just wanted to voice my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:17| Thank you, Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6799)|
| 1:53:20| Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you, too, Ms. Fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| And you're speaking to a body that may be more important than the engineering department in this coming ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| And every time some individual comes up and speaks like you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| they reemphasize the need for us to pay attention to inspection, detection, violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6816)|
| 1:53:44| And these kinds of things are what is going to make the difference in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| And certainly people like you make a difference in how we perceive what we're to do in the writing of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Well, I just wanted to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| In the book that's passing around, there is the subdivision checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| And the subdivision inspector visited the site 42 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| And the pictures plainly show that even Paul Sloan himself said it's obvious violations from the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| There's not one notice of violation written on the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| But, like I said, it's kind of late now, I think, from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Len Mays, you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6867)|
| 1:54:35| My name is Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| I reside at 10,700 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| I'd like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| I know my name is not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| This is the second time I've called in to be here to talk to you about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| On both occasions, my name was deleted from the agenda for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| Anyway, I'm here about enforcing air quality regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| specifically coming from Natural Resources Recovery or North County Green Waste Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6896)|
| 1:55:04| This facility was given a permit in 2003, CMP47-0001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:14| I've got two different petitions here, if you guys are interested in seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| The last time I came before you, I think it was in October or November of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| Nobody's interested in seeing these, but I've got two different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| One for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| Just start right there on that end and they'll pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:36| Two different petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| As I say, one back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| I think it was 32 signatures, counting husband and wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| It was told about 36 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| On the latest one, it was 38 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| Last time I came before you people, you told me I need to talk to Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| I tried to contact him the whole week, following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| Finally, on Friday, his receptionist, the secretary, called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| I didn't know what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| I informed her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| She said she would relay the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| Mr. Arms never returned a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| During this process, since this thing has been in service, we've had nothing but complaints about this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6966)|
| 1:56:15| I just want to read here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:16| This registration authorizes solid waste from CMP 47001, effective permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:26| The assurance of this permit does not authorize the permitting or injuring persons or property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| or permit to injury persons or property or to invade other private rights or to violate any local law or regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:41| That top piece of paper I sent around, the latest survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| We've got violations of regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| There's six regulations that they're not enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| I've talked first of all when this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| It was a solid waste issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| We go to Solid Waste Department, John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| The problem does not exist, according to John Evans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| Then we go to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| He had a neighborhood meeting in March of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| At that time, this problem will not go past March, December of 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| That's what he stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| In November of 2005, we had a meeting again with the mayor's office personnel, the managers of that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| and the neighborhood people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| They said they could clear it up in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| Well, we said, if you can clear it up in two months, this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| We'll give you three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| February, another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| I had surgery on my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| But as to this date, we still don't have the problem to clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| I'll come before this commission last time, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Send me Mr. Harms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:38| Then I'll find out about our quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| Maybe our quality regulates this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| So I send him a copy of this petition for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| They seem interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7067)|
| 1:57:48| I thought they were going to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| And the director, Ms. Littleton, sends me a letter out and says there's been no violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| But yet, I go up to her office and I check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| She sent 16 people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| Out of the 16, one detected a slight odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| One's a moderate odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| One's a very strong sewer odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| So it's three out of 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Three out of 16, they still have an odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| And she says, well, I'll go out and take your sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| So she sends somebody out to take a sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7094)|
| 1:58:16| You're taking a two-minute sample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Then they go and stick six more hours, the same quantity of hours, into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| Then they have somebody to smell it and see if there's an odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| You got one sample over this time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| Anybody with a math background knows that sample is completely unreliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:33| The percent of confidence in that sample is essentially zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| But then she sends me a letter saying we don't have any odor violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| So then I go down to the Tennessee Department of Environmental and Conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| and start looking through their records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| And I made three different copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| I got four copies here of their violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| I just took four of them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| Complaints of odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7138)|
| 1:58:59| Compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Finished on the first stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Due to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Must be stored on panel surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Not stored on panel surfaces, paved surfaces, as they're supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| They're just dumping it out on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| That was in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| And then here's in March 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Nuisance odors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| Could smell at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| Waste processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Curing not conducted on paved surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| This is March 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| This is March 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| Still got the same problem a year later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| All this stuff I've got here, you can go through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| The director of solid wastes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Well, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| John Evans called last week to relate odor problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| This is dated March 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Now, John Evans never admitted to me there was an odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| But John Evans called LFC last week to relate odor issues with a facility related by neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| and facilities contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| They're an airway of slightly different waste treatment plants for the Russians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| They are permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| They are permitted to be related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| They are actively researching methods to conduct, combat the odor, and discuss the incorporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| of pallet ashes from the Malabdin facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| It was related that no more marble biosolids were received until the technique compost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| issues resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| They asked to run experiments in our backyard to find out how to fix the problem they created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| I don't know who's responsible for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| I don't know who's responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I go to air quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| She said, no, we don't have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Then I find out there's an air quality board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| I went to them last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| I presented my effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| They seem like they're receptive for this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| But I thought the mayor was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| But nothing's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:47| Your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| But we've got Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7248)|
| 2:00:49| He's got his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| What the gentleman's saying is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7252)|
| 2:00:53| My son, daughter-in-law, and my little grandbaby live on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7253)|
| 2:00:58| And I have been out there when the odor has been so strong, you cannot sit outside on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| your back porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| And if you're trying to grill a hamburger or something, you're sitting there and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| trying to smell that smell, you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| Now, he's saying exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Now, when I started checking into what the smell was, because I certainly didn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| my granddaughter smelling that smell or myself or anybody out there, I was told that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| were bringing material from the zoo out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| I was also told that there was sludge being brought in from the utility districts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| that they were bringing it in at night and that they were doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| And as a result, you know, you would get this odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| And it's not every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| But, boy, when it is out there, you can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| And I would ask anybody to go out when this is going on and you'll know exactly what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:41| Now, my son and daughter-in-law have moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| And one of the reasons they moved was because of that odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| So I know he's talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| What he's telling us is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| I've been there and I have smelled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| No citizen in Knox County should have to endure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| And so I'm going to ask that next month this be put on the agenda and that people be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| in here and let's ask questions as to why this is not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7320)|
| 2:02:04| And if it is being addressed, then let's find out what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| But let's get this gentleman some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| This is the second time he's been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| And I've talked to the neighbors of my son out there who tell me it's still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| And so, anyway, I'd like, Mr. Chairman, a formal request to have this put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| Let's put on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| I believe the city had one years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| And didn't they get rid of theirs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| I mean, because I think it had the same problems as we're having now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| And I think we heard just a couple months ago they were bringing stuff in from outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| the county to that facility, too, to grind up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| I've got a letter here from Mr. Pops dated March 10, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| He owns 70 acres up behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| And he had people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| They were going to develop this area for first-class homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| And then when this happened, it's in the record of TDEC, Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7372)|
| 2:03:01| The contractor withdrew out and said, hey, I can't build anything in an older like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| We apologize for everybody out there having to smell that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| But can we keep that for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| Yes, you're welcome to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:14| I've got more copies of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| We've got a couple of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7396)|
| 2:03:17| Commissioner Catewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| Do you want to keep this letter of his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| If you've got anything you want us to keep, we'd like to keep it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| Make it part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| I would like to have a copy of the signatures that are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:31| I know all of those are my constituents, and I'd like to contact them personally about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7411)|
| 2:03:37| Also, I would like to ask Commissioner Hammond, how long has it been since your son has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:44| out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| Oh, he's lived on West Emory Road for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| Now, they've since moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| But when this problem started coming up, he called me, and I went out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:51| Well, he called me and said, you need to come out here now and smell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| Well, we drove out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| I mean, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| It was difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| When I started checking into the problem, that's what I was told, is that they're bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| in stuff from the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| They may have stopped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| They were also bringing in sludge from First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| They were bringing it in at night, and they were trying to do it at night and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| cover it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| That's what I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| I was told that the problem was being like you, that it's being addressed, and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Now, my son has since moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| But if the problem's still going on, I know how strong that odor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| You cannot sit outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| And so next month, let's get it on the agenda, and let's find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| My understanding is that it has cleared up quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7464)|
| 2:04:28| It's not 100% cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| And this is a regional facility, so there is things coming in from Anderson County that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:38| are supposed to be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| And I believe the sludge, they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7480)|
| 2:04:44| They identified where that was coming from, and it was not supposed to be coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| They have stopped bringing that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| They no longer have a contract for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| The zoo materials may not be affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| When you say they stopped contracting and bringing sludge in, you mean from one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| They're still bringing sludge in from many facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:04| The one that was the biggest odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| I mean, the odor has decreased, but it's still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| You go out in your backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:12| The problem has decreased, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| I talked to the solid waste director last week, and he told me that the odor has decreased dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:22| There may be one day a month that the odor is present now, is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| I've had it occur the last four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| In a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| This is why it will be good to have some kind of meeting next month and have it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| Let's find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| I think that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| Maybe if they can't get it fixed, maybe they just need to quit composting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| I don't know if it's the composting or the sludge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| Right now, I'm just asking the air quality board is supposed to find some kind of report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| and get back to me within 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:53| I just ask them to deny bringing that sludge in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| And if that's not the problem, then go to the composting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| In the other area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| I just wanted to say, I'm glad you put this on the agenda, because that was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| I was going to request if you hadn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| But, I mean, I noticed it when I was out in that area campaigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| In fact, the kids that campaigned with me joked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| And I just called a friend of mine that lives in the area, Mr. E.O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| Ellison, and I said, go outside and tell me if you can smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| He knew exactly what I wanted to know, and you can smell it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| He said it's not the worst it's been, but that he can tell it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| And, I mean, we have got to get something done about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| This is one of the most beautiful areas of our county, and plagued with that horrible odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| Sir, I just want to apologize to you that nobody's here to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:50| We need some administration people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| We wouldn't have to put this off until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| We could have handled it here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Joe Lee, I don't know if they called in the office and they asked to be put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| if you can maybe ask people what they want to talk about so we can have the appropriate people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| But his time is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7624)|
| 2:07:05| Our time is valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:06| And, Mr. Chairman, if we can have some administration here to answer some of these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:11| we need to serve these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike, and I can explain where your staff is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| They're at the stormwater meeting, and I hope I make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| I did want to address a few things about that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| First of all, I'd like to thank the commission for your part in asking that public meetings be held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| about the stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| I think they've been very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| This is the third one, actually, out of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| One was held here in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7663)|
| 2:07:47| Five, one was held here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| As you know, there are two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| They're both this week, tonight and Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| There have been many issues mentioned at the first meetings by the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| I'm sure there will be many other mentioned in the other two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| The engineering department was so gracious to meet with us after hearing our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| regarding the flood damage prevention ordinance and making changes that we brought to their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| We're asking, in the same spirit of cooperation, the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| to meet with us within a week of the last public presentation or meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| to look at the issues that the public has brought to their attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| and that we can evaluate at that time changes to the new stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| One thing I'd like to address, since Ms. Fields spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| one of the recommendations by Arcadis Tetra Tech covers the very thing she was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7720)|
| 2:08:47| It is not in the ordinance, and I don't see any move to make it a part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| It said to require stormwater management to be addressed more fully in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7733)|
| 2:08:59| The rest of what I'm going to read is direct quotes from the Tetra Tech Arcadis comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:06| that they made of the city county ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Now only the general location of stormwater best management practices is identified at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7748)|
| 2:09:17| The county's required grading plan and permit are approved before the design plan is submitted for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7757)|
| 2:09:26| In grading a site, a developer can destroy many good opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| for better site design stormwater management and location for BMPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| It's important to determine the surface area needed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| and the location of stormwater controls in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7780)|
| 2:09:47| Note that the city concept plan requires 20 to 30 percent drawing for stormwater management controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| and a more detailed analysis is required in the next phase of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| This is also a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| Require applicants to attend a pre-design conference before the concept plan is submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7802)|
| 2:10:09| to review better site design opportunities and to make clear that stormwater management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| must be incorporated throughout all phases of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| as well as to answer questions up front about erosion prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| sediment control and stormwater management requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| I implore you to at least, if you don't do anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| do at least the two requirements that Tetra Tech Arcadis did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:39| and the 15 recommendations that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7839)|
| 2:10:42| or was $400,000 of the taxpayer money spent for nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7842)|
| 2:10:48| because that's what this body and city council paid for the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| And to absolutely ignore their suggestions and recommendations to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| seems ludicrous after spending almost half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7863)|
| 2:11:04| Thank you, Ms. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| If we don't have an objection from this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| if we could go back, if it's possible to go back to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| Victor Jernigan, you're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| Do you want to see if we can take up your zoning issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| Oh, you had someone here, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7880)|
| 2:11:21| Okay, the last thing then, we talked about having a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| Oh, I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| I'm not on the agenda, but I didn't know if I could speak at the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| My name is Jeff Pifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| I live at 1705 Gray Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| And I'm aware that MPC has sent an invitation to a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| for the Knoxville-Knox County Tree Conservation and Planting Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7904)|
| 2:11:49| that MPC has adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| And I think there's a joint workshop scheduled for maybe this Thursday at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| I guess I'm here just to encourage you to attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| and hopefully gain your support for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| I am a landscape architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| I've lived in the county for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| And trees don't seem to be on the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7925)|
| 2:12:08| They're here naturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| It's a beautiful asset of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| But, you know, I hope that we can begin to preserve some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7931)|
| 2:12:19| and plant some when we do development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7939)|
| 2:12:24| So I hope to see you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7946)|
| 2:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| I was just going to say I plan to attend that and look forward to being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| And I just wanted to let you know, in this session today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| we voted to require that a landowner, as a consequence of rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:42| plant 20 percent of his property in trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7962)|
| 2:12:45| I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7965)|
| 2:12:46| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:48| I have been involved in meetings with community groups, neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| and the citizens are ready for the support of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| I think they're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| And I hope that you'll do your part to help as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7978)|
| 2:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7983)|
| 2:13:04| Mr. Piper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Mr. Piper, thank you again for coming and bringing this up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| It's one of those issues that is probably critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| and not as well understood by most of us that it functions as a piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=7996)|
| 2:13:23| that's very important and has to do with stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| it has to do with land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| it has to do with the aesthetic values of various things that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| as Knoxvillians and East Tennesseans, value very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8012)|
| 2:13:36| And so we appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Commissioner Hammond, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Commissioner Cate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| Just a thanks for reminding us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| That is the same night as the stormwater public meeting in the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| and southwest end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| And I expect that several of us will be at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8035)|
| 2:13:59| so we may not be able to make the tree ordinance or the tree plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| Mr. Bolus, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8048)|
| 2:14:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| It's been a long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8052)|
| 2:14:13| I've got the, if we know when we would like to have a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8053)|
| 2:14:19| as Mr. Cate said, he wanted to have it after hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| we can either have it from, like, the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| But some of you all said you'd be gone that week, a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8070)|
| 2:14:33| I'm gone all week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| What about the 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| That's on Tuesday the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| You've got a commissioner's night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| I'm gone 11th, 12th, and 13th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8083)|
| 2:14:46| About the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| 14th, I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| Is that a Thursday, Mr. Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| That's a Thursday on the 14th is Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| Does that work for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| It's better for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Commissioner Moore, didn't he say he had to have that in by the 15th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8097)|
| 2:15:01| He wanted it approved by the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| That's cutting it too close, the 14th there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| Their meeting's not until the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| They have to have 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| But I believe he said he had to have it in by the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| He said he could make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8112)|
| 2:15:13| Plenty of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| He can make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| He can make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| We need about a 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8118)|
| 2:15:20| 14th is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8120)|
| 2:15:26| Well, you can't go into the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:28| We need to back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8128)|
| 2:15:29| We've got some people out of town the whole week of the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8129)|
| 2:15:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| Commissioner's conference fits in 6th and then people are out of town on the 8th and 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8138)|
| 2:15:43| 14th is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| Well, why don't we just say the 14th at 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| Is this for the public hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| This is for the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| What about something with the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| Well, Roy said he was satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| Well, yeah, but Superintendent Mullins doesn't have a vote when it comes down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8162)|
| 2:16:06| It's the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Let's do them at 4 o'clock then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| Go forward and public meeting at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Why don't you do them at 4 and then at 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| They spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| And school at 4 and then the public meeting at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| Does that work for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:18| And we just eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| We eat at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| 4 and 6 on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Well, why don't we say 5 o'clock on the 14th for the school board if we can get them, if they've got, if they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| Can they take us to dinner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| And then at 6 o'clock we'll have a public hearing for the citizens that want to talk about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| Do you think they need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| No, we said 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| For the school board, 6 o'clock for the public workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| And it'll be in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:51| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| We're going to have to vote on that then, the 14th too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| We've got to get it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I think we're cutting this a little thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Well, I do too, but at the end of the day, if we can't get to it, maybe we can get some of the answers between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8221)|
| 2:17:09| But, you know, if it goes on and we can't get it done, I mean, they'll just have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8229)|
| 2:17:15| We authorize you to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| We can't wait on that pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| That's been mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| We've got to have that there by July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Yeah, but I think they still might have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| I'm going by Richard Beeler, what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| He said the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| Call for the pension board there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Yeah, I think they said if they had it by the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| And that would be our committee meetings anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| So maybe if we had to, we'd have that a couple of days over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8257)|
| 2:17:42| We'd have a Friday and that weekend and vote on it on Monday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8262)|
| 2:17:49| I want you to take full responsibility if this thing's not met by July the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:55| Don't put it on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Well, I'm putting it on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Well, I mean, we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| I understood the man say he had to have it by the 15th because they met down there the 25th, their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8278)|
| 2:18:04| Well, do we want to have something while some of the people are out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8284)|
| 2:18:08| Well, all I'm saying is we're going to have it the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8288)|
| 2:18:10| I want everybody to be prepared to stay here and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:21| If we have it the 14th and go into another session on the 15th to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8301)|
| 2:18:26| have public hearings the 14th and set the 15th to vote, that would still give him ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| That's what he needed, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8310)|
| 2:18:32| He needed ten days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8312)|
| 2:18:35| What he has to do is he has to draft a bond resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| What's going to be wrong with it is we're having these meetings just voting on it the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8318)|
| 2:18:45| I think because if we can't get it done on the 14th, then we're going to have to do another public notice five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:53| Then we'll already have something set for the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| Then we're going to the 20th then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| So you'll vote on the 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| Yeah, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| If you need to add something while I'm out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| That's what I'm saying, Mr. Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Okay, hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| We're getting Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| I mean, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8350)|
| 2:19:11| If we've got to give another five-day notice, we're talking about meeting the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| And he's told us he needed this for the 15th to get it in down there for the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| If we do the 14th public hearings in the school board and then we set another meeting for the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8360)|
| 2:19:25| that's two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| If we can't get it ironed out by the 14th and we go back in session on the 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| and hammer it out and maybe we can get it done then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| and then we can send it to him and he's got ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| If not, if we don't get it done by the 15th, then we'll have to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| We've got a state of mass confusion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| Commissioner Moore, I would suggest that you get with Richard Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| and see if that's satisfactory to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| And if it is, then you just send us all a notice that it's satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8391)|
| 2:19:56| And if it's not with him, I mean, we could probably have something the week of the 4th through the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8396)|
| 2:20:01| and some people ain't going to be here, but maybe if there's some questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| then we could have something on the 14th as well and maybe have two hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| If we need to cover something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| But you're looking at having a meeting the 14th or the 15th to vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8410)|
| 2:20:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| And we'll get something out to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| If you have something the 4th through the 8th, you don't have to have it after hours either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| And we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070529part2?start=8423)|
