| 0:01:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| I'll now turn the meeting over to Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| for our devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| It gives me great honor to have our Chief of Corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=113)|
| 0:01:58| for the Knox County Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| William Purvis, to do our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| When he's not working 65-plus hours at the corrections facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| he does also have another job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| He's the pastor of the North Acres Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| So please give Mr. Purvis a warm welcome, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Thank you all for the opportunity to do this devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| My devotion today is going to be from the Gospel of John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| in the third chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| This scripture, as we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| it speaks to an area of our life that many of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| we have this desire to have more of an impact, more influence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| more significance in our life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| to be able to provide more service to the world that we live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| And often we think that that pathway to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| is through addition to things in our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Sometimes we think that adding another, reading another book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| going to another conference, having another seminar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| is going to enrich our lives and help it to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| that we might be able to create more influence in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| But in that gospel, there is a time period where John the Baptist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| he has his disciples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| they are baptizing in the same area that Jesus' disciples are baptizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| And as John the Baptist, his disciples are looking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| and they see more and more people coming to be baptized by Jesus' disciples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| they begin to become a little jealous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| And they run and they go to John the Baptist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| and they said, Rabbi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| this one that you bore witness to on the other side of Jordan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| he's baptizing more people than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| All men are being drawn to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| And John the Baptist's disciples were expecting them to commiserate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=232)|
| 0:04:00| or John to commiserate with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| and maybe even go speak to Jesus about all these numbers that are coming to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| and the dwindling numbers that are coming to John the Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| But John the Baptist didn't respond that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| In fact, he started pointing them towards Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| and he said to his disciples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=260)|
| 0:04:23| he said, he must increase and I must decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| And he was pointing out again, and that was in John chapter 3, verse number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| And to remember the words of our Lord in Matthew 11 and 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| he spoke about John the Baptist, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| amongst those that are born of women, there was not a greater than John the Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| And for him to emphasize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| that he had to decrease and that Jesus must increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| is a reminder to each one of us that when we desire to have this significance or impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| we want to do more in this world to show the love of our Lord and to serve more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=297)|
| 0:05:04| that pathway isn't through the addition of many other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| but it's by us decreasing and losing that desire to bring the spotlight upon ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| and shining that spotlight on Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| showing his love to others in the way that we live our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| And if you don't mind, I'd like to pray for all of you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| Heavenly Father, Lord, I thank you so much, Lord, for your son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| We thank you, Lord, for the life that he lived, the life that he gave on the cross of Calvary, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| that we might be able, Lord, to come into your family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| to have life everlasting, Lord, and Heavenly Father, to become new creatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| And Heavenly Father, Lord, I just pray for each and every one of these servants of yours that are here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=341)|
| 0:05:46| Lord, I ask that you would guide and direct in each and every one of their lives, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| We ask that you would give them wisdom from on high, Lord, that they would make decisions, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| that would honor you and, Lord, that would serve your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| Oh, Heavenly Father, Lord, we ask these things today in that most holy of all names, the name of Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| And we'll now stand, please, for the Pledge of Allegiance led by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| I'd like to introduce a veteran and one of our favorites as a law officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=380)|
| 0:06:29| and I want to thank all law officers and all EMTs and all emergency personnel that are out there serving today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=389)|
| 0:06:37| It's a hard job, and we didn't plan it this way, but we asked Sheriff Spangler to do the Pledge of Allegiance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=397)|
| 0:06:44| Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| So face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=417)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| This is the first evening that we are having a meeting with our new microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| I am curious if you all feel like there's feedback up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| Are you hearing us clearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Is it all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Commissioners, did you notice any feedback from the public podium when the speaker was speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| I don't know, Hex, if it was too loud,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| but there was a lot of feedback that was not allowing us to be able to hear clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| So we will get this figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| We appreciate very much your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=483)|
| 0:08:14| We are now going to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| If everyone will please take these additions and notes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=497)|

| 0:36:31| commissioners. So please don't pass this resolution. It is neither wholesome, nor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| good, nor honorable. It will put a national spotlight on this county, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2196)|

| 0:36:49| that Eric Weider is a parasite and a cancer within that party. I hope that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2209)|

| 0:37:55| statement of principle. I would point out that passing the resolution could still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| present dangers to community organizations and events, ranging from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2279)|

| 0:38:54| that's not what this resolution is about, whatever language it manufactures as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| distraction to its actual intent. It is about advancing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| culture of suspicion and fear against LGBTQ people, their families, and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2344)|
| 0:39:11| communities, and its goal is to erode and harass public institutions that allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| LGBTQ people to have a voice. It was mentioned by the previous speaker that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| local conservative political strategist acknowledged that he adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| language of this resolution from a similar one in Michigan. He sent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| same template to Sumner County and one of the commissioners there who voted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2373)|

| 0:39:54| understand that this resolution now under consideration has been revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| into something with a more symbolic effect, but before you vote, consider what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| it really symbolizes. The last time I attended a county commission meeting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| few months ago, the meeting opened with a devotional in which one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| commissioners expressed real concern about the divisions in our communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| across our whole country, and I can't help but think that in co-sponsoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2419)|
| 0:40:27| this particular resolution or by endorsing it, you're not really helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| to resolve that problem. You're making it worse, so I hope that you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| not endorse the resolution, and I appreciate your attention here this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2437)|

| 0:43:16| removed from this resolution, funding that would prevent public taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| dollars from being used to fund the very events that may harm children. It makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| no sense. How can you say you want to protect children, yet pay for the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2603)|

| 0:43:32| that may harm children. And lastly, I want to remind this Commission that in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2612)|

| 0:43:41| Constitutional County. Commissioners Spiegeler and Daley brought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| resolution and stated at the time, it had no teeth, it was a statement. While I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2624)|
| 0:43:49| understand that some of you were not on Commission at that time, I believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| have a responsibility to our children by showing them and the public at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| that we will do whatever it takes to protect our children. On behalf of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2636)|

| 0:44:22| resident of Knox County, here to support Commissioner Lee's resolution which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| effectively solidifies Knox County's commitment to protect children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| innocence. Such a resolution is sadly necessary because of the steady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| dismantling of children's natural innocence intrinsic to unprecedented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| exposure to sexualized behavior content and gender ideology. In a recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2682)|

| 0:44:56| responsibilities. Whether it's allowing pornographic and gender confusing books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| in our libraries and schools or the appalling phenomenon of drag queen shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| where things too filthy for decent adults to view are done before the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| eyes of children. The question before that county board and every other county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| in America is whether they will allow the normalization of sexual perversion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| to hold sway or will they hold a line and declare, not here, not our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2723)|

| 0:45:35| Tennessee's conservative values. As we said in legislative sessions last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| February, we were incredulous to watch how easily two cutting-edge bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| specifically protecting children passed through the House committee. How vastly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| different from the days of showing up in droves at San Diego's Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| Supervisors where leftist policies won the day every single time. Once a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| thriving state, California is now a house on fire. Its governor is considered the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| leading salesman for U-Haul and what else would one expect when almost weekly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| another egregious law passes, undermining families, pushing gender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2767)|

| 0:46:23| Tennesseans, county by county, do not take a stance now, if we yield to those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| insist on and somehow justify the sexualizing of children, we too will join| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| the ranks of a state rotting from the inside out. Tolerance is not the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| Exposure of the insidious darkness is required. This resolution acknowledges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| the darkness and most importantly commits to having no part of it. On that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| February day at the Capitol, I saw afresh the importance of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| decision-making seats. They carried out the will of the people, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| abundantly clear. Tennessee is a vanguard in our nation, proactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| protecting children as evidenced by laws that prohibit minors from drag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| performances and permanent harm incurred by gender transition procedures. Likewise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| your seat as Knox County Commissioners really matters. Most of the decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| that you make during your tenure will be forgotten, but this resolution, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2844)|
| 0:47:32| resolution has generational implications, for it draws a line in the sand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| declaring we are unswervingly committed to protecting the innocence of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| children and grandchildren. I pray for your discernment and resolve to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| this resolution in its original form for the sake of the children. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| for your attention. Thank you. Following our next speaker is Patty Kim and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2876)|
| 0:48:07| Robert Lee. Sir, if you'd say your name, county of residence, you have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| minutes to speak. Thank you. My name is Dana Hoffseth. I live in Knox County. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| very thankful for the resolution that Commissioner Lee has put forward. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| suspect, and there are others who are standing before you extolling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| virtues of protecting our children and sharing consequences of harm if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| not done. This is a critically important issue and clearly this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| resolution recognizes that. My focus is to strongly encourage the adoption of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| the original version. Those who are opposed will vote against it no matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| how it's put forward or what it includes. Those of you who support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| idea of protecting children from these ideologies that steal the innocence to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| give this resolution real teeth and meaning. What I mean is simply this. I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| say that I support my church or some other charitable organization. I can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| that I've quit smoking or stopped drinking. I can say that I'm a blood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| donor. But in the end, my checkbook tells the story of my giving. In the end, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| breath will speak the truth about my consumption. In the end, my calendar will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| reveal the real me and whether I have actually made those donations to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| blood bank. Likewise, you may say that you intend to protect children, but in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| end, if you are still using staff time and county resources to fund and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| organizations, content, and events that are in all practicality the antithesis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| of protecting children's innocence, your spoken intentions are just words. Words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| without action are merely a facade. Let us not be among those who walk, who talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| a good game, but don't have the fortitude to back it up. Adopt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| original version of this resolution, please, and align county resources with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| the specific words of this positive and helpful resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3010)|

| 0:50:40| doing to kids. Why would we not support a resolution to protect our youngest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| citizens of this county? These shows, we've seen pictures, we've seen videos of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| these shows that these kids are going to, the books that are available in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| library, they're graphic, sometimes scary. We need to protect our children for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3058)|
| 0:51:05| Yes, I believe in parents' rights, okay, but when it comes to something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| this isn't about parents' rights. This is about protecting our young citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Sumner County passed a very strong law, stronger than what we're passing right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3077)|

| 0:51:33| issues that our commissioners are seeing. I'm asking, I'm begging, I'm praying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| you guys will pass this law to, or this resolution, to protect our young kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3099)|

| 0:52:55| God. They are very precious to God. God loves them very much. As adults and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| elected officials, you are held at a higher standard. You people are held at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| higher standard because you're the ones who make the judgment call on the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| that are passed. You will be held to account. We have this privilege and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3196)|
| 0:53:25| responsibility as adults for discernment between unrighteousness and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3205)|

| 0:53:39| deserve protection from the adults and all elected officials. Children around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3219)|

| 0:54:13| before you vote and think about what you're doing to your community. When you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=3253)|

| 1:09:20| to you, some of the background to why this was passed. It was protecting our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| Our culture and community standards are at a crossroads. More and more we are hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| from around the country about graphic and sexually explicit materials that violate state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4174)|
| 1:09:41| laws being available to minors in school libraries. Parents are being reprimanded, called out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4181)|

| 1:09:52| aloud during meetings. These materials are so vile, degenerative, and disgusting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| parents are censored when reading them aloud in the presence of other adults. If this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| the case, why would anyone think that having them in schools for minor age children is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| okay, using taxpayer dollars to subsidize it? In his plea to the school board, Mr. Lacey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| laments that a book called The Bluest Eye plants a seed for 14 to 18-year-olds and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| they can seduce little girls. They can get mints, they can get money and ice cream, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| little girls will allow you to play between their legs. Due to these recent revelations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4230)|

| 1:11:03| the dangers of the exposure and the normalization of sexualized behaviors that would reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| children's inhibitions to protect themselves from the sexual advances of others, such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| the example given by Mr. Lacey. As another school board member recently shared with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4275)|

| 1:11:39| I am asking this commission to adopt the resolution that was passed by Sumner County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4299)|
| 1:11:47| and adding the language to this resolution that, be it further resolved, no county or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4307)|
| 1:12:03| resources shall be allocated to activities, programs, events, content, or institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| which support, normalize, or encourage the sexualization of children and youth, and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| it further resolved that this resolution applies to the extent that it does not conflict with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| Tennessee law. I am asking this commission to approve this resolution. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4340)|
| 1:12:35| Point of clarification, Commissioner Lee. The resolution that is currently on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| is the one that was printed in our agenda. It is. And you are asking to have that added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4362)|
| 1:12:53| to the resolution? Yes. All right. I believe that would require a substitute motion. No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4373)|
| 1:13:02| It's not? Just an amendment. An amendment to your motion, then. All right. Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| to my motion. All right. Thank you. Do we have any other discussion? Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4389)|
| 1:13:26| Just a point of order. Is the second okay with the amendment to the resolution as stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you. Commissioner Daly indicates yes, he is. Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| Thank you, Madam Chair. I hope you will allow me a little latitude here for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| This past week, I feel like my reputation as a Knox County Commissioner was called into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| question by a small group of individuals that actually knew the truth but chose to ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| it. So, just to clarify everything, Commissioner Lee, was I involved with you in writing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| ordinance? No, I have not had any communication with you. Okay. Was I involved with you when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| you made your changes prior to the work session agenda? No, you were not. Okay. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| did I contact you to request changes in this ordinance? You did not. Did I ask you to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| any of the drafting or the revision of the newer ordinance? You did not. Thank you. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I just wanted to clarify that because I have been accused this past week of being the instigator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| of rewriting this resolution when I had absolutely no responsibility or effort in it. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4481)|
| 1:14:51| I just wanted to clear the air. And I am really surprised at certain individuals in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| that would stoop that low to attack me that way. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I regret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4498)|
| 1:15:05| that that has occurred. And then only other one question I have or comment would be, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| if it is good enough for Michigan, then it is good enough for Tennessee and it is good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4513)|
| 1:15:17| enough for Knox County. Is that where we are going with this? Since we did not write this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4517)|
| 1:15:23| resolution, it came from out of state, is my understanding. Is that correct? Yes. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| so an out-of-state resolution is dictating what is going on in Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| Can I address that, Madam Chair? Yes, please do. Well, it is not an out-of-state. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| nothing uncommon for any governmental body to look across the country for new laws and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| new things that are going. So, it is not that it is dictating. I think that it is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| that we adopt it. And we spend millions of dollars as a county to look for resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4552)|
| 1:16:00| on things that we bring before this body all the time. Are you finished? Thank you. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4560)|
| 1:16:13| Durant? Thank you, Madam Chair. I am hesitant to vote against this resolution because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4573)|
| 1:16:22| feel if I vote no, my actions would be spun into something or I feel that me voting no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| would be spun into something making me out to be some kind of monster that is against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| protecting children and their innocence, which cannot be further from the truth. I have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| children and do everything in my power to protect them from things that could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| harm them. But what I consider harmful to my children may not be considered harmful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| to someone else and vice versa. But I cannot vote in support of this resolution for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| reasons. First, this resolution reminds me of what my husband and I call freedom unless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| Freedom unless means we are in support of everyone having their freedoms to live their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| lives however they see fit, unless it goes against a particular belief system. Freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| unless you aren't with us. Freedom unless you like something we don't. Freedom unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| we don't approve. 2020 was a great example of freedom unless. Parents didn't want government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| to make their children wear masks or the Board of Health to tell them where they could or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| could not go. I sat on commission at that time and people were down here telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| that they did not want government overreach. In my opinion, this is exactly a case of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4655)|
| 1:17:43| overreach. If this resolution passes, where does it stop? Do we start making house visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| to 60,000 plus children in our districts to make sure their parents aren't allowing certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| shows, movies, or video games? Do we go after Monday night football because of the unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| skin shown by cheerleaders? Do we not allow children at restaurants where servers wear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| uniforms promoting their body figures? Are these things okay and other things aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| Freedom unless. Secondly, this resolution is incredibly broad. For example, it includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| the word activities but has no clarification of which activities would violate the quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| innocence of children. Since it was likened to Nancy Reagan's war on drugs at our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| session last week, I will liken it to a quote gateway drug. This resolution, if passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| could be used as a gateway to prohibit the freedoms of various groups of people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4718)|
| 1:18:44| different beliefs. I may think something is appropriate while someone else does not. Freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| unless. Third, we should continue to support organizations like the Community Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4730)|
| 1:18:59| Against Human Trafficking, the Helen Ross McNabb Center's Sexual Assault Center, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| Family Justice Center, court-appointed special advocates, Child Help, and countless others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| that are already in the community working to fight the sexualization of children. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| instead, we are here wasting time on a politically charged resolution that targets a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| group of people who may not be viewed in a positive light by others who live their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| differently. Freedom unless. Finally, being a public servant means we act in the public's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4767)|
| 1:19:35| interest, not our own. We are elected to our seats to represent all residents of our districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4775)|
| 1:19:44| not just the ones who agree with our personal beliefs. It should not be freedom unless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4784)|
| 1:19:50| It should simply be freedom. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4790)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you. I apologize. I don't know if Commissioner Frazier, all right. Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4801)|

| 1:20:16| Thank you, Madam Chair. I asked the resolution sponsor last week what specific problem occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4816)|
| 1:20:24| in Knox County is this resolution solving for the people of Knox County, and an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4824)|
| 1:20:29| could not be given to us. If we could legislate all the evil out of the world, we would already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4829)|
| 1:20:35| have done it. Yet murder, rape, child abuse, and all the ills of our community would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| simply go away, but we know that legislating crime away is absolutely not possible. After| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| reading and researching this resolution in detail, I'll say again, I believe it is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| vague and it will enable broad interpretation and potential manipulation. I pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| last week where the resolution came from and what was its origin, and since that time there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| been further research and validated by members of our media community. In just a few other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| counties a resolution almost exactly like this is being used as a first step to ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| reading materials, defund libraries, pull funding from community institutions, and restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| health departments for providing potentially life-saving information to its citizens. At| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| the very least, this resolution aims to further divide this commission and produce disingenuous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| political ammunition for future campaigns, and I think that is a dangerous and quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| frankly a terrible use of our time and our efforts. Please, to my colleagues, do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| be scared into supporting something like this and supporting this resolution just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| because you're worried about how someone might use it against you at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| I am confident that there isn't anyone on this stage that wouldn't do all they can to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| help protect a child, and I know this. There would not be a single commissioner here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| would not do absolutely anything they could to protect children, but this resolution does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| not do anything. I believe that we should be a legislative body that works hard to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| meaningful results for our constituents. As such, I took a minute to reach out to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| people who are experts in how to protect children in our community, and I asked them how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| could help as the commission. I asked them what specific initiatives the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4934)|

| 1:23:11| offenders themselves, so if we want to help break the cycle of abuse and protect children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| of the future, then we could continue the now-temporary funding that has allowed him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| to hire more counselors focusing on long-term managed counseling and care. Mr. Smith told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5000)|

| 1:23:37| community. And then finally, last night I met with Commissioner Margie Quinn, who leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| the Tennessee Department of Children's Services, and we had an in-depth conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| protecting children, and she said one of the most important organizations combating child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5025)|

| 1:24:08| We have so many more organizations, and it is simply meant to illustrate that if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| commission wants to help protect the innocence of children, then we have real, tangible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and practical options to choose from, and we can take real action to make this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| a better and safe place for all children. Those are things that I'm going to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| and those are the things that I'm going to bring to this commission. But with that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| encourage my fellow commissioners to join me in those efforts and not give any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| consideration to this resolution, which could have far-reaching and possibly damaging future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| implications. Madam Chair, with that, I wish to make a substitute motion to table this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| resolution to a time indefinite. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5081)|
| 1:24:47| Thank you. We have a motion on the floor to table this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5087)|

| 1:24:53| We have a second by Commissioner Durrett. Do we have any discussion on this substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5093)|
| 1:25:04| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| Thank you, Madam Chair. I mean, I guess we're getting ready to vote on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| so I just wanted to make a few comments before I do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| I appreciate all my colleagues' comments. I was asked today by someone how I intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| to vote on this resolution. You know, my answer was, my intent is that I will support what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5122)|
| 1:25:35| we voted on last week for this reason. I agree with the premise of it. I agree with the premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| of it so strongly that it would be difficult to vote against it because I absolutely wholeheartedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5143)|
| 1:25:50| believe in protecting the innocence of children against sexualization, against being exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5150)|
| 1:25:58| to certain things before it's age-appropriate. I absolutely support that. I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| take a wild guess and say that I believe 11 of the people on this body support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5165)|
| 1:26:14| But, taking this to the level that Sumner County took it, which by the way, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| really care what Sumner County does. Sumner County is not Knox County. It's not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| in East Tennessee. What scares me is I think there are many people involved in this who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5182)|
| 1:26:33| have the best intentions. But, I think if you trace this back far enough, you will find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| some ill-advised courses of action, perhaps some misguided intentions. You know, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5200)|
| 1:26:48| in the Constitution and the First Amendment. I believe in the freedom of speech, assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| and religion. I believe in it really, really strongly. And, what bothers me is I'm being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5212)|
| 1:27:01| asked as an elected member of a legislative body to vote to defund, to give Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| to dictate to Knox County to defund something, and I don't know what I'm defunding. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5226)|
| 1:27:13| no specificity as to what I'm voting to constrain Knox County to defund. I'm supposed to cast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5233)|
| 1:27:22| a vote to defund something that somebody else somewhere down the road is going to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| what I defunded. I don't think that's good governing. I don't think that's what I'm sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| in a seat to do. Now, I agree with Commissioner Jay. Substantive steps that we can take, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| be absolutely in support of those to specifically protect children against the kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5258)|
| 1:27:46| that he mentioned, abuse, rape, all of these different things. But, to pass something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5266)|
| 1:27:56| could be weaponized to force Knox County to defund something, and I don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| what yet, whatever in someone's opinion doesn't protect the innocence of children, what if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| that's something that someone deems sexual today, and what if it's C.S. Lewis next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| What if at some point you have people that don't like what Darwin wrote, but then a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| years down the road you've got somebody that doesn't like what some Christian writer wrote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| We're going to take that out of the way. I think this is a dangerous path to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| in this country. And so, while I wholeheartedly support the premise behind this, I can't support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5313)|
| 1:28:42| it in the form as presented in this motion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| Thank you. Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you, Madam Chair. This has been probably a stressful week for a lot of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5329)|
| 1:29:00| with this resolution, not in the form that we don't support protecting kids, but I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5340)|
| 1:29:07| to reiterate what Commissioner Baylor said. I don't know what we're doing. There's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| a specific ask. When I ran for commission, I told my constituents I should be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| back up a vote and be able to explain it. I can't really explain this of something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| we're doing. We're just protecting kids, which I have three grown sons and two grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| and I would walk to the ends of the earth like anybody would to protect them, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| don't know in this resolution what that's doing. I've talked to my sons about it. Sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5374)|
| 1:29:42| I bounce ideas off of them, and I've really thought about this a lot, and it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5382)|
| 1:29:54| bothered me because I have felt like this has definitely been a politicized situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| at this point, and I think we can all agree, since 2020, the polarization of politics is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5403)|
| 1:30:15| kind of out of control at this point. You know, somebody actually said this week to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5415)|
| 1:30:27| me that why did Commissioner Schoenmaker or Commissioner Jay ask the questions last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5427)|
| 1:30:39| because it was like we shouldn't have asked questions. And we, on the other hand, get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| in trouble when we pass something on consent and we don't ask questions. We get emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| because everybody gets mad because we didn't discuss it. So that kind of, as a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| kind of puts you in a rock and a hard place because you're trying to do the work of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5455)|
| 1:31:01| And, you know, I represent 55,000 to 60,000 people with 55,000 to 60,000 different opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5461)|
| 1:31:09| views, religions, social standings, everything. And I would just like this resolution to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5469)|
| 1:31:19| something, and I guess this is a great time to ask the maker of the resolution, what is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5479)|
| 1:31:29| what's kind of the end goal of this resolution? What, because the emails that I've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5489)|
| 1:31:37| have been please vote for this because we don't need our kids going to drag shows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5497)|
| 1:31:45| reading books that we don't agree with. Is that the intent that this resolution is going for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| No, it's not. This resolution is about spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5511)|
| 1:31:59| Okay. So that kind of gets you to where you can do whatever you want with your own, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| your home, in your household, but the county should not use taxpayer money to subsidize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| it. That's all it's about. Are there particular areas that we're spending the money that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5530)|
| 1:32:17| could have been in that resolution? Any activities that would be defined by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5537)|
| 1:32:25| Whatever our laws hold is decent or indecent. That's defined by Tennessee state law. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| So if there's anything that's outside of that, that is what this resolution would cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| Okay. If you want an example, that would be at a drag show where they're doing sexually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| explicit acts, that the county should not subsidize that. Okay. Are we subsidizing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5565)|
| 1:32:53| I'm asking the question because if a drag show has that at Tennessee theater, we do give money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| to Tennessee theater. It's not for the drag show, which kind of gets into, now we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| really splitting hairs. And that's where my concern is. I'm just going to read something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5587)|
| 1:33:14| because my thoughts have kind of been all over the place with this. Because I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| like Commissioner Durrett said, I don't want to come across that I don't want to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| kids. Anybody that knows me knows that, you know, I would stand in the line of a bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| for my kids and my grandchildren, hands down. But, you know, we get into a real slippery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5611)|
| 1:33:38| slope when we start telling parents how to parent. That's kind of their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| And as a parent, a grandparent, you know, I wouldn't let Savannah read certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5624)|
| 1:33:53| and do certain things and go certain places because that's our belief system. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| our responsibility as parents and grandparents to Savannah. And I think that's where I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| getting really kind of confused because I am a Republican who is conservative and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5644)|
| 1:34:11| also believes in smaller government. And we get to a real situation when the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| starts overreaching and telling parents what they can and can't do with their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| That's not what this resolution does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| But I don't know what it does. That's my point. So I'm going to, because we could probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| go on all night with it, but I am going to read today what I really felt was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| to say. This was written in a speech that he did, probably one of my favorite presidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5678)|
| 1:34:50| and probably a lot of the Republicans' favorite president, Ronald Reagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| to do the same. One day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| children's children what it was like in the United States where men were free. And I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| want to ever have to explain to Savannah what it used to be like to have freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5717)|
| 1:35:24| And I am going to piggyback off Commissioner Durrett. When she said, and there are people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5724)|
| 1:35:32| out in this audience right now that I stood shoulder to shoulder with in 2020. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| wanted to wear a mask, you wear a mask. You just can't tell me I'm going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| If I would have had my kids in public school, they're all grown, I probably would have pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| them out. Because I believe that that is a parent's responsibility and a parent's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5748)|
| 1:35:55| and not to have the government telling them what they can and can't do. Does that mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5755)|
| 1:36:00| that I want perverse sexual activity? No. But we cannot legislate as a Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| Commission morality or parenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| Thank you for that. I want to say I appreciate everyone's words, including the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| tonight and my fellow commissioners. I'm not going to say the same thing that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| else said up here, the press, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Jay, Commissioner Buechler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| Commissioner Ulster. I agree with your words. I just feel convicted in this moment to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5796)|
| 1:36:49| people that we were all created in God's image. All. That's the LBGQ community. That's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5809)|
| 1:37:04| black community. The brown community. All communities. So while you want to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5824)|
| 1:37:15| and walk out, that's fine. Because the great commission said, love your neighbor as yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| That's what it said. First it said, love your God with all your heart, your mind, and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| soul. That's Bible. The second part, love your neighbor as yourself. We only have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5845)|
| 1:37:32| freaking conversation because we let hate root up in our hearts. And I'm about tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| of it. I'm complete. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| Thank you. Do I see any other lights? I would like to comment on this also before we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5864)|
| 1:37:54| to vote. I strongly, strongly echo Commissioner Buechler's words and his thoughts. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5874)|
| 1:38:08| in place a law in the state of Tennessee that we currently follow or must follow in regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5888)|
| 1:38:21| to lewd and indecent behavior and what is and what is not allowed for children. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| is already in place. I'm strongly feeling like the intent of this is to an attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5907)|
| 1:38:42| protect our young people by this very broad statement that is subject to much interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5922)|
| 1:38:52| and much vagueness in the way that it is worded. Because we've probably got as many opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5932)|
| 1:39:01| as we do commissioners up here as far as what might be considered contributing to sexualization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5941)|
| 1:39:11| of our children and monies that we fund programs with. I mean, and it goes to another comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5951)|
| 1:39:22| that was made, what you might feel okay, I might not feel okay with. I think we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5962)|
| 1:39:30| much, much better served by targeting or targeting, identifying each commissioner when appropriations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5970)|
| 1:39:42| come before us. If there is a situation where you feel like an amount of money is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| to a program or anything in this county that supports that type of behavior, then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=5989)|
| 1:40:00| is when it is appropriate to bring the subject of Knox County taxpayer money to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6000)|
| 1:40:09| for us to make a decision about whether to include or not include in appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6009)|
| 1:40:17| I was nervous about the resolution to begin with since your amendment. I just, I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6017)|
| 1:40:29| struggle with moving forward in its current motion, I mean in its current form and do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6029)|
| 1:40:39| think there might be some wisdom at least at this point in time in tabling this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| and bringing it back in a form that we can all feel certain will not infringe on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6045)|
| 1:40:56| way each of us might feel or opinions each of us might have. Again, it has nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6056)|
| 1:41:07| do with our opinion about sexualization of children. I mean, again, that, at least to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| everyone on this commission, that is, I hate to be so shallow, it is a no-brainer. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| of course we are not going to do anything that is going to support that. If we are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| fact doing that, then I would like that particular area to be brought to us as a commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| be able to discuss and make decisions on and move forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| All right, seeing no other lights, to review, we have a proper amended motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6102)|
| 1:41:55| by Lee. We also have a proper substitute motion brought after the amended motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6115)|
| 1:42:03| Jay. Seeing no other lights or no other discussion, I would like to proceed with a roll call vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6123)|
| 1:42:13| then on the substitute motion to table the amendment, the amended amendment that is presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6133)|
| 1:42:21| by Commissioner Lee. And if we could start that in District 1, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6141)|

| 1:42:43| No. Commissioner Beeler? Aye. Commissioner Daly? Aye. Commissioner Jay? Aye. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| Frazier? Aye. The substitute motion passes by a count of 9-4-1 against. Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6170)|
| 1:43:10| we have three more non-consent items and we also have two signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6190)|
| 1:43:26| Is the will of the Board to adjourn and take a 15-minute break and go into zoning or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6206)|
| 1:43:34| you want to push forward and move into zoning immediately? Commissioner Beeler? Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| Madam Chair. I might suggest that we push through and then perhaps start zoning after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| a break. All right. Is that agreeable? All right. Next agenda item, please. Resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6225)|

| 1:44:10| see a motion? Motion approved. Second. Motion by Daly, second by Oster. Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| All those in favor? Aye. Oh, I apologize. I apologize. Commissioner Schoonmaker? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| you, Madam Chair. Just to clarify, what we're doing with this resolution, how does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6266)|
| 1:44:33| correspond with the ordinance on first reading? And I guess the... So, yes. There are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6273)|
| 1:44:46| sides of the same coin. We have this rule in the merit system rules and we have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| in the ordinance. So, to effect what is being attempted here, you have to amend them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| Great. Thank you. I wanted to have that for the record. The other question is, are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| then also adopting what Tennessee Code Title 8, Chapter 8, Part 4 is as part of the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6302)|
| 1:45:11| then? Do you have that? Nobody's asked me that question, so I'm not sure what that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| is. Because there's several documents, some created by County Technical Assistance Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| regarding public employee political activity, but the Tennessee Code that caught my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| was, it says, any person violating this section shall be dismissed from service by the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6332)|
| 1:45:39| So, if somebody gets caught as an employee of the Sheriff's Department during work hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6339)|
| 1:45:47| campaigning, then they can be dismissed from their job. Is that going to be part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| Yeah, and that's part of the rule as I understand it as well. They still can't do it while they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| on the job. They can't wear their uniform. It's an after hours kind of thing. But they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| do understand that they can lose employment if they do that? They should all know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| now in the course of the public hearing, and I'm sure that they will be instructed about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| that by the Sheriff's Department as well. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Any other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| questions? We have a proper motion on the floor by Daly, seconded by Oster. All those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=6380)|

| 2:00:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| Seeing no other lights, Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| Okay. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| I would make a motion to approve the Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| We have a motion on the floor by Lee, second by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7241)|
| 2:00:45| Seeing no lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7248)|

| 2:00:52| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| Item number 57, 8-F-23-RZ, request of CMH Homes, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7255)|
| 2:01:02| for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| properties located at 2120 and 2116 Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| parcel ID 14810804 and 10806 in the 9th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7272)|
| 2:01:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| Mr. Mullins, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant, CMH Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| I see two people that wish to speak, and you both have been sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| The applicant will have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| Then the opposition will also have five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| and the applicant can respond for a few minutes afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Go ahead, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| This is a rezoning request for what we asked for at the planning commission stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| and what the planning staff and planning commission recommended was five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| I've spoken with most of you, and I hope most of you caught me when I wasn't on pain medicines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| when I did speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| But we are now asking to reduce our application to 3.7 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7339)|
| 2:02:27| because between the planning commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| and now we've been able to put together a site plan that is going to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| pending the results of this rezoning, by planning commission in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| So we're looking to reduce our request to 3.7 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7360)|
| 2:02:45| We spent a great deal of time speaking with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| both a larger neighborhood meeting in August that I was unable to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| but representatives of Clayton Homes and Commissioner Daley was able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| And the four neighbors that are to the south of this property that are most directly affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7379)|
| 2:03:05| because they have an easement that runs through this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| and that easement will remain throughout the development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| We've been working with them regarding their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| and how we can protect their easement rights both during construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| and after the subdivision has been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| This is in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Our next-door neighbor to the east is South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Bonnie Kate Elementary is 100 yards or so to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7412)|
| 2:03:40| The sector plan is in place for low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| which in the county means anywhere between one and five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| 3.7 is right in the middle of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| In fact, if you look at the six closest planned residential zonings around this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7430)|
| 2:03:57| you're going to see a range of five dwelling units an acre on the other side of South Doyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| four dwelling units an acre across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| and then three dwelling units an acre a little further south and a little further west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| And you average those together, that's 3.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| So 3.7 is right in line with what's developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7457)|
| 2:04:24| It's accessed by Tipton Station Road, which is a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| It has 20 feet of pavement and 40 feet right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| There is a sidewalk that runs on the south side of Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| It runs just to the property right before Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| I had a conversation with Commissioner Frazier about the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| and it looks like that sidewalk ends right before Bonnie Kate Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| We are talking to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| We'll have internal sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| We're talking to the school system about locating a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| or a path from our property directly to South Doyle right next to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| The exact location of that I don't think we've worked out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| Anywhere in the county during peak hours, school hours, you're going to have bad traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| and this is no exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| Traffic does back up there during school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| It backs up in West Knoxville where I drop my kids off at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| But I did reach out to Commissioner Snowden or Director Snowden about the level of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| and it was estimated at five units an acre that we'd be putting about 1,000 additional vehicles on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7533)|
| 2:05:43| It was Director Snowden's opinion that Tipton Station could manage that additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7543)|
| 2:05:49| Reducing that down to 3.7 is going to be less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| I don't know what exactly those numbers are, but that's something that the road can manage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7552)|
| 2:06:01| and I think there's some people that are going to speak that would encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| that there may be some infrastructure projects in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| But when we're looking at the type of density for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| this is right in line with what the sector plan and the growth policy plan allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7577)|
| 2:06:25| We are going to continue to work with the neighbors with the site plan as it comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| about what to do with the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| I don't think we've got all the details worked out on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| but we are trying to be very intentional with our conversations with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| and trying to be a really good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| So it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| You have a piece of property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7607)|
| 2:06:48| It's kind of an island of agricultural zoning around PR zones right next to a high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7608)|
| 2:06:55| It's going to get developed at some point, and I think we have a local company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| It's been local here for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| It has people invested in the community, and the density makes sense for this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| and we'd ask that you follow Planning Commission's recommendation and vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7632)|
| 2:07:13| I also have some representatives from Clayton that can answer any questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7637)|
| 2:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| I will get your recommendation in a moment, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7640)|
| 2:07:26| and I'd like opposition to come forward and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7646)|
| 2:07:35| If you'd state your name and address, please, and you have five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7655)|
| 2:07:41| Patty King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| I live on Tipton Station in Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| You guys have my address on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| Excuse me one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| Could we start the clock, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7671)|
| 2:07:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7672)|
| 2:07:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7673)|
| 2:07:54| I'm talking against this development because I live on Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| I live about three miles from where this development is coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7677)|
| 2:08:02| and the traffic on Tipton Station during school zone time and also during rush hour is horrendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7682)|
| 2:08:09| I can't get out of my driveway half the time because if there is an accident on Chapman Highway right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| they do swing them through Tipton Station to Pick and Gap and then back down onto Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7696)|
| 2:08:22| School time, when you're sitting, when you're going down towards John Sevier off Tipton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7702)|
| 2:08:28| you cannot get past Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| They block the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Bonnie Kate is blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| You cannot get around school pickup at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| I don't know how many of you commissioners ever drove down Tipton Station during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7718)|
| 2:08:42| but you can't get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| Emergency vehicles would not be able to get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| I don't want this property because it also is right next to South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| It's going to cause overcrowding to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| We have three other developments that are still being developed that are feeding into this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7738)|
| 2:09:03| We have one high school, one middle school in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7743)|
| 2:09:09| They are going to overcrowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| I keep hearing, no, they're not, no, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| I have friends who have a senior at South Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| They say the teacher-to-student ratio is outrageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| I'm Spencer Proctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7766)|
| 2:09:27| I live at 2122 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I'm one of the four neighbors that lives adjacent to the property being proposed of a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| My specific opposition is more for the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| The initial opposition through the Planning Commission was the, I do oppose the entirety of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| but as Mr. Mullins has said, we've worked together, and I'm okay with their 3.7 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7784)|
| 2:09:52| I wanted to use just a few minutes, if it's okay with you all, to address my concerns at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7792)|
| 2:09:59| As I studied the 72-page sector plan for South County, I hear a lot, both in Planning Commission and in this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7799)|
| 2:10:08| it's referenced regularly, which is great to have the sector plan, and I know that was a voted-on document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| and I feel that it was voted on as an entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| But when we look at the sector plan, there's a five-year and a 15-year plan included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| and the amount of things that have not even been touched on those plans is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| The things that have been touched are privatized money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| and so we've approved neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and we haven't addressed the infrastructure issues with Tipton Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| The LOS of Tipton Station wasn't horrible in 2012 when they addressed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| but for John Sevier, it was already at a D on a scale down from A to F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| It was already at a D on John Sevier, and a John Sevier hasn't been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7849)|
| 2:10:53| In that same sector plan, it's called for adjustments, improvements to John Sevier by 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7853)|
| 2:10:59| and those have not begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Money hasn't been designated for that, to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| And so my request in standing here with you is I understand, and I should speak only for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7864)|
| 2:11:11| I understand that growth and expansion is inevitable and necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| but that growth strategically is the wisest plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| And so if we're looking at the community, just to say there is an infrastructure in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7881)|
| 2:11:25| because there are sidewalks and a library I think is missing the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| I think that there are, as mentioned, the traffic is a problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| This is between school zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| To exit this neighborhood, you cannot avoid a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7896)|
| 2:11:39| It is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| There's not a back road, no way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| You're in a school zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| The traffic mentioned by Mr. Mullins is this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| but that doesn't include the 33 homes across the street that are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| the 176 homes off John Sevier Highway that are directly down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| and among many, many, many more in this Chapman Highway corridor that have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| So the concerns that I feel I do represent a lot of community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| even in the meeting that was mentioned with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| I'm not sure that anybody at that community meeting was in favor of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| and the Planning Commission has a comment section that there were 88 comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| 80 of them opposed, 8 of them for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| And I'll just speak to my experience with the Planning Commission that I stood up and spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7942)|
| 2:12:27| and honestly felt relatively dismissed and unheard in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| and I feel like this is a better body to speak to because you are elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| So I'm asking and happy to clarify any thoughts or questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7956)|
| 2:12:41| but in looking at that sector plan that is referenced regularly as a standard by which we operate on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| there's not many things that are being touched outside of privatized money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| So we would very much like for you to consider the expansion and improvement of Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| the expansion and improvement of John Sevier Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| so that things like traffic and school overcrowding are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| I know that those things are in the works and years down the road maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| but we come up against them quickly when houses are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| So those are the main concerns, and I would, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| part of the issues that I've talked to Commissioner Daley about is that the community is able to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=7996)|
| 2:13:24| in a lot of these conversations, but it's difficult to know how and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| And when this sector plan was approved, I was graduating college, not married yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| not with my three children, haven't moved onto the property that I now own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8012)|
| 2:13:35| That was a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| And so to approve things and stand by them when the community that is now deeply involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| was not able to be involved during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| I feel like there should be quicker updates or honest changes to sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8025)|
| 2:13:50| when things are not being addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| Thank you. Thank you so much for speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| Did you have a brief comment, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| Just briefly, I appreciate Mr. Proctor and Ms. Keene's comments, and the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8044)|
| 2:14:09| Ms. Frazier and I spoke, Commissioner Frazier and I spoke about as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| and I wasn't able to actually reach out to South Doyle and Bonnie Kate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| to see what their capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| But I do know the planning staff, when they put their reports together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| they have a method that's derived from data that I think they share with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8067)|
| 2:14:35| about what the student yield would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| And at five units an acre, we were looking at 22 students at build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8077)|
| 2:14:41| among three different schools is what they had estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| If that's directly proportional to breaking it down to 3.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| we're looking at 16 to 17 students over three schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8091)|
| 2:14:57| And that's not just an immediate dump of 16, 17 students into the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| That's kind of matriculated over time, and that doesn't account for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| that move through the school system as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| So I'd be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| I understand the frustration about some of the infrastructure out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8114)|
| 2:15:19| I have to rely upon my conversations with Mr. Snowden that says that tipped in station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| the level of service would still be within an acceptable level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| average trips per day with this development, even at the five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| much less the 3.7 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| So I would be happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| but still appreciate if you would approve this. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| Director Brooks, would you please read the recommendation for this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the PR plan residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| because it's compatible with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| and supported by a close proximity to community facilities by a vote of 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| Seeing no other lights, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| First of all, I want to thank Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| Spencer's been a voice of reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8178)|
| 2:16:21| He's done a lot of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| He has met with CMH Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| He's met with Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| Yes, we do have some problems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| Yes, we do have tipped in station road that is really our only east-west road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| besides Governor John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Correct, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| It is on a plan to widen, but once we get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| who knows when we're going to get to that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| It will be wide one of these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| I'll soon be 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| I don't know if I'll see it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| Hopefully I'll see it in the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8217)|
| 2:17:02| Yes, John Sevier has been spoken about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| John Sevier, Jim's lovely wife, Miss Amanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8224)|
| 2:17:12| There's going to be some work done there to improve some intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8232)|
| 2:17:17| I'm trying to get them TDOT not to spend money on the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| Go ahead and widen from Alcoa Highway to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| and that will reduce 80% of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| 80% of the traffic gets off at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8250)|
| 2:17:33| You don't need to expand John Sevier Highway all the way to Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| I think they're very receptive about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| but it takes seven years, if I'm not correct, to start a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| after they get their funding going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| So, yes, John Sevier is going to be four lanes, hopefully sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8267)|
| 2:17:54| We talk about overcrowding at the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| Bonnie Kate, yes, Bonnie Kate is overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| It's on the South Knoxville plan to be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| Where we're going to expand it is going to be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| Do we lose the old facade of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8288)|
| 2:18:14| or do we take the teacher's parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8294)|
| 2:18:17| That's going to be a question, but it's in the plans to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| New Hope Elementary, we're going to get 1,000-student elementary school here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| I'm pushing for 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| I'm asking the mayor to move it up to 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| It's in the plans, and we do have a lot of growth there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8311)|
| 2:18:36| The high school is not overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| The high school can handle 400 more students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| We're at less than 1,000 in the 900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| Middle school is getting close, but I think we've got room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8325)|
| 2:18:51| If we had to expand the middle school, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| So, yeah, would I like to see things the way they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| Were? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| I've been there 60-some-odd years, 60 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| So I've known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| I've been there when a lot of people's houses weren't built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8348)|
| 2:19:12| My house and the other two houses were only houses on my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8352)|
| 2:19:17| That's not that way anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| The sidewalk, we approved tonight on the consent on the education calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8361)|
| 2:19:29| That's been approved, so we'll get on that real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8369)|
| 2:19:32| So hopefully by Mr. Snowden, maybe three months, you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| we can have that in there in three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| So that sidewalk will extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| The missing link is no longer going to be a missing link there for Bonnie Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| So I'm asking, the concept plan calls for 72, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8387)|
| 2:19:59| but we're asking 3.7, which is 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| Ben, does that include the farmhouse and the rancher in that 74?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8402)|
| 2:20:10| The concept plan includes the farmhouse and the rancher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8410)|
| 2:20:15| The 3.7 is just the concept plan could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| We're still working with them about maybe what to do with the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8420)|
| 2:20:24| whether that can be moved or abandoned at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| So that gives us a little bit of leeway one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8427)|
| 2:20:31| But if the concept plan was approved moving forward with what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| it would be 71 total, including the two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| Mr. Snowden, do you think that a turn lane right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| could be put there to help some of the traffic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| It will not help the Bonnie Kate traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| The only way to help the Bonnie Kate traffic is four-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8452)|
| 2:20:55| and we're not going to be able to do that anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| We had asked the applicant, and Ben may know about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| I haven't seen it, to do a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| to look at the warrants for those auxiliary turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| for the right-turn de-sale and the left-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| I haven't seen that study yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| It wasn't going to be a full-blown study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| but just an analysis of those auxiliary lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| So I unfortunately don't have that information just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8480)|
| 2:21:25| It would benefit the new development there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| if there was a right-hand turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8490)|
| 2:21:32| I'm sure that you all would not have a problem putting it right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8492)|
| 2:21:38| We can't have a right out, of course, but we can have a right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8498)|
| 2:21:42| If it warrants calls, I trust the highway department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| They know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| That's about all the questions I see some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| Before I make a motion, I'll turn it over to the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you. Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| Commissioner Daley asked some of the questions I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| Director Snowden, is Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| is it on the road improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| and can you tell me what the timeline is for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| If so or if not, can it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| It has shown up on previous plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8538)|
| 2:22:22| It was not identified as part of the advanced NOx process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| They looked at kind of a little smaller segment of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8546)|
| 2:22:30| Right now, we've got a count station close by this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| It shows about 4,000 vehicles per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| With the width that the current roadway has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8560)|
| 2:22:43| which probably varies between 10 and 11 foot lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| so you're probably 20 to 22 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8565)|
| 2:22:50| it would be something that in the absence of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| which we don't see also here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| that it would be sometime many, many years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| It would probably be in excess of 10 years before we looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| I think Commissioner Daley makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| We are working with TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| and think the expansion of Johnsonville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| from Chapman Highway to Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| especially with the completion of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| would bring a whole lot of value to that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| You did state that you're going to request a traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| Can you just kind of briefly discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8606)|
| 2:23:29| what are the types of things that we could possibly require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8609)|
| 2:23:33| of the applicant to improve Tittson Station Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8613)|
| 2:23:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| One of the things that we asked them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| is obviously we want to make sure that their line of sight is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| which we think it probably is, but we want to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8623)|
| 2:23:46| Then when we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| we certainly want to make sure that their development traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| both the slowing rights and the stopping lefts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| are outside of the through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| to avoid what these folks are talking about as far as additional delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8640)|
| 2:24:06| We have asked them to do a traffic analysis of that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| and then look at our access control policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8651)|
| 2:24:14| to see if it complies with the warrants for the right and the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| If it does, we would require that of them in their concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| that would be heard by Planning Commission in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| Mr. Mullins, you plan to cluster most of these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| because of the environmental constraints with that blue line stream, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8672)|
| 2:24:38| When you say cluster, we're making a traditional subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| I think the lots vary between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| The existing lots are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| There are some environmental constraints to the west of the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| where there's some flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| There's a floodway zone there as well that we'll have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| But yes, it's going to be trying to avoid the more difficult areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| and put the lots where they make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| Commissioner Daley, I tried to get him to help us out with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| all the way down Tipton Station, but he didn't go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| This question is for Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| Is it my understanding that you've already filed a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| with Knox Planning for the October meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| There's a concept plan that is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| The staff's recommendation isn't out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| so there's still room to work on that with what the county wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| And you're identifying on that plan 71 building units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| plus two additional existing structures for a total of 73?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| I think it's a total of 71 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8752)|
| 2:25:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| Is that including the two houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| That includes the two houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| There's a pre-1900 farmhouse and a 1960s rancher on the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| now that are going to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8762)|
| 2:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| So if I'm doing my math correctly, that's 3.5 dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| based on your concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| I'll trust your math more than I trust my math, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| So I guess if you've already filed a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| why would you want to ask for a higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| which would be closer to 76 lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| I think it would be 74 lots with 3.7 on it is what I did the math before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| Is it 20.67?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| 20.67.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| And the reason for that, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| is we're still working with the neighbors about potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| whether they would be willing to abandon the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| and use the public roads or relocate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| and that gives us some more room to revise that concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8802)|
| 2:26:46| It might give us more room to address the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| needed for some of the improvements that the county may recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| after our traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8818)|
| 2:27:01| Seeing no other lines, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Good questions, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| There's more negotiations going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| so that's why we're asking for the 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| And Clayton Holmes and Ben,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| I asked you to work with Spencer, Mr. Proctor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8836)|
| 2:27:20| and especially on the concept plan coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| on the screening, the vegetation, type of screening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| make a good screening and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| Like I say, I wish that, you know, a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| they don't get along too well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| But Spencer's been awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| He's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| He's been the go-between between the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| And Spencer and I have had a lot of texting and calling each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| So I think Spencer's learned a little bit about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| and sector plans and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| So I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=8873)|

| 2:30:10| Being, Mr. Ward, that you're in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| I see that this is just a little over an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| Could you share with me your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9015)|
| 2:30:18| It's actually the homeowner had requested this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9018)|
| 2:30:21| The property is currently zoned agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| which would require one acre minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| They're wanting to create a lot in the rear for their daughter, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| to construct a house on, and that was the reason for the change to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9029)|
| 2:30:34| zoning was to allow the additional lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9034)|
| 2:30:38| And it is on sanitary sewer at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| which is with agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9041)|
| 2:30:44| that's why you get the one acre minimum is because of the wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9044)|
| 2:30:47| and the septic requirement, which is no longer an issue with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9052)|

| 2:32:39| but the subdivision is zoned RAE, which does not allow any second dwelling on a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9159)|
| 2:32:47| So my request is to change to RA, which would allow use on or permit on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9167)|
| 2:32:55| use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9175)|

| 2:33:17| Can you explain what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| We don't have a lot of it in the county, but this zone is exclusively residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9200)|
| 2:33:25| You'll notice in some of the other zones that other types of uses are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9205)|
| 2:33:29| For instance, like in the RA zone, you can have churches and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9209)|
| 2:33:35| and gardening and horticulture, public golf courses, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| But in the RAE, it is exclusively residential uses only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9218)|
| 2:33:43| Houses, accessory uses, public utilities, it is very limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9223)|
| 2:33:53| So accessory buildings with a residence is allowed in RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| RA and not RAE, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9237)|
| 2:34:03| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| I can't even talk, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9249)|
| 2:34:10| Director Brooks, would an additional septic system need to support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9250)|
| 2:34:15| I know because we're going outside of the zoning in the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9255)|
| 2:34:20| if we approve this, I'm concerned about the capacity of the septic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9260)|
| 2:34:27| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Director Snowden, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| If approved and approved by Planning Commissioner, Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| before we would issue a building permit for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| we would require the Health Department certify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| that there was adequate supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| I actually have a permit for a second septic system from the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9284)|
| 2:34:49| That was some of the pre-work that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9291)|
| 2:34:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| I'm probably one of the few commissioners that knows what an RAE zone is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9302)|
| 2:35:07| just because of my previous tenure as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9307)|
| 2:35:15| with the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| This zoning designation is very unique in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9318)|
| 2:35:23| and it was originally set up probably 50, 60 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9323)|
| 2:35:27| for those communities where it would be basically very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| very low-density residentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| In fact, if you look at the street, it's only 15 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9335)|
| 2:35:40| So that should tell you right away that this is not a high-volume neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| The other thing is, because he's right on the Clinch River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| this whole community was designated just that kind of neat area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| And the requirements are that you could only have your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| and any accessory building cover 30% of the lot, which is amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9358)|
| 2:36:05| So it was designed to give that open area around the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9365)|
| 2:36:10| And, of course, the staff recommended denial of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9370)|
| 2:36:15| and it's probably because they're very familiar with RAE zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| I don't think the planning commissioners probably have ever heard of this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| just like Commissioner Jay had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| So I'd be in favor of denying this because you're kind of interrupting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9386)|
| 2:36:31| what is already designated for that community that has probably been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| for, I'm guessing, probably 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9396)|
| 2:36:42| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| This is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| I'm very familiar with Birchfield Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9408)|
| 2:36:50| I am your commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| I went out twice and tried to catch you at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9412)|
| 2:36:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9415)|
| 2:36:56| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9416)|
| 2:36:57| And you'll just have to ask for permission after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9417)|
| 2:37:01| I did walk through your carport and look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| If I may, where is that garage apartment going to be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9427)|
| 2:37:13| Okay, so the original lot was actually two lots that the previous owner had purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| and then he combined them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| When you look at the house, it's the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9444)|
| 2:37:25| So it's downhill from the house to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| Yes, that was kind of what I envisioned when I saw there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9450)|
| 2:37:34| To your point, Commissioner Schoonmaker, if you drive out through that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9454)|
| 2:37:39| there are some folks out there that have got some storage buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| that are nearly the size of another apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9464)|
| 2:37:47| It's kind of a mixture of homes and outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9467)|
| 2:37:59| But I absolutely can envision what it is that you're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9479)|
| 2:38:04| and do not have an issue with what you're trying to do on your property in your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9484)|
| 2:38:12| So I'd like to go ahead and request that we approve the rezoning from RAE to RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| because it is, in fact, very consistent with what already exists in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9500)|
| 2:38:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| We have a motion on the floor by Hill, a second by Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9508)|
| 2:38:32| Seeing no other lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9515)|
| 2:38:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9519)|
| 2:38:40| Thank you, sir, and good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9522)|

| 2:38:50| Number 60 is 8-K-23-RZ, request of Sarah Miller for rezoning from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9530)|
| 2:38:57| to RA low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9537)|

| 2:39:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| May I have your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| My name is Kathy McBride, 1115 Kelly Farmway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9558)|
| 2:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9563)|
| 2:39:24| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| Seeing none, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9567)|
| 2:39:32| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the RA low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9572)|
| 2:39:35| residential zone because it is consistent with the sector plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| and will allow development compatible with the surrounding land uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| and zoning pattern by vote of 13-0 consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9582)|
| 2:39:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| Would you like to speak to your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| What I'm looking at doing is dividing my property so that my son can afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| to build a home with the price of houses now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| so it would just be one additional unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| and we would divide the property in half, so it would be two half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9598)|
| 2:40:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| The total right now is one acre, so it would be five and a half acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9605)|
| 2:40:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| Are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| Seeing none, I'd like to – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| Director Scudamore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| In the application that was accepted by Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| it says that the utilities, both the sewer and water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| are provided by the Clinton Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9636)|
| 2:40:38| Who are your utilities, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| LCB for electric and First Utilities District for water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9640)|
| 2:40:45| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Sorry about that error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| So is Planning still looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9649)|
| 2:40:53| or they agree with what the applicant is saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9653)|
| 2:40:57| I was looking at what was on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| I would trust the applicant to know what their utility providers are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| There might have been just an error on the application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9667)|
| 2:41:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9671)|

| 2:41:22| with this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| So I just want to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| It's a private road, so I'm a tenth of a mile off of Snyder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9686)|
| 2:41:31| and there's a home behind me, so there's no roads that would affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9691)|

| 2:42:38| at 1412 Chert Pit Road, parcel ID 105114 in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9758)|
| 2:42:45| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9765)|
| 2:42:52| This was actually deferred last month because of failure of the applicant to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| Commissioner Oster, do you have any information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| I don't have any updates, and I actually wanted to ask Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| have we heard from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| We have not, but I know that our staff did follow up with Mr. Hargrove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9789)|
| 2:43:15| confirmed that the email was correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| and then sent another letter to them to let them know they needed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9800)|
| 2:43:22| There again, we're still kind of at a loss, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9802)|
| 2:43:25| on the number of what he's wanting to do even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9805)|
| 2:43:30| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9810)|
| 2:43:31| Besides what's in the, because it was passed on consent at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9811)|
| 2:43:37| We could make some speculation, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Yeah, I'm kind of at a loss here since he's not shown up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9820)|
| 2:43:45| he's not had any communication with me or planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| so I think this is where I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| I don't really feel like I need to defer it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| So I think that I'll probably make a motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9839)|
| 2:44:06| Do I deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9846)|

| 2:44:23| and we have no further information on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9863)|

| 2:44:44| Yes, we need to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9884)|
| 2:44:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| Proper motions on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9888)|

| 2:45:04| or amendments to Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230925?start=9904)|
