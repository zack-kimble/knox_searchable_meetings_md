| 0:00:31| It is five o'clock and we will now call the City Council workshop meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=31)|
| 0:00:37| We'll first start with the Pledge of Allegiance led by Council Member Janet Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=37)|
| 0:00:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=54)|
| 0:01:24| Thank you all for making time to attend this workshop today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| Those of you who are in the audience, those who will be presenting, and those watching at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| today we will be having a presentation on the Co-Response Pilot Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| And so at this point, I will turn it over to Erin Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=95)|
| 0:01:39| who is the Chief Policy Officer and Deputy to Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| I have a question before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Just if we could understand a bit more about the format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| Are we waiting until the end for questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| If the public has questions, will we have an opportunity to ask those throughout the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| We do have public forum at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| It will be at Council's discretion, even though we do have it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Council can ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| We'll let Ms. Gill maybe just kind of give us an overview of the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| I mean of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| but I'm sure she would not be opposed for Council to ask questions as we go through as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| I think one suggestion I had for the setup of today's workshop was that we allowed the public to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| similar to how this was done with the recode workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| And so I thought it might be possible if we informed the public that if they had questions also during the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=151)|
| 0:02:39| that they could present them to Council, maybe line up at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| Would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| We did not discuss that in advance, and that is not outside of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| It's not been the decorum that we followed to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So I would suggest, unless Council members feel otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| that we would keep the public questions at the end, the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| Unless there is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| So it looks like Council...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| I would also recommend that we let them get through the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| because sometimes we stop and ask questions that they're getting to in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| That might be helpful this time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| So we're going to go ahead at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| We'll turn it over to you, Deputy Chief Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| We will have public forum at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| Council, if you do have a pressing question, I think you go ahead and ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| Ms. Gill can, or whoever is presenting at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| can advise whether or not that answer is coming up later in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| Councilwoman Parker, did that answer all of your questions and concerns that you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| It definitely answered my question, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Well, thank you, Council, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| for inviting us to talk with you tonight about the co-response program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| which we have discussed several times in meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and I know that we have spoken with many of you as you've had questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| since we launched this program last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| We're excited to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| and I specifically want to recognize some of the members of the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| both who are sitting beside us here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| but also those other teammates on the administration who have helped think through this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| as well as many others that relate to public safety that we've had a chance to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| and will continue to be discussing as we move through the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| So to my left here, we have Leanne Heumann-Hilliard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| who is the Regional Clinical Vice President at the McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| I'm also joined by Candice Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| who is the Senior Director of Adult Intensive Outpatient Services at McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| and Sergeant Thomas Clinton, who many of you have met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| He's with KPD and is the co-response lead over at the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| In addition, Charles Lomax and LaKenya Middlebrook, I believe, are in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| and both of them have been working closely with me and my team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| as we think about public safety responses to a variety of challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| those involving violent crime, those involving mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and thinking about how we can provide effective responses both within city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| as well as within the community of partners that we work with regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| So I want to acknowledge them and thank them for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Just quickly, I'm sorry to cut you off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| but is there a reason why the behavioral health specialist isn't with us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| I will defer to my colleagues at McNabb as it's their employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| who represents that particular role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| If you'd like, I think they're going to talk a little bit more during the presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| about some of that program and how that's structured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| And share with us why we're not able to meet them today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Why don't we go ahead and address that point now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| You know, I think that there's certainly nothing about what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| that wants to present us from putting that person in the forefront of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| I think it's just my role in the organization to speak to programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| on behalf of the center and Candice's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| But we certainly can have her meet with you or have her present if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| That's a lot to ask someone to do in this role and align staff to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| That's kind of scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I think it's very important because the role we're imagining this person playing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| is essentially being able to serve as an authority figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| and be able to address Officer Clinton if they feel like they need to take a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=433)|
| 0:07:22| And so that's one dynamic that is interesting for us to be able to witness here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| I would also just say that it's important when we design programs from the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| that we don't design a program around a specific individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| We're designing a clinical program based on how we could roll it out to any qualified candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=461)|
| 0:07:51| Because we do have people who move on and go into other jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| so we really try to make our programming more about the person served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| and not the person serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So I think that might be playing a little bit of what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| but I hear you and I think we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| And also just to make sure that the specialist is not too intimidated in this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| our evaluation, we're not the supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| our evaluation is not them personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| but to get a better understanding of this new dynamic in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| of a behavioral health specialist and a police officer working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Makes sense. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you to both of you for raising that point and being able to address it early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| So just to really quickly kind of outline what we will go through this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| and to your point, Vice Mayor McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| we have roughly, we think, about a 25-minute presentation that this team will present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| and we welcome questions along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| but of course also welcome to your point, Councilwoman Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| if you desire to hold questions toward the end, we'll follow your lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| But we do have quite a lot of content to get through, I think, that will be very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| We will take you through the history of the co-response program, the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| and how it emerged from a long history of conversations that McNabb has been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| as well as KPD and many other partners through our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| We'll talk about how it functions today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| as well as our goals for the expansion of that program in the next fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| that you've discussed as Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| And you'll also hear an overview of the research that this team has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| related to a variety of different response models that we see operating throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| and in particular what we've learned from other communities who have what's considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| alternative response programs that we have heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| and been researching here at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and what it takes to make those types of programs successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| So without much further ado, I am really going to sit here and listen alongside you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| but I will turn it over now to this great team who will take us through our content tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Can you all hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Hold the mic closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Is this good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Okay, thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| I would like to start off with giving just a little bit of a historical background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=614)|
| 0:10:21| of what I think where we've come from, you know, and where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| When we first started talking about preparing for this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| all of us said that we really think that our community does an excellent job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| in looking at the services and evaluating services that we have for our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| and equally as well I think we do a good job of, you know, identifying our gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| and evaluating them and seeing what we can do to find solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| I think a really good example of this kind of established process happened in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| so I'm going to go back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| In 2015, McNabb was very honored to serve for a pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| Early Diversion Through SAMHSA, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| the federal agency department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| And in that program, what was available to us was technical assistance from the GAINS Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| and the GAINS Center is one of the most prestigious consultative services agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| across the United States in regard to criminal justice programming and reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| So they actually came to Knoxville in December, I think it was December, of 2015 for a two-day workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=697)|
| 0:11:47| And this workshop is called a Sequential Intercept Mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and you'll see some of the information on the slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| And basically what it does is just a community gets together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| and they look at various stages where an individual with behavioral health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| might come into contact with the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| And you look at the services that you have, and then you also look at the gaps that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| So this, like I said, was a two-day workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| We had participating organizations, as you can see, and it was well-attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| We had about 60 individuals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| We had judges, mayors, DA, public defenders, mental health centers, probation, parole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| the chief of police, the sheriff, I mean, just numerous individuals that really were able to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| the services that they had in each of these intercepts and then also identify gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| This is going to be a really busy map that you're going to see next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| That's what came out of our 2015 SIMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| And you can see the intercepts with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| Hold on just one second because I can't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| But I'd like to draw your attention to the five intercepts that we had at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| They were law enforcement was the first to intercept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| The second was initial detention and initial court hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| The third was jail and courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Fourth, reentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| And fifth, community corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| So that was the map of our city in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| What came out of that also was the whole group voted on the top three priorities of gaps that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| And there were strategic goals, objectives, and individuals and agencies that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| to put forth resolutions and try to see if we could get services going for those gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| After 2015, we continued on with a couple of programs that we partnered with, with KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=843)|
| 0:14:14| because we have partnered with them for several programming services for our citizens throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=854)|
| 0:14:23| We also continued our crisis intervention team training that we do about three of those a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| and KPD takes the lead on that with the trainers as co-trainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| And during that time that we were attending a lot of the CIT international conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=875)|
| 0:14:43| that's probably early 2016 is when I started hearing about co-response programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| and I went to about every one I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| We got a lot of data, talked to the behavioral health specialists, talked to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| And so we came back and so we were talking about this, and we identified that as another gap in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| because if we can get to people more quickly and have services at that point, that could just better serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| So I really equate – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| So what happened out of that afterwards in 2017, SAMHSA and the GAINS Center added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| and revised the sequential intercept map to include Intercept Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| So you will see a representation of several programs there for Intercept Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| The last one I would bring your attention to are police and behavioral health collaborations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| Just to read it, police officers can build partnerships with behavioral health agencies along with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=939)|
| 0:15:46| and learn how to interact with individuals experiencing a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| This is what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| We know that if we can get to somebody as quickly as possible, if we can intercept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| if we can respond at that initial stage and serve as first responders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| we've got a better chance of helping that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| It's just a better chance, the opportunity for a positive outcome increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| You know, I equate it with, like, an ambulance service coming up on a car wreck or some kind of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| You know, they stabilize someone, maybe that person is stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| and then they make it to the emergency department to get further care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| They stabilize some people and maybe they can go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| They also stabilize people, or sometimes they save people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| And I've seen that happen even with the co-response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Just the other day, Sergeant Clinton and Lily were on a call where a lady was getting ready to jump off a bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| and because of the expertise of officer safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and the expertise of that behavioral health specialist, they were able to talk her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| I believe they saved a life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, Candice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Can you all hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I'm going to start kind of going into my section here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| and most of what you're going to see here you've already seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| This is basically our data side of things, and I'll talk to most of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| and hopefully I answer some questions for you if you had questions since I wasn't here for that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| Obviously, this is a collaborative partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| I've been involved with the McNabb Center through CIT now since I started working with our homeless population six years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| and noticed that there was a really intense need for mental health services in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| and that I was dealing with a lot of individuals dealing with mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| And I saw that need, and I needed to get more training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| So I got myself involved with the CIT program, put in for the next class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| and I've been working with Candice fairly closely since that time up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| and including both of us presenting at a CIT international conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| which we will be doing again for our second time this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| So it is a partnership, and I feel like I've got a close-knit relationship with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| Our current co-response team structure is a CIT-trained officer, yours truly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| and a master's-level clinician in behavioral health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| There are several different types of co-response models out there where some will be dispatched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| some are ride-along, some are others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Obviously, ours is a ride-along-type method where she is in the car with me every day on shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| and we go to calls together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Our shift currently runs from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which was kind of set forth for the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| because we wanted to have time for follow-ups and time to do the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| kind of getting the basics set up for the pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| because later in the afternoon is usually the busier time for calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| So that gives us some of the morning time to do some of the other stuff that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| As you know, we have one team, and our city is quite large when you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| There's 23 service beats that we have within our KPD system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| That's 23 officers, if not a couple more, on those beats, especially downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| You're talking another five to six officers during that day shift time schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| And we are covering every one of those beats for mental health calls with one team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1148)|
| 0:19:13| That's 104 square miles that we get to drive around every day and answer calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| which is why I feel like there is such a need to help us out by adding some more teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| What is our main service that we're trying to provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| It's an initial assessment and then linkage and referral to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| We have to work within our community and what we have in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| as far as our services can be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| We don't have the luxury of having a mental health hospital here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| so we have to make do with what we have, which I think everyone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| including McNabb Center, would agree we could always use more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| But we are able to link people with services that we currently have set up in our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| Our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| Currently we receive calls through three different fashions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| One is straight through dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| If it's an immediately known, based off the call, that is a mental health crisis call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1200)|
| 0:20:07| we can be dispatched directly to the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| What we've also found is that any call can become a crisis call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| A 16-year-old who has their first wreck may be in a crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| because they're worried what mom and dad might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| We don't determine what a crisis is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| The people that are in the streets and our community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| and our individuals that we come in contact with determine what is a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| So any call could be a crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| It doesn't have to be just someone who is thinking of suicide or hearing voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| It could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| We also, through several of my past connections with service providers in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| especially with the homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| we will get community referrals direct from service providers to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| hey, we could use some help here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Do you care to come out and talk to somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| They're acting erratically, they're having a bad day, whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and we will get direct calls from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Our response immediately is to try to de-escalate the situation, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| ensure the safety of not only the individual that is having a crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| also our other community members that may be standby or bystanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1270)|
| 0:21:20| the community at large, and then also ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| because my main role and main function is to make sure that the co-responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| that she is safe and doing what she can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| without having to look over her shoulder for something to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| I want her focused on her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| There are several dispositions that we can have an outcome for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| and the main one being referral and linkage to resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| That's what we primarily want to do is set people up with resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| There are going to be times that we do transports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| and we can transport to the BHUC, to the CSU, which is our Crisis Stabilization Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1308)|
| 0:21:55| which is a voluntary admittal process, or we have the ER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| which we also have to go to for many extra treatments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| You have to have medical clearance, which means we have to take you to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Like I said earlier, we don't have a mental health hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| so that is our primary place that we have to go for those medical clearances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| to get people into services post the crisis call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| And in limited cases, we do have to take people to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| We are the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And I want to reiterate that by saying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| The ones we are taking to jail are things that we don't have the power to divert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| If someone has a warrant, I can't just say because you're having a mental health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| that you don't go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| You have a warrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| If you're involved in a domestic, which we had a case, it was a domestic assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| The state law tells us that we have to make an arrest on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| That is not our primary function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| That is not my primary function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Most of the time when we arrive on scene, my first statement is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| you haven't done anything wrong and you're not in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| But I just want to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| And then I think what's unique about our program is that we do follow-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| In some other programs that we looked into across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| this is not part of their protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| We try to stay within a 72-hour time frame for that initial follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| And what that will do is help us with our goals of really we would love to do more face-to-face follow-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| Right now with our call volume and our limited capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| we aren't able to do as much of that as we would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| I think that face-to-face really helps to build rapport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| and builds that trust between the person who experienced the crisis and our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| mainly with Lily and also with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| because sometimes I might be the one that they connect with, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| We want to discuss the progress that they've made since we made initial priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and set goals for them, which may be, you know, we need to make contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| We're going to help you make contact with your therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| We're going to help you get in touch with the hospital for new medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| if those aren't working for you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| and just kind of see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| And it's also good to address those people when they're not in a crisis phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| because sometimes when people are in crisis, they don't hear everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| They don't remember everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| And so it's good to follow up and have that extra little bit of service provision that we can give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| to help make sure that they're understanding what we need them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| or what they need to do to hopefully help them the best way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| This is not always possible for us to make contact with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| People don't always have phone numbers so that we can get back in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| Some people are homeless, and we don't have residences to find them at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| So sometimes it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| But in those cases, we will make contact with either their case manager that we've tried to set them up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| or that they've already had set up, the admissions facility that we take them to or they're admitted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| And if that's not the case, sometimes we will talk to family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| We will continue to try to get in touch with the actual individual that experienced the crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| and reach out to them if they want to continue speaking with us about services that we have and can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| And like I said, the benefit of this is just an ongoing communication connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| We have people that we've dealt with that have gotten into services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| that are now calling us just to say thank you, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| What are our objectives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| We want to improve response to those co-response type calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| We want to increase the number of calls that we can get to by increasing the number of teams that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| Another big portion of this is that we do our own transports most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| If AMR comes and transports for us, AMR can send a bill out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| They are a private company, and they do bill these clients for that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| We provide that service as a free charge, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| I don't ask for money to take you to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| And we take a lot of people wherever we need to get them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| And it's also good because they have built that rapport with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| that we don't have to transport them over to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| That's another new experience that they have to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| We want to expand the response to the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| I think I've already said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| We want to increase coverage during those peak call hours, which I kind of mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Right now we're seeing, and I kind of based this off of some of the data work that I've already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| through the October to December time frame, which shows that a majority of our calls for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| that we would most likely respond to are happening between the hours of 12 p.m. and 11 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Right now, obviously, we're stopping at 6 p.m. because I do have a family at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| and I have to go home at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| And so adding these other teams would allow us to hit that extra six hours or five hours of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| that we're not currently covering and not able to help community members with the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| We want to reduce the time that patrol is on these type calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Our call average right now, and I'm going to get into it a little longer, is a little over an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| And that's a long time for a patrol officer not to be answering other calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| And so what our main function is when we get there, we assess, we make sure the scene is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| and I'm getting those other officers back in the field so they can answer other calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| And that would help us out if we had more teams as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Increase that post-call follow-up to support improved outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| Obviously, if we have more people, we can have more face-to-face contact, build more rapport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| and build better trust with the people we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| I'm going to kind of skim through this because this is what we've already seen in the impact statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| I didn't want to add any new data to you because I want to keep the numbers where we've already seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| We've obviously had calls this month that are not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But after we showed you what we had last time, what we're finding is that the breakdown of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| we're dealing with on our calls for service match pretty close to what our makeup is in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| as far as the racial breakdown, mostly white, mostly 35 to 44, mostly male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| Why this is highlighted, I think, is a big issue for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| is that we're trying to reduce the number of people that are calling in multiple times to 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| and calling in on an emergency line repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| We're finding that we can go out and set that connection up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| and then they can call us directly if they need something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| and that we can hopefully help them out without having to tie up an officer on a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| that the police may not be able to do much with because it's not a crime a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| for what these multiple calls are calling in about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| or it may not be something that we have the ability to do really anything on the law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| So Lilly can help set up services for them and address some of those needs outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| As you saw in our impact statement, we had 199 calls to date from October 1st to May 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| Our average call time was 62 minutes in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| We've had calls as short as 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| We've had calls as long as seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| So 62 being the average is a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| But the difference, I think, is that we are able to devote that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and we're not worried about having to get out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| We are there for them at that moment, and that's what we're trying to really make that a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| is that they are the reason we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| We want to make sure we're helping them the best way possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| and we'll give it as much time as we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| Thirty-six percent, which is the majority of the calls we're getting, are suicidal ideations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| These range from someone that's just not feeling well today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| and is thinking about hurting themselves or just doesn't want to wake up tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| to two calls in a row that we had, you know, individuals that are pointing guns to their heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| So there's a vast difference between just saying suicidal ideations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| It could range tremendously in the amount of severity or danger that's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| We can respond to every single one of those calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| which may be something that we can't do in another type of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| General investigations are just things that really don't fit into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| I was told I needed to probably clarify that for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| It's a general investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Maybe something's just not right that can't be really put into another category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| So we get a lot of just, can you go check on something for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| When we talk about dispositions, almost half of our calls, about 45 percent, we are going to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| And I want to speak on this just a little bit because I think it's kind of confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| that we're not using the CSU as much as we'd like to, the Crisis Stabilization Unit, or the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| The BHUC, you have to have a charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| And like I said, our primary goal is not to arrest anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| So we're not putting charges on people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| so we aren't ones that are going to be utilizing our high utilizers of the BHUC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| The Crisis Stabilization Unit, as I also said, was a voluntary admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| It's for people that want to get help, are seeking help, and ask us to take them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| And we offer that as a service, and we'll be glad to take them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| As long as there's beds available, we'll be getting them in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| But that's not always the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| We also have people that are not wanting to get help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| They may not think that there's anything wrong at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| And for that reason, we have to take them into the ER to get them stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| We have to get them into the ER based off the acuity of their level of psychosis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| or delusions or whatever is going on at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| We're dealing with calls that are coming into 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| because this is something that they're not going to seek this help on their own, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| And so that's something that we have to focus on a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| But the other side of that is that I want you to look over at the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| which is referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| We're almost doing the same amount of times telling people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| giving them options to seek treatment outside of any other service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and leaving them in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| We are telling them, here's some resources for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Here's some treatment options for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| Here's who you can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| We can check up on you in a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| And we can just do a referral basis and leave you at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| So we're not taking everybody in, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| and we would much prefer to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Eighty-four percent of the individuals we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| we're having one encounter with them, which is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| That just means that we're hopefully satisfying whatever need that they had at that one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| and we're not having to go back out and have a repeat encounter with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| Thirty-two percent right now are receiving a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| or follow-up face-to-face within that 72-hour window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| I'll say we're doing really well at the 72 hours if you look at business days right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| but we are lacking in the amount of people that we need to adequately hit that 72-hour window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| that we would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Again, I reiterate this because we need more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| and I think that that's what we're really striving for here in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| I think it's a program that we've shown in being involved with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| that I think we are helping people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| I think we are really getting them to where they need to be, which is not jail most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| It's also getting people the help that they need quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and so they're able to access those items and those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| without having to jump through hoops and call around and try to find something for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| It's very quick. It's very easy to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| But we could do more of it with more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I want to touch on our missed calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| because this is another reason I feel like we do need some more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| Our challenge right now, we're missing about six calls on average per week during our shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| That's not saying that we have six calls we're missing on Saturdays and Sundays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| and the evenings when we get off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| That's six calls while we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| We had several calls the other day while we were on other calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| We're getting other calls from other officers saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| hey, I've got one that I think you could help out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Can you see us over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| I'm sorry, we can't. We're in the middle of another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Like I said, we're going to be devoted to that one call that we're on because we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| But the ability to have another unit out there with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| would hopefully limit this to a very minimal number that we're missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| Our capacity, we want to do more of those face-to-faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| and also increase our time outside of 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| It will provide those additional opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| It will decrease that patrol response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I feel like we're going to have less involvement with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| because they're going to see the same team over and over again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| if they're calling for a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| You're going to get four units that are going to be answering these type of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I think it's going to lessen the amount of time you're talking to law enforcement as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| because you're only dealing with these four units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| if we're able to get to almost all of the mental health calls that we're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| And it allows for some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| I serve on our SWAT team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| I serve on the CIT board, so I'm teaching sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2046)|
| 0:34:11| We have to travel. We have vacations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| When I'm not there, we're not doing what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| If we have more teams, we would be able to increase that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| I'm going to turn it back over to Candice for a compassionate response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I wanted to kind of talk about this as a compassionate response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| because the bottom line is why are we all doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| We're doing it because there's a lot of people out there that are suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| that have untreated mental illnesses, significant mental illnesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| that have perhaps been off their medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| they've got other things going on, they're homeless, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And that's why we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| And I think that we're doing it in a very compassionate and caring way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| because we're partnering it with someone who has the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| of the mental health and addictions skills that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| and then also with a CIT officer that also is the partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| and not all officers need to be CIT officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| It's a skill set and it's someone that's already geared towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| trying to help individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| So I wanted to give also just a short scenario, an example of a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| so that you all can kind of get a sense of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| So 911 call from a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| He's called in because there is a lady that's screaming and yelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| and walking up and down his sidewalk in front of his establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| People are starting to gather around and some of them aren't being too nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| She's starting in and out of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| She's getting off the sidewalk and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| So when Lily and Sergeant Clinton arrive on that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Sergeant Clinton immediately goes into that safety environment skill set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| that he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| He's got the authority to keep her out of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| and stop traffic if he needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| Lily, at that point, also is able to concentrate on the person who's so struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| And so it took, at that point, Lily I think about 20 minutes of just walking with her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| up and down, her screaming and yelling, paranoid visual hallucinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| to finally connect and to be able to trust and to build a rapport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| And that's still going on as well with Sergeant Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| After about 20 or 30 minutes, they were able to talk with her again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| get some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| This whole call took an hour and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| but she was able to get into the car with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| and they took her over to the crisis stabilization unit where they did an intake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| She was still so scared that she asked if they could stay with her during the intake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| which they were able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| She successfully got admitted into the crisis stabilization unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| and since that time has really been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Got back on her medications, got back to her provider, and is doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| This is a service that, you know, we have a lot of great services in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| but no other agency, and we've got a lot of services in our own, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| at McNabb could have handled that kind of call that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| And so I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| So the need is so, you know, that immediate need to help people as a first responder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| is just invaluable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I'm Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| My role today is to talk a little bit about alternative models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| And if you'll go on to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| We thought this graph did a great job of depicting four general categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2279)|
| 0:38:06| of where behavioral health crisis models can fall into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And these are just examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| It's not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| There's a community crisis response, police-based response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| co-responder response, and community alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| If you look at the community crisis response model, those are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| for the examples I've given, mobile crisis units, crisis call centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| the crisis stabilization unit, and even certified peer specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| embedded in emergency departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| Knoxville is really actually fortunate to have a lot of these service levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| within our own city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| So they expand to serve the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| and they are really designed across the entire state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| So we do have a nice, I think, framework in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| There's still certainly gaps in that, but it's a pretty good framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| The next category is police-based responses, and that's, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| just like it sounds, any response that is only police-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| And the best example of that, of course, is what we've been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| is the crisis intervention team model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| So that's, of course, where officers are given skills and tools to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| if presented with someone experiencing symptoms of a mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| or substance use disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| It's very intensive, 40 hours, and like Candice said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| hundreds of officers have been trained, and we've been doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| What I'd like to focus on tonight is to narrow down a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| in the bottom two categories, the co-responder category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| and the community alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| So when we were awarded this pilot early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| we knew that there was a few things we wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| We wanted to reach out to some other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| and learn how they rolled out a co-response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2408)|
| 0:40:14| If there's something we could learn from someone else's mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| we certainly wanted to skip that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| So we identified, and this was a group from McNab and KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| we identified three cities that we wanted to reach out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| and we selected those cities specifically because we wanted to look at cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| that had also an alternative response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| So Denver, Colorado was one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| They have had a co-responder program for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| and have more recently added the alternative response star program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| We also selected Eugene, Oregon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I think, as you probably know, they have the most well-known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| alternative response program called CAHOOTS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| and so we identified them as a city we wanted to reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| with the Whitebird Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| And then we selected Houston, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| They were getting a lot of good, positive comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| about their co-responder program, and so we selected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| So after these consults, I think that what we were able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| is to take away a very practical, working understanding of these two models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2486)|
| 0:41:35| The other thing we took away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| and I'd sort of like to propose this for the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| is that not to look at these models in comparison to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| What we learned from our consults were these models can operate independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| or they can very successfully operate in conjunction with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And I think when you're looking at two side-by-side, it's easy to compare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| but I don't think it's either-or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| I think it could be and or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| So I think that's important to kind of keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| But I want to walk through each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| and talk a little bit about what we thought were some of the biggest differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| The other thing I would say before we get started is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| there are a variety of different co-response models under co-response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| and there's a lot of variety in alternative response models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| So I'm really talking about the cities that we talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| but there are nuances to all of those programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| that cities develop based on their own unique needs and gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| in their services that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| So when you look at the first thing that I think everyone knows that stands out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| is really the difference in staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| So the co-response model is the model that's going to pair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| the master's level clinician with the CIT law enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| The alternative response model utilizes a peer specialist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| or a bachelor's level clinician and a licensed EMT or paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| I think the things to consider when you're looking at those two models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| when you're looking at needs in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| is what can be performed at that community level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| So the difference would be, you know, master's level clinicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| might be able to do more diagnostics at that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| where your bachelor's level clinicians are uniquely trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| in linkage and referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Master's level clinicians can do the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| but they're just a little bit different in their training and education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| And then, of course, the licensed EMT and paramedic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| is a very unique component, and they can do a lot of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| in the community minor medical things if a call requires that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| which is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| Another pretty significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| well, I might even say this is another very significant difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| is the 911 call system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| So the reason I think our team early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| and this was back when Candice was talking about the SIMS model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| they were moving toward developing a co-responder model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| because it was the next step to have someone intervene in that intercept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| It was easy to roll out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| There's not any requirement to change your 911 call system in your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Calls come in, that team can go out, and that team can go out on any call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| So the triage is not that critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| In an alternative response model, that call triage is vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| So when we talked to the alternative response models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| they spent a great amount of time in training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| well, actually identifying and then training how calls are going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| so that they can make sure that the call is dispatched appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| And that took a significant amount of time, and that's a very critical part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| I think what we also saw in some of the alternative response models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| is they might even change their entire call system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Some calls could come in and individuals in the community could press a button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| to get straight to their alternative model directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| Some were also receiving referrals from an entirely different route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2725)|
| 0:45:33| What we did see is that the dispatch was still coordinating those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| in these two models that we looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| that they made sure that the law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and the alternative response team may not go out together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| but they're working together in case they're needing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| or backup or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| So I think that's important, so that law enforcement can call out an alternative call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| or alternative call of response team can call for law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| I think that the triage was so important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| because we want to make sure that the person who needs help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| gets the right level of response, and that really gets to the third bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| Your co-response teams can go out to any 911 call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| because of that law enforcement portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| In an alternative response model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| it's important that the triage assures that the individual is in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| that's nonviolent, like Sergeant Clinton said, noncriminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| and then no known threat to not only the caller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| but anyone around in the home or the community or in the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| and then that it's not a threat to the responders who are responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| And a good, thorough triage at the call level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| can really weed that out if it's done really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| And then I think another part that we learned is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| that also required a lot of community awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| What now becomes how are individuals accessing 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| and how does the community need to access 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| and for what service can they access 911 for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| So I think in the communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| the one in Eugene, Cahoots, has been around for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| In Denver, they took a lot of time working with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| to develop and get community involvement and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| as far as where are we going to go with utilizing this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| and get buy-in and input around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| So I think that was the other thing we learned from our consults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| In closing, I think if I would just talk about lessons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| what we learned from these models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Both models can meet, are very similar in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2878)|
| 0:48:04| but they're also very different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| and they can both meet community needs and gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| What we found are communities are identifying their own needs and gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| and to figure out which model works best for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| it may be one, it may be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| So that's what we had seen with those calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| And so every model needs to be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| within the context of the young community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| they're looking to place in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| We also learned, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| that they can operate independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| or in conjunction with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| And it really builds out more of a continuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| when you think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| so you're able to serve more individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| if you've got a broader service array| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| and can meet people on a continuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| In closing, I just think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| regardless of which model communities utilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| law enforcement officers are going to be presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| with individuals in our community that are experiencing symptoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| of mental illness and substance use disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| And the more we can provide them with training, such as CIT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| to give them the skills to be able to just have different options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| and different responses than they may have had before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| is vital for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| And I think the other thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2970)|
| 0:49:36| the more we can embed mental health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| at any intercept point that an individual can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| into the criminal justice system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| and that includes when they're presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| in the community by law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| the better we can divert decriminalized mental illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| and get people help with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| So we're at the end of the meat of our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| I will close, really, with just a few kind of quick remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| that kind of give an indication of where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| as the administration and with our partners in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| might look to head next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| So the first, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| we have approved in our fiscal year 22 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| the expansion of the co-response model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| to achieve the goals that we've outlined here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| That RFP will be issued this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| and we would expect to bring council back a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| for that expanded program probably late summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| so we're looking at August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| such that there is no lapse in services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| for the community on this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| The other really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| very important opportunity that we would face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| in understanding more about these systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| is with the team from McNab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| understanding the criticality of that sequential intercept mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| and the collaborative community partner discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| that happened back in 2015| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| that allowed that identification of gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| as well as an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| of how resources in our community fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| That was such an important step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| and that is something that McNab has recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| and that we would agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| that we would complete a new SIMS model exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| that would, again, bring together those partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| within the community to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| how the landscape has changed in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| since that last 2015 mapping process took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| We have new resources that did not exist back in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| and I think that that's going to be a very important step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| in understanding the landscape of other potential needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| and opportunities and gaps that we can fill together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| and how those systems would fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| because I think, as Ms. Hilliard mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| the success of these programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| really relies on the systemic and institutional supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| that make them possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| for example, that triage at the E911 level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and so we would need to be very intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| about how we begin that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| and continue that discussion, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| of how those pieces fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| And, of course, all of that lends itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| to a continued evaluation of how we as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| and I will say not just as the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| but with our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| including Knox County and the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| and others in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| who are really engaged every day on the mental health response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| not just from a law enforcement perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| but from a medical perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| and from all of these systems that fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| So we will, of course, continue to engage in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| and I think that those are important partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| who would need to be part of a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| around such a model beyond co-response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| that would look to be more of that community-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| alternative response program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| So that's what we have for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| We are happy to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| and would love as much question and discussion as you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| for us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| Yes, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Under the current structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| the shift is just from 8 to 6 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| and under the proposal to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| would that time frame be expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| So if we were able to expand to the four teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| we're looking at having two teams on a day shift schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| It might be moved from the 8 to 6 to a 7 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| which follows our current day shift schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| and then the second two units would be on the afternoon schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| which would run out until 11 o'clock, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| So not quite around the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Not quite around the clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| We're going to need more teams than four at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| But that would give us seven days of coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| so we would be working on the rotation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| that gives us Monday through Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you all for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| and your commitment to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Where applicable, is Knox HMIS updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| when services are rendered to individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| that are applicable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| As of right now, it's not going into the HMIS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| unless we are sending a referral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| through one of those service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| that are involved with HMIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| If we have a homeless person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| if we get them in with a volunteer ministry center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| that would obviously go through their system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| and get into the HMIS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| But I don't have access to enter that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| So the co-responder team is not utilizing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| but the agencies where folks may end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| are inputting information as they usually do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| If it's a homeless person, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| And then who is doing the 72-hour follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| So that is, literally most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| is doing a majority of those phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| We do those together at times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| or we're going out face-to-face and talking to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| and doing a follow-up in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| which, like I said, I would really like to increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I think that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| With some of the ones we've been able to really make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| a good connection with doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| one of which we actually wanted to check on today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| but we had another call come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| so we weren't able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| But, yeah, that's what we'd like to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I just have a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| Talk about the triage through 911,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| where these calls come now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| In your assessment of other cities and other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| I imagine whoever takes that call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| in the system-wide response, there's a learning curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| for which calls require the co-responder team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| And I'll actually address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| because we're still having some speed bumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| in just getting calls for our team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| much less triaging to another alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| I think it will improve when we have teams on two shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| because our dispatchers also rotate through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| So knowing when we're working and where we're available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| what I would like to see is them to send me any call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| that sounds like it's a mental health call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| and then I can dispatch it out from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| as far as whether or not we need to be making a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| or if it's something that patrol could handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| or something that would not necessarily need us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| It's not happening as much as I would like for it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| but I think that's just something that getting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| it will improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| I think having those teams always available seven days a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| and on two shifts should improve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| that they'll know that at least somebody is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| for the first two shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| It's just a timing thing right now, and it's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| I mean, we all get into habits of the dispatchers that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| have been there for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| so they're used to dispatching calls out as soon as they come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| to whoever's available on that beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| So it's a learning curve that we're still working out the kinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| And we also addressed that at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| and went and had a meeting with 9-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| and talked with them at dispatch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| and so telling them about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| And so we did and met with them and met some of the dispatchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| And for the models that were specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| community alternative responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| can you talk about the triaging they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| and what criteria they used for where those folks can go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| So I know when we talked to Denver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| Denver actually sent their dispatch unit supervisors to Eugene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| to learn about the whole entire triage process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| And I don't remember all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| but they have an entire manual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| to identify the type of clinical situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| If you looked at it, you would think it's a clinical triage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| So it would look like what are the clinical presentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| the person is demonstrating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| whether that's the caller themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| or someone calling on that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| And then there is a flow sheet of questions and answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| that get to the clinical presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| to determine do we need to call some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| First of all, is it safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| They want to make sure that there's no...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| They rule that out quite quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| and then they rule into is it appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| to send the alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Once that happens, then they're still monitoring that call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| to see if they need to change that at any point during the call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| if they send an alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| and then need to call the police in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| or if the police are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| and they need to have the alternative team join.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| It's pretty complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| We're going through a similar learning curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and triaging, adjusting, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| What I would say is it's more complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| That's the difference because right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| they're determining whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| to send a master's level clinician along with the officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| In this alternative scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| they're having to make the decision not to send an officer at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| It's a more in-depth clinical process that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| I don't think it's so much as a triage as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| is this a mental health call that we can identify immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| that this is mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Someone's calling in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| I'm thinking about killing myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| That's a mental health call that we should get that dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| It's where it boils down and we say someone's acting erratically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Are they intoxicated or is it a mental health crisis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| What's causing the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| They dispatch a regular patrol officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| to a person stumbling in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| Then they get on scene and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| hey, this is a mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| It's 190 work and send them over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Then we'll respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| I think the other part of the triage and the setting up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and we talked about the additional phone lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| is that the program in Eugene has been around for so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| that people are identifying that in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| and have an idea that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| this is someone I could call this other number for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| And they have an additional line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| But you have a big community buy-in in that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| because all of those services that represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| and work with that program are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and have been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Those are things that we would have to work towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| putting into place that we may not already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| or are already being supplemented by some of the services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| that already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| We already have a mobile crisis that can handle a crisis call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| They don't have that set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| They have a different function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I think the whole gist of this is there are times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| when we go on calls and I'll look at Lilly and I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| this could have been an alternative response call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| They could have handled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| I don't think we're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| I'm not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| I think there's a lot of things that could be done and done well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| especially with transportation and getting people to places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| especially with meetings with therapy or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| where we're having to utilize ETHRA and other functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| that we have right now to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| I don't think any of us are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| I feel like it's something that we could work very well hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| It's just a matter of getting it to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| where that actually needs to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| or it's not functioning in what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3644)|
| 1:00:47| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| Given the work that you do every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| we don't have a substantial mental health facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| So I ask you just a broad question of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| can you talk about the effect of that on your daily experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| and your daily work in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Yeah, I think we have good resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| A lot of the individuals we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| are ones that are struggling to maintain outpatient care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| They're struggling to continuously keep their medication levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| where they're supposed to be or should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| or they're not calling in when something's not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| as well as it used to because things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| It's a chemical imbalance in your brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| It's something that sometimes alters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| and you have to change things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| and finding that cocktail that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| doesn't always happen on the first try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| So I think we're good on some of our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Now, do I feel like there are times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| where we have people that need more extensive services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| that I would love to get them to somewhere local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| instead of having to send them down to Moxon Bend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| to get down near Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| or over to another location that has a facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| I think we all would agree that would be fantastic to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| and it would divert a lot of the calls that are going to the ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| away from the ER because that's what they're dealing with over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| is just getting them medically cleared to send them to Moxon Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| where we're having to put people in hallways right now in an ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| for 3 or 4 days waiting for a bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| I think that's ridiculous. I think that's incompassionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I think it's just not what we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| and I don't think anybody in this room wants to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| Unfortunately, that's reality we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| and what we're living with right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and so it's frustrating on our part to see someone come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| that needs serious mental health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| and goes somewhere for 3 days and is out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| because they think they're stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| because they're no longer in that crisis situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| but they need long-term, constant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| or very long-term assistance with staying in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| and that's not something that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| I don't think that's something a lot of the country has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| so I don't think it's a here problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| I think it's just a nationwide mental health problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| that's going on right now. Would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Councilman Roberto, whose light is not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| and then Councilwoman Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Councilman Thomas, do you have additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| Okay, we'll go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Okay, we'll go in that order. Roberto, Testament, Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| First, I wanted to say thank you to all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| for coming today, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| and also thank you for the service you're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| here in our community. It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| My first question was about the response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So after a call is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| how long does it take to respond to that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Usually, it kind of depends on where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| Obviously, we cover the entire city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| so if we're on one end of the city on another call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| and we have to go to Starl Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| it's going to take us a little bit of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| especially with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Usually on average, we're talking 15 to 20 minutes max| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| that we're looking at getting somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| if we're somewhere near the center of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| to get somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I'm still digging through reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| from the data set that I asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| which is about 2,000 pages' worth of narratives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| that I'm trying to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| and narrow down kind of location-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| where we're seeing most of our calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| so we can kind of direct those new units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| to be in that area more than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| But that's a data set that I'm going to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| for a little bit trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| But I would say no more than 15 to 20 minutes on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| But you also have to understand that another officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| if they're dispatched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| will get there probably sooner than we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| if they're on the beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| So the initial actual contact may come faster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| than us getting there on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| And that was my follow-up to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| was how does that compare to a non-corresponder response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| Like is there average response time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| that we're looking at for those calls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| And are we responding to these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| with the co-response team faster or about average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Are you talking about like a mobile crisis response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| Like a community response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Or are you talking like another officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Just another officer response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| I'd say five to ten minutes at the max on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| You know, we're not the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| We don't run lights and sirens to every call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| So we follow traffic laws and get there when we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| You know, that's our preferred and normal response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| would be just normal traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| So we're not running emergency traffic to every call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| I'd say no more than five to ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| If you have more teams, then do you think you can drive down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| It should hopefully lessen the amount of time it takes us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| to get there as a co-response team, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And then you had mentioned that I think in the slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| 16% of those that you've served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| have had more than one encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| So what I was wondering is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| is there a missing piece that you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| that would allow to not have the need for that next encounter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3943)|
| 1:05:49| I think when you look at those multiple encounters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| these are encounters that have been multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| for quite some time anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| These are our repeat callers that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| generally going to get multiple calls on anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| What we're looking for on our end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| is that that number is decreasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| or the time is lengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| between their multiple call scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| So if we have someone that calls in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| you have to understand when we arrive on scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| there are going to be times that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| an ability to really do a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| because they haven't committed a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| they're not a danger to themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| they're not a danger to other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and so they're going to be staying at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| And so all we can do is set up those referrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| or those goals and things that we hope that they'll do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| but we can't force anybody to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| So we're going to be dealing with some of those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| We get dispatched to people that are dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| with dementia problems and Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Those are things we can't fix, through medication even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| We're not going to fix that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| So we have a female that might be calling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| eight to ten times a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| and then after we've spoken to them and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| hey, listen, we can help you out if you'll contact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| what I'm saying is multiple calls into 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| We may be dealing with this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| but we're taking it off of the 911 service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| and the dispatch to regular patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| that's repeatedly going out to this house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| to the point that we're not able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| and we're still saying we can't do anything for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| At least we can work on the other side to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| can adult protective services, can nursing home help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| can something else be a service for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| where Lily has, you know, a book this big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| that officers don't have, and we can go through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| and we can work through kinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| and try to find some other way of helping this person out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| So a lot of that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| One of the things you had said earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| was about individuals who are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| with maintaining their kind of outpatient treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Is that, you know, one of the pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| that I was trying to identify in that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| that might be a missing piece overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| not necessarily in this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| but just overall that type of issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| And if all of you could comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Yeah, I think that's a lot of what we deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| because you have to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| when people are getting diagnosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| with a behavioral health diagnosis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| let's say it's schizophrenia or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| they may get a medication set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| The medication may make them feel like a zombie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| It may not do anything for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| They may increase the voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| It may do a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| because you and I are not the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| so the way it affects my body is not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| And so it sometimes takes multiple chances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| and that means we're having multiple encounters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| that we're going to a therapist or a doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| that's having to prescribe those medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| to get that cocktail, as we will call it, correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| before it doesn't feel too awkward for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| They feel normal, if you will, whatever normal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| They feel like they're able to make rational choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| and they understand what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| and they're able to take that medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| because it doesn't make them feel like dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| That may be something, trial and error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| that has to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| I would just add that it's important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| that a lot of the individuals that we're responding to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| have multiple challenges and barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| And when transportation sometimes can be a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| or we're talking about individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| who might need to prioritize basic needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| then getting to their doctor's appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| sometimes is not always the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| And so we want to make sure that for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| who are in need of that service and level of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| that we hook them up with additional community supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| But sometimes that takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| And we're also talking about, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| sometimes a difficult-to-engage population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| So we want to make sure that we have clinicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| that are trauma-informed and engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| and doing what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| to try to have a mental health home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| for that person to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| so they're not reaching out to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| And then last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| When you receive...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| I know that it seemed like 911 calls and referrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| were almost equal in one of the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| When you receive a 911 call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| can somebody request the co-response team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| Is there an option for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Or is this going to be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| where you're going to make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| and send that team out when appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| I think you're representing the ER versus the referrals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| which was pretty equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| As far as a response, we will get calls for CIT officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| If someone's dealt with us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| they may contact us to come and want to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| We had Mobile Crisis call us today to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| hey, we've got somebody that you all need to speak with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| and we're requesting you specifically to go out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| But in general, it's not going to happen that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| unless they know about a CIT program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| or whatever training that some officers have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| They may request something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Unless it's a service provider that's worked with me specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| that knows me and calls me on my phone and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| hey, can you come talk to somebody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| It's probably not going to be that direct at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| I think the more this is increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| and we get the name out there that we're here and we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| we've received a lot of positive comments in the community when we're on calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| that we didn't know you all did this, this is amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| we're really happy that you're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| this is a different way of looking at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| That's word of mouth, and word of mouth goes a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| So I'm hoping that that does start to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| that people are saying, hey, my son's got schizophrenia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| can you send a co-response team out here to talk to him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| That would be fantastic for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| So, yeah, I see that coming, but I think it's down the road at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Council Member Testa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Great presentation and well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Kind of piggybacking on what Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| a couple of his questions, and you all have touched on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Going back to the 199 calls over those seven months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| how many percentage or just a guesstimate on, would you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| classify as non-violent, non-criminal, no threat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4324)|
| 1:12:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| I'd have to look back on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| and I could probably get you a number that represents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| We've dealt with several that I feel like we were a must-have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| that if I wasn't there or if we weren't involved with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| as a co-response, that it would not be a typical response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| by an alternative model like CAHOOTS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| There are calls that we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| We literally did one two days ago that was a transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| We needed to get this lady somewhere just because she didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| We were trying to keep her off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| and we couldn't get her in the car and we couldn't get her in the VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| We were trying to get her somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| and we located a hotel that we were able to get her into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| That would have been a good opportunity for an alternative model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| to come in and say, hey, you just need transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| you need some food, versus Lily and I doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| because that's just me giving a ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| I don't know if I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I don't want to give you a percentage because I don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| Obviously a lot are suicide, which obviously involves weapons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| I think it's almost an oversimplification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| because I think we have those calls that we say in law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| that no call is a routine call because it can always turn to something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| That's not to say that we expect that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| I don't think just because it's a behavioral health call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| that it's going to be a violent behavioral health call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| We have a lot of very calm people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| and I think that's part because of how we talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| and how we come into the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| We're not coming in as I'm here because you're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| It's an immediate statement that, listen, you're not in any trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| We're just here to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| This is my partner, and I'd like for her to have some words with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| You can talk to me because I've been trained in de-escalation through CIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| Sometimes I build a rapport with that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| and Lily does a good job of taking notes and starting to make phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| So it's not one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| I think we work together as a team very well in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| I hate to say that it's just, well, this is definitely a call for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| It may or may not be, and there's a lot of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| even if you look through some of the things that we looked at with that model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| they're calling the police because they needed them again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| and now we're not there, whereas in this model we are already there on scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| so we can kind of take control if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Obviously that's not my primary function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| I think that's the main thing is that that's not what I'm there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| I think the notion that this seeing the police on scene at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4478)|
| 1:14:46| is an automatic increase to the level of anxiety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| and it's going to cause people to be more violent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| I don't think that that's the case because I haven't seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| We've had zero uses of force to date out of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| So I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4501)|
| 1:15:03| I don't think it has to be an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| I think there's definitely places where alternative response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| would be outstanding to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| but I don't think we're doing a bad job at doing their job right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| No, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| I'm not insinuating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| And just also kind of talking about resources a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| talking about the gaps in resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| We obviously know there need more teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| We need more addiction treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| We need more mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| What other gaps are you seeing that we might not see or be thinking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| I think right now the amount of turnover that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| is because we have so many people that are needing additional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| and so they're having to open up beds at Moccasin Bend quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| than we probably used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Would you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| I feel like that's part of it, that their bed turnover has to stay in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| so they're trying to get people in and out the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| so that's why you're not seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| You know, I think the gaps we're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| we're seeing longer waits for access to inpatient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| and Sergeant Clinton is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| That's across the country, but we're seeing it here too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| I think what I would also say is this unique population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| we're seeing a gap in intensive community-based services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| So for this population, I think a need would be intensive case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4578)|
| 1:16:27| in the home, in the community, mobile, going to them, wrapping around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| That can be expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| and I think that's where we've seen probably a huge need is what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| especially for the uninsured population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| I had a question about how they possibly do it in Eugene, if you happen to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4612)|
| 1:16:59| They have an alternative response system, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| What happens if it doesn't meet the criteria of being non-violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| So they will still call Eugene PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| I think the name in and of itself is what it's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| They're in cahoots with the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| because the police still have to be involved in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| What we're seeing is, and I'm not sure exactly which numbers CAHOOTS was putting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| is about 5% to 7% of the calls that they were able to take away from the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| is what the police were representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| That could be a myriad of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| They do a lot of transports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| They're doing a lot of things like that that are able to be diverted from police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| But as far as what they're doing up there, that's all they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| They're just having to call the police if it has to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| When they call the police, do the police join the alternative response team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| or is it another team that comes out that's a co-response team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| I don't think they have a co-response team up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| So it would be just the police coming out as kind of a call out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| to help the responders, the alternative community response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| And then they would hand off to CAHOOTS if they felt that was the most appropriate response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| So the difference, I guess, or one of the differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| is that the alternative response team initially, if they think it fits the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| they send someone out without the police, but then they call the police in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| If need be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| The model here, the co-response, the policeman goes out with the mental health person in front of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Also, one clarification, CAHOOTS responds to 20% of the police calls, and you do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| Not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Councilwoman Parker, I can't quite hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| CAHOOTS responds to 20% of the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| That was a question, just to clarify, not the 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| I will clarify, Ms. Parker, that was from the Eugene PD side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| That was not from the CAHOOTS side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| That was their numbers that they were representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| It was between 5% and 7% were being diverted from the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| based off what the police were seeing by CAHOOTS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| It's all public information that's been extensively reported on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| There's two people giving alternate percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Councilmember Fugate and then Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| We've heard a lot, and I have people ask a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| I think we could talk about this all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| I think if I understood you, Officer Clinton, and if I have your rank wrong, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Are you Sergeant Clinton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| I got called Lieutenant the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| I'll take whatever I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4796)|
| 1:19:57| Well, what are you really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| I'm Sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Sergeant, because I want to call you the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Sergeant Clinton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Sergeant Clinton, I think what I heard you say was that CAHOOTS may go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4803)|
| 1:20:10| and then call the police, so maybe some discrepancy in the tallying of the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| as CAHOOTS responds to 20% of the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| I'm just trying to get us out of either or, right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| It sounds to me like these things do not have to be mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| and the more people we have helping people, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| And this zero-sum game conversation of one is the right way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| and one is the wrong way to do it I think is missing the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| My conversation that I'd like to talk about is how long, if we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| a CAHOOTS model would work for us or something similar, alternative response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| because it is very expensive to send officers out all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| but when people call 911, that's what they expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| When I call 911, I expect a police officer to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| because if I call 911 as a citizen who is seeing something that concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4870)|
| 1:21:22| and I call 911 and I ask for the police, that's what I expect to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| At some point, how long would it take us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| Because you said these other cities, it takes a while to establish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Is this the purpose of this SIMS evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| and we might try to start that when Ms. Gildee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| I mean is that something that the city would lead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| And then I'm sorry because I'm rambling, but my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I suppose the county has these issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4912)|
| 1:21:57| And so does the county have CIT-trained sheriff's deputies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| We train the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Do they work with Helen Ross McNabb as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| So it sounds to me like this is not just a one government issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| or an entirely governmental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| This is a community issue and the government piece of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| is the law enforcement officers that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| and then the grant funding that we provide to service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Is that the general way this works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| I think that's a very astute systems level observation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| of how these systems have to fit together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| And again, I think it does go back into that systemic intercept model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| and I think that's why I'm going to let the McNabb team describe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| a little bit more, what they have advised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| because again that landscape has, it is integrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| I shouldn't say it has to be, it is integrated with these other providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| and so to look at it solely through a city lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| would miss a significant portion of the important conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| that are happening around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| And before you answer the question or explain this to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| who's the convener of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| How did that happen before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Can you describe the history for how it happened successfully in 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| In 2015 we had the ability to have people from the GAINS Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| that was the technical assistance through a grant that we had through SAMHSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| And did Helen Ross McNabb get the grant to bring them here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| It was part of the service that was available to us through the grant, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| So they came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| So you had a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| We had a grant and it was part of it because it was a pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| for the whole entire United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| There's only three pilot selections and we were one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| so they were able to go to all three of those and provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| And you're right, I think when you do a CIMS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| you've got all community members, county, city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| everyone involved on every side of it to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| It's really great because then you really know, you can really map out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| where your gaps are and what you do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| and it gives you a better view of the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| because we already have a lot of services in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| We really do, but we have some significant gaps as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| So that would help identify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5067)|
| 1:24:32| How many police teams are showing up when the co-responder team responds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| How many teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| It's not a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| It would be whoever was patrol would head out to the call first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| so that we'd get someone on scene hopefully pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| before we could get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| And then once we respond, if we determine that everything's good to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| I'll let them leave to try to reduce the number of officers on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5091)|
| 1:24:55| That's one thing that I was trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| because when you were describing that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| of allowing other officers to leave the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| I was trying to imagine how many were there initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Do you have a sense of the most officers you've seen respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| to an incident since you've been there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Well, it depends on what the call is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| I mean, we had a call the other day, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| with a woman with a gun to her head and children inside the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| So that's obviously going to dictate a different response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| than someone who is feeling like they don't want to wake up tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| You could see one officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| You could see four or five respond depending on what that call is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| I guess if that answers that question, I hope it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| It does help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| The reason I ask it is because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| similar to what Councilmember Fugate stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| in terms of our services that we provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| law enforcement is one of the most expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| And so I do think that we have to keep that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| when we are discussing this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| and considering alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| that not only might be better situated for the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| but would likely cost the city less to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| That was one point I wanted to lift up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| when we're thinking about the two different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| The other thing was there was a comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| between co-responder and alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| I would say almost an assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| that an alternative response team would solely rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| on a bachelor's level clinician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| I would say that's what CAHOOTS relies on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| but they've also been around 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| They've been able to build an impressive training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| And so they're able to bring folks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| pay them less with a bachelor's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| but provide their own training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| And so I imagine Knoxville would want to do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| so that we do have those master's level clinicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| I would argue that we need actual social workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| I don't believe that the graduate student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| is going to be able to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| These are not graduate students, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| They have completed their degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| they have graduated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| and they are fully licensed practicing clinicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Okay, thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| That's one reason why I wanted to be able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| the behavioral health specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| to understand what their abilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| Are they fresh out of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Is this their first professional experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| I think that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| So your first question about the comparisons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| between the two that listed the bachelor's level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| that just happened to be the models that we looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| But again, there are a wide variety of different models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| within alternative and with co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Some co-response teams have nurses, medics on that team too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| So it really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| I think they can be uniquely designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| And then with regard to the level of clinician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| in our program we've identified master's level clinicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| So they're individuals who have gone through graduate school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| and have obtained their master's degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| in a behavioral health field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| whether that be social work, marriage and family therapists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| some other field that's related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| I think the most important thing when you're looking at...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| I'm a social worker, so I'm going to say thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| So I think that the most important thing is to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| if the individual has really an excellent ability to engage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| a good understanding of crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| a willingness to work in a community setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| and willingness to work on a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Those are the things that when we're interviewing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| that we look for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| And Candice is the person who really does a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| of really making sure that we get the right fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| for each program that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Could I add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Yes, so when we were interviewing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| we interviewed 15 people for this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| that came back for three interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| And some of them as far away as California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| A guy came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| Each time that we interviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| we asked specific questions about what your experience was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| We would not put someone right out of graduate school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| into a position like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| So it was seasoned clinicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| and then we also had them meet with Sergeant Clinton as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| when he was identified as the person that was going to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| because you have to really get someone that can fit into a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| and that they have to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| If I had to be in a car with somebody eight or nine hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| I've got to get along with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| So we took a lot of care in selecting that individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| And I'll touch on your earlier statement before we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| She has zero issue telling me what she thinks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| Another model that I've been able to discuss with EMS folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5419)|
| 1:30:28| who I will say are super supportive of an alternative response team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| EMS is supportive of it because they see the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| to respond to these situations as healthcare needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| They see the need for additional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| to remove the pressures on emergency rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| You know, if we have the appropriate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| paired up on these outreach calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| even in the report that we've just seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| a lot of issues can be resolved in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| and not require transportation somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| And the model that they listed up, which was new to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| was simply a philosophy called mobile integrated healthcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| And the idea that you pair a mental health clinician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| with an EMS or nurse who is available for calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| throughout the community utilizing some sort of van| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5483)|
| 1:31:28| to allow their services to be mobile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| And I think that we're going to reach different conclusions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| depending on how we think about the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| that we're trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| And I believe each time we begin this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| it's kind of presented in a new way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| of what prompted us to want to look into this more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| Initially, last year, we were told it was in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| to the killing of Philly feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| And then we heard a presentation from Chief Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| about how services for the homeless community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| has become a major part of KPD's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5529)|
| 1:32:11| And so this is a part of that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| And now we're hearing about the sequential intercept model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| and how can we intercept folks with mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| and substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| through various points throughout the criminal justice journey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| And I would argue that the best way to intercept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| is to keep them out of the criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| And one thing that really stood out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| is when Sergeant Clinton stated that their goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5563)|
| 1:32:49| is to provide supportive services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| but if they arrive on scene and there is a crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| to respond to a warrant that has to be followed up on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| that becomes the first priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| over the mental health crisis that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Please correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Because what we're able to do is we can make contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| with our teams that are going to be in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| and we can already set up services for that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| while they're in jail through our diversion program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Even though the individual, for example, on the domestic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| by law we have to take someone to jail in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| It's a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| We shall arrest, okay, if we can determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| who the primary aggressor is in a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| So he had to go to jail, but we were able to make contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| to have services ready to go once he got into jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| that we could go ahead and start the behavioral health response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| to hopefully prevent this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| I'm just going to leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Does that kind of answer a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Yeah, I think another clarifying question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| to help me get a better picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| if you arrive and someone is in such a mental health crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| that they are flailing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| and there's concern that if you put them in the police vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| maybe they might hurt themselves as they're flailing around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| do you have a process for working to stabilize that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| before you would take them into custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| or would you take them into custody and stabilize them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| Yeah, I mean the hope is that we are able to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| to a point where they're not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| If we had to get someone that was that far removed from reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and they were a possibility of hurting themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| in the back of my car, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| it's got bars on it, it's got a plastic seat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| we will utilize ambulance services to help us out with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| so we're not putting them in that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| to where there's a real ability to hurt themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| We want them on a bed that we can help them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| medical services at that point if they needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Mostly it's just for that transport if that was the case though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| And there was another situation that you brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| dealing with public drunkenness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| and trying to determine how calls are triaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5709)|
| 1:35:15| and I think what I heard was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| police might be more likely to be called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| in a situation of public drunkenness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| and that wouldn't be considered a mental health issue or health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| No, I'm saying that that might be a call that we might receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| that's not readily clarifiable as a mental health call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| It's just someone stumbling into the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| or it could be someone is walking around aimlessly at the bus station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| It could be a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| that may not be clearly identifiable as a mental health call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| to a triaged person on a phone who's calling it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| and saying, hey, I've got somebody who's not acting right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| I don't know what's going on. They may be high on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| We get that call a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Well, that's not going to go through dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| as this is definitely mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| It's going to be sent out to a regular officer on the beat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| to say, hey, there's somebody not acting really right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| Can you go check it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| And so that was more pointing towards the triage side of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| about how even though if you set it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| and someone is trained to do triage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| a lot of times what we get on that call screen is not what we arrive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| because you're getting it third-hand through a complainant to a call taker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| The call taker has to write it down to the dispatcher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| who then has to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| We've all played the phone game in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| and it doesn't always get translated the same way on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| So I think that's kind of where I was going with that scenario or that example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| I hope that clarifies that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| So with some more training, we could get some clearer definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Because I would hope that the majority of those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| could be treated as potential mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| and that we start to see and treat substance abuse issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| It probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| The other portion of that is that we have to have somewhere to take those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| because they're not safe on the street if they're intoxicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| at the point they're stumbling in the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| So that would mean we'd have to have substance abuse places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| that we could put them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| which we don't have a lot of those services right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| where we can just take somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I think there's a lot of bigger questions and more complex answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| to a lot of the things we would love to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| I would love to sit down and talk at end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| about all the things that we need in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| to help all the people we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| That's going to cost an enormous amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| that we don't have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| What I think we have access to right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| is a program that is able to get help to someone very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| It's able to at least set them up in a way that we can get them quickly to services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| and set them up with services quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| And then if we have other options that are available to us down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| that are also equally as important as I think ours is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| like an alternative response that could respond to several calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| we are absolutely 100% back that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| I'm not against alternative response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| I think it's a fantastic program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| I think CAHOOTS is a fantastic program for what they're used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| I think there's still going to be time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| which even CAHOOTS and even other programs will have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| that the police have to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| There are medical calls that we go on because the medic unit will stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| because they don't feel safe going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| That's our call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| It's a medical call but they don't feel safe going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| so they're going to stage for the police to come and secure the scene, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| I think that's what we're there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| I think that's part of the concern is that even with trying to imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| a $400,000 program that doesn't involve police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| but has traditionally involved police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| we begin to hear concerns from police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| that they will no longer be called upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| which we as a society are nowhere close to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| So at no point in trying to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| that we should have this alternative program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| that responds to our health needs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| am I suggesting that it will solve all of our problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| and we will no longer need to call the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| I'm just talking about one program separate from police for services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| that I feel like we've been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| for the most part do not need police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| They may need to call them once they arrive on scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| but initially we could at least acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| that the majority of calls do not need police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| Now I've had conversations...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| I don't know that we can say it's a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| I can't also say that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| I can't say that it's not and I can't say that it is though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| Just based on your report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| if we are taking individuals to the ER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5972)|
| 1:39:38| we are leaving them without a police person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| They are being left at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| Not actually true because they have security on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| at the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| So we are leaving but their security is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Okay, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| The point that I wanted to make was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| I've had good conversations with the MS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| We are getting a new nurse dispatch line through 9-1-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| This is the time to be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| how to divert calls through 9-1-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| how to train our personnel to begin to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| triaging calls beyond just the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| that perhaps 9-1-1 has been accustomed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| I'm just concerned that everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| isn't perfectly laid out in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| We don't have all of the exact services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| that we need in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| But we have an extreme level of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| from multiple agencies in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| I talked to volunteer ministry centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| who want to be a part of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| They're in many ways waiting for the city to take the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| This can only work if the city takes the lead on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| They need to be brought together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| their work coordinated for these new services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| to be put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| And I honestly believe that we have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| to implement something that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| going back to my original arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| that I started to make around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| is that we've got to take some work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| off of the plate of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| We can't just keep putting everything on KPD's plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| We have an issue in society we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| an exact answer for, call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| Well, do they know how to respond to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| No, but they have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Nobody else has the authority, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| We can't keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| It's not a healthy way to manage issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| And I just want us to be brave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| and consider this alternative and not consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| not make it seem as if this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| that's years and years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| We can honestly pull this together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| and be able to provide the services to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| Perhaps an alternative response model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6126)|
| 1:42:10| needs to be a smaller pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I thought y'all were just downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| I didn't realize you were covering the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| That's tough, that hundred and whatnot square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| So, you know, perhaps we could start smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| focus on our population of unhoused folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| and have it just be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| in response to mental health and substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| so that we can truly begin to decriminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| those issues in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| and truly begin to respond in a public health manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| and not force our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| to turn it into a criminal justice matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| because their presence requires them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| That is what they are sworn to do as officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| Let's not even put them in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Let's put social workers in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| and they can stabilize those in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| not have to worry about whether there's a warrant out after them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| or any of those other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| but just worry about the health of that individual first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| and then we can deal with the rest later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| That's my hope for a program moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6200)|
| 1:43:27| Council Member Ryder and then Buget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| Yeah, so with the addition of co-response teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6212)|
| 1:43:39| you're looking at four additional or five additional teams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| It would be three more teams total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| Three more teams for a total of four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| You guys said you interviewed 15 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| for the one person doing the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| Now, so there will be an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| and that, Ms. Gill, will be responded to by anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| potentially, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| Specifically, our RFP is to contract with an organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| to provide that managerial supervisory management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| of the actual clinician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| So the city would not be interviewing clinicians as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| We would be looking and seeking proposals from organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| who would then take on that hiring and management role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| So just to clarify for my own understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| so if it were to be Helen Ross McNabb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| who you are not employing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6270)|
| 1:44:32| you'll go through the same process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| where you do a call and hire interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| These aren't people you already have on your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Yeah, we would go ahead and post it in an interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| to people who are interested in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| And then I'm going to ask you a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| that maybe you don't have an answer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| but when you did calls and interviews with CAHOOTS and STAR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| and I guess the Houston program, does it have a cool name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| Well, we talked to the Houston Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| so I don't know what they call their co-responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| They don't have a cool name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| It's not one that's sticking my head anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| When you talk to those programs to talk to them about lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| and so we don't do things that they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| what is something maybe that, because we haven't talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| what you didn't do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Is there anything that you would share that you learned from those calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| other than what you did do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| What was something you were like, oh, we were thinking of doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| but now that you guys told us, or they said, don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| What are the lessons learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| And if you can't answer me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| Well, I mean, I think some of the things they encouraged us to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6338)|
| 1:45:43| is having our co-responder clinician wear a vest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| because safety was very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6346)|
| 1:45:47| We do not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| You do not do that currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| But that was advice you got from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| That was advice we got that we chose not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| We.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| There's some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| If it was a situation where I felt that she needed a vest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| I would tell her to stay in the car until we got it secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| What we want is that I don't want her to be identified as an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| in any way, shape, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| I'm the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| She is a social behavioral health specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| That's her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| She's not there to be the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| and I don't want her to be the police or misidentified as the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| And I will even say in some of the co-responder things we went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| at CIT conferences, that was one of the big things that stood out to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| was people going in with vests on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| I was like, what in the world are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| I think because we had a unique history with programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| with KPD and law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| that we had programs that were, I'm going to call it like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| it wasn't a co-response, but it was a quick response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| So if law enforcement was on a scene, they could call McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| and then we would come at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| but it wasn't immediate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| I think we had a long history of providing services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| so I think that's where we were already ready for this co-response model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| and we were way ahead of that because they've been wanting to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| So I felt reassured when we were talking to the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| about what they were doing around co-response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| The alternative response programs that they were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| was something that was different for us and what we learned a lot about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| But the co-response, we felt like we had a good implementation and a rollout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| and I think that's why it's been pretty successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| So we know Denver is doing both, but Houston only does co-responder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| They don't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| I think they are going to roll out an alternative response program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| but I had heard that at a conference recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| but I didn't confirm that with them since that conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| but I think they're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| I'll leave it at that for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Just real quick because it's been a minute since you said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| What is the timeline for the RFP going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| and having the other three response teams up and ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| So I'll kick off from an RFP perspective, and then, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6501)|
| 1:48:25| we can only talk hypothetically because we don't know who we would partner with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| but the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| But we have a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| We have a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| So the goal is that we would have no lapse in service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| and that contract is coming to an end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| So we would want to put the RFP out potentially this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| It's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| So that will go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| It will be open for a minimum of three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| The evaluations, depending on how many we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| oftentimes can run anywhere from a two-week process to a five-week process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| I think in this case, depending on the responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| We would look to make sure that we can move pretty quickly through that review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| because we want to ensure that this service does not lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| And if we do switch, hypothetically, again, if we were to switch a partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| we would want to give ourselves lead time to get that new partner positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| to launch so that there's no gap in service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Follow-up to that, the current contract ends in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| And does the current contract, if that has not been all accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| do we have the ability to extend for a short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| so that there is no lapse in service until we can identify the entire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| We have some ability to do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| It would be very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| but that is what we would look to execute if we can to provide an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| very distinct from a renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| That's what I meant, just an extension for 60 days, 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| something just so that we don't lose what we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| That would be my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| And then follow-up to that is the, I keep going back to the SIMS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| I think I'm saying that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| the evaluation process of what all we have, which is always a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| When is the expectation that that might happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| or what has to happen to trigger that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| Because that seems like time is of the essence to get that done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| Well, I think to Councilwoman Parker's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| I think this is an important step that needs to be taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| so that we can see as a community, not just as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| the connections between these different resources that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| So, again, this was a model that in the past has worked very successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| to be orchestrated by a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| who can really bring those partners to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| so it's not simply a city effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| And so I think that that is a conversation that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| as part of the follow-up from this workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| and our compiling of these recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| we would be looking for grants or other resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| potentially even from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| or other partners who might join us in resourcing an effort like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| that could be led, depending on where the money comes from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| by the city, by someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| but nonetheless trying to get that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| so that we can bring those parties to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| and move that process forward with, again, I think McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| would be a critical partner in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| based on the experiences that they've had with the previous model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| I don't want to speak too much for them, which is why I'm hedging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| How much does a facilitator like that cost, typically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| I mean, do we know, $200,000, $250,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| I can reach out and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| I would be curious, because there are local foundations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| that care a whole lot about health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Yes, good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| Council Member Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I think I just wanted to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| just based on some of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| is that I don't hear anybody saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| that they're against alternative models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| I mean, it does sound like that there's, in my opinion, no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| that models that are interdependent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| I mean, the co-responder model that we have versus an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| and that it's not versus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| But I think, too, I mean, we're still in a learning curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| and a lot to be learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| And to refine the current strategy or the current program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| there's got to be a strategy to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| how to best provide the continuum of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| And I just think with the training, be it 911 dispatchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6769)|
| 1:52:56| and we're at a grassroots level of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| But I've got to say, in less than 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| we've established this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| we've committed to three more co-responders' teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| to continue to build and address what we all identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| as a critical need in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| So I just wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| I mean, I understand the alternative models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| but I think we've got to get this right first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| and then identify, as you all have established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| I mean, every community is different, and the complexities are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| And really, it is complex, and there are resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| and there are gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| So I just wanted to say that just as far as moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| But I think we've done a remarkable job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| in a very short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| and I commend all of you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| Council Member Figa, did you have another comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| Yes, just to follow up a bit on my colleague's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Yeah, the co-responder and the alternative models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| they're not completely separate models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| And both of them depend on the police to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| The main difference is the alternative model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| doesn't send the police out at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| but then they call if they need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| This model sends a policeman out first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| but then if they find out he's not needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| then they relieve him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| So in some ways, it's just a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| And we can try this particular program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| and if we see that it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| or if we don't need to send a policeman out on every call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| we can adjust it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| The real problem that will never be solved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6877)|
| 1:54:42| is you can't really assess a situation over the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| You really don't know until you get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| And so I think we proceed with really having these discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6890)|
| 1:54:58| and working out these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| I really appreciate what you did reaching out to the other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| I came away from this workshop with a much better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| of what's been tried in other cities and how they've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| And so we will just continue to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| I think expanding the program we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| is definitely, definitely a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| But as I said all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I'm not saying that's mutually exclusive to later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| adjusting the program and maybe possibly having both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Some cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| So anyway, thank you for your information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| It was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6941)|
| 1:55:42| I just have one final comment that I forgot to share earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| and it was about the follow-up calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| You know, I think in health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| follow-up calls are always welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| I think in criminal justice issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| follow-up calls are hardly ever welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| And so that's one thing I wanted to ask us to be weary of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6963)|
| 1:56:23| If we find that following up becomes more monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| that behavior that could lead to future jail time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| then it is not the health care type of follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=6995)|
| 1:56:45| It's really in line with KPD's usual policing tactics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| where when there's been an incident of crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| KPD returns to the site of the crime to monitor the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| because others might have been exposed to the crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| There might be witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| There might be retaliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| This is what I've been explaining about a strategy that KPD uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| and I would hate for a policing strategy to be used in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| follow-ups regarding mental health issues in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Yeah, I would like to, you know, every follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| most of the follow-ups are done by Lily, who is not police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| And if there are any co-follow-ups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| that would be a face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| It's done from a community policing perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| and from a very how are you doing and checking up on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| At no point would any of us be involved in something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| That was the goal was to further criminalize somebody with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| follow-up call in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| And that's why I really want to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Just to say it in the way that I said it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| that we monitor any unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| because I can't imagine that would be an intended goal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| program, but I worried it would be an unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| That someone might perceive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| It's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| I answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7100)|
| 1:58:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| The only question that I have, Sergeant Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| I heard you mention transport a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| that there may be an occasion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| In the event that there needs to be a transport, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| to Moccasin Bend, would that person need to go through the ER?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| Yeah, so they have to be medically cleared first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| If they're going to be committed to a place like Moccasin Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| they've gone through at least two steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| which is mobile crisis or a physician has said that they need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| committed to a long-term facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| The sheriff actually handles the transportation from the ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| down to Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Once they get to Moccasin Bend or another facility like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| the doctor on site at that location also has to say that this person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7144)|
| 1:59:08| needs to be committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| So there's three levels of where this person could be immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| turned back around and sent right back out to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| And the sheriff's department will tell you that they do that quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| because you're dealing with someone who's in crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| they go to the hospital to get medical clearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| the physician says that they need to be placed in a long-term facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| By the time they get down to Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| that crisis might be over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| And so they're more stable at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| So this doctor's not seeing the same thing that the nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| or the doctor at the hospital or we saw on site or mobile crisis saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| through a conference call or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| So a lot of times they are coming back quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| And I think that that's one of the frustrations that we all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| with someone that we're seeing what we're seeing on scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| And when they get there, when we feel like that's a good time for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| to be really assessed and talked to about how they can feel better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| and be better and whatever services they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| that would be a good time for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| But it's not working that way right now, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| because a lot of it is just turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| They've got to open beds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| So they're turning people away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Does NoxonBin take voluntary admissions or only involuntary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| They take both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| And another question that I had is when you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| when you guys are out on calls, is your body cam used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| My body cam is used, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| And you may or may not have this information, just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| Are you seeing more calls coming in from family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| or friends calling about someone in crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| versus the individual calling themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| I think it depends on the acuity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| A lot of times it is family and friends calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| They're not making good contact with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| or they made some statements that they want us to check out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| and go talk to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| So, yeah, we are seeing that quite a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| You know, I'm glad that we have this pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| and we have some data that we can take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| And, you know, I'm in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| I think that, you know, my colleagues have stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| there's been some really good questions and dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| and thank you for the presentation today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| is that there is space for coexistence of two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| when we get to that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| And I think that there will, I'm sure we'll have more dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| but this is a service that is greatly needed in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| I think we all would be remiss if we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| that we did not realize that the gaps and the needs are great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| as it relates to treatment facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| and services for, you know, our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| and our community members who are suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| from mental health issues and substance abuse issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7316)|
| 2:02:02| and also support for the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| who are entrusted with their care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| And so definitely understand that on a personal level myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| And so just thank you for the work that you're doing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| I just want to add one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7337)|
| 2:02:19| I think I'm grateful for the work that's gone into evaluating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| the other cities and different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| And we've come up with our own model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| of what sounds like accountable kindness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| I think that's really a strength of our community here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| that other communities don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| So I think that's worth celebrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| I also think it highlights a need that's greater than the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| which is the lack of a mental health facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| The fact that we're talking about transporting folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| an hour and a half south is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7370)|
| 2:02:55| And so at the state level, I would continue to ask everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| in our community to advocate for assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| from a state-level perspective on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| There are folks who are awaiting simple court hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| because they have to be assessed by Moccasin Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| So we have folks sitting in our county jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| waiting for court dates because there's no beds available here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| there's no one here to assess them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| until they go to Chattanooga and back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| and are assessed by a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| So the mental health facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| the lack of one of those here in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| is extremely impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| And a lot of what we talked about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| results from the lack of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| So the city can only do so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| We're doing as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| We've learned from other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| But I just want to highlight the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| that this is the tail of the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| Mental health and the lack of a facility here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| is the driving force behind a lot of these calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| So we're trying to make lemonade out of lemons here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| and you all are doing a good job, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| Council, are there any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| Another question you guys might not have an answer on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| to tag onto what Councilman Smith just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| Do you guys have a lobbyist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| or is there a way that you guys plug in and advocate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| Yeah, hello, Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| We don't lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| I don't mean you personally, but maybe organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| that you plug into in terms of the state ledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Because that's some of what hinders us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| So we are a member of a statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Tennessee Association of Mental Health Organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| and all of the mental health centers in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| are members of that same organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| And I think we certainly talk about issues that are numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7487)|
| 2:04:54| for adults, children, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| and we do have a lobbyist through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| If not, we will now go into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| We have three people who are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| Thank you, everyone who is attending today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| and those who have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| We ask that you would please direct your comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| to the issue that we are discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| that you would please not use any profanity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7527)|
| 2:05:30| or personal attacks on Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| In the event that you do, I will call you out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| If you continue, we will call you out of order again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| and ask you to please be seated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| and we'll go on to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| The first person we have signed up to speak is Amelia James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Amelia James, if you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| if you'd please come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| and give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| Amelia James, 1925 Aylor Ave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| I am a licensed clinical social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| and member of Knoxville HEART,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| which is the Healing East Tennessee Alternative Response Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| And what we're really excited and passionate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| is getting an alternative response team here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| As we know, an alternative response team pairs a medic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| and a behavioral health specialist to respond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| be dispatched by 911, and respond to emergency calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| I want to clarify first that alternative response teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| respond to more than just mental health crises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7580)|
| 2:06:23| They can provide mental health and substance use assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| first aid, medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| They can work with houselessness issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| provide de-escalation, mediation of conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| referral to resources, and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| with the goals of just increasing safety for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| and reducing interactions people are having with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| So I want to talk specifically about some of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| The presentation says that co-response teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| can respond to all types of calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| but as we've seen, the reality of our Knoxville team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| is that they're not responding to all types of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| A third of them were for suicidality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| Half of them required transport to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7619)|
| 2:07:02| Insisting that mental health professionals and medics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7622)|
| 2:07:05| need to be escorted by police to these calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| reinforces the idea that people who are experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| mental health crises are inherently dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| I think it's interesting that the presentation said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| that alternative response requires community buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| as if co-response doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| The fact that part of the reason McNabb chose co-response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7642)|
| 2:07:26| was that it felt that they didn't feel like it required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7646)|
| 2:07:30| community input and buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| demonstrates some of the significant issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| HART has with how this model was rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| The presentation for co-response says that there doesn't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| to be any changes in 911 dispatch procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| However, a $300,000 program expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| for just six missed calls a week just doesn't add up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7667)|
| 2:07:52| In comparison, Denver Star's alternative response team pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| which included one team with one van only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| they responded to 748 calls in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| with zero police backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| They had the option to call for police backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| and called police backup zero times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| Again, I want to say 748 calls versus 199 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7693)|
| 2:08:20| Their program, again, did that training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| with CAHOOTS on their dispatch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| As part of HART's proposal for an alternative response team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| we include doing that consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| so that our 911 can be trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| and we can get more calls triaged appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| Speaking of Denver Star, I just want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| that the reason that they have both a co-response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| and an alternative response model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| isn't necessarily because the city wanted both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| I think Knoxville can have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| Like, let's do it. We are ready to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| However, Denver has a co-response team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| because the state decided to pilot co-response teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210624?start=7738)|
