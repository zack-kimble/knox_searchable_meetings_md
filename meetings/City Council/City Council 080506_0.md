| 0:02:09| We will move on to approval of minutes from our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| I'll take that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Any discussions, comments, corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Moving to items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| I believe everyone on council received the same e-mail I did from Lamar with regards to 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| They have requested that 12A be postponed for 30 days in light of our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| and especially in light of the fact that one of the recommendations on the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| one of the recommendations from MPC, which seemed to be one that was trying to reach common ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| we've discovered has some legal ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| And so they've requested that we postpone our discussion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| I would like to make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| When I think about the state of affairs as it relates to billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| I don't see a negative impact with regards to the actual state of affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| We don't get any more billboards added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| We don't have any more taken down if we postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| And I think it may be reasonable to have maybe Lamar, have some folks from Scenic Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=201)|
| 0:03:27| maybe some folks from the city and maybe the MPC and some other folks maybe sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| And I know we've gone over and over this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| but maybe to sit down and say, is there a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| or another option that we could look at besides the 12C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| which seemed to have some legal ramifications but also seemed to accomplish two tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| and that was maybe to allow digital billboards but to also take some down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| And I quite frankly thought that was a good recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| but I understand from our council and the city that that may be fraught with some legal problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| that we postpone 12A for 30 days at the request of Lamar Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| I see other lights, but I'm going to go to discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| So if you would turn off your lights unless it's about discussion of this item for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I'm going to go to Councilman Becker and then I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| This is just a process thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| I almost think since this is the time for sort of the postponements that are agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| that we put this off and pick it up when it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| That's what I was going to say because there's a good amount of the agenda that we can get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| and people can go home because I know the postponement will be debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=271)|
| 0:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| That was what I was going to say also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Oh, no, substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| I guess a request to hold off until it hits the regular part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| It's going to be like the fifth thing we take up, so it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Is the proposer okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| We're waiting and then discussing the postponement when it comes up on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| In the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| Yeah, there's no problem with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=303)|
| 0:05:04| In the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Then we're going to just hold the discussion and bring it up when it comes up at the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| where it's slated on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| This is actually very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| On 12F, this is the parking and front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| I've been requested by people to ask for a postponement and a workshop on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| and I'll hold that for when it comes up on the agenda, but let people know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So there's not a request for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| I'm firmly committed to asking for a two-week postponement on 12H right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| 12H is the Millartown Pike rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| I was contacted by the attorney for the lady who owns this property, just wanted it put off two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| And that second stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| It's 12H postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Other items to deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| I don't think we have any consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| No consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=379)|
| 0:06:19| In the interest of having a full agenda, because there's nothing right on top of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| I have no mayor's report other than Mrs. Mitchell's 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| 6A is an application for renewal of a retailer certificate for Southside Package Store, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| located at 3223 Chapman Highway, owned by Carolyn Hicks, administrator of the estate of William M. Gates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=391)|
| 0:06:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Moving to report to Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Two items very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| First, I'd like to send a shout-out to the award-winning Hubert Smith radio show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| I know Hubert is here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I had the pleasure of being on his show and being interviewed this past Sunday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| wherein he actually broke, to my surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| the story that the beer permit this evening from Sodexco was going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| So I don't know what his sources are, but he apparently was on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| And I'll give him some credit there and kudos and a shout-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| He does a good job on his show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| Secondly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| You've heard ratings hit an all-time high when you were on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| I think the e-mails have just been pouring in, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| And also, secondly, I'd like to recognize Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| We received some information earlier with regards to our good friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Councilmember Pillow's daughter in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| And I don't mean to put that out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| but I'm going to ask him if he'll please take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| and say a prayer for the Pillow family and for her daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| Let's stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| And, Councilman Pillow, you prayed for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| except for the person who's heaviest on your heart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| and that's your daughter and your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| So, therefore, she's family to us, Lori, who's in Park West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you, Father, for your generosity, your kindness, your covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| I pray your healing on Lori.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| I pray that you would operate through the physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| through the care of the support staff to take care of her and to bring her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| I thank you that she is surrounded by a lovely, caring, and generous family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| I pray that they would be reunited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| that they would be energized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| and that they would just show Lori deeply how much they care for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| and how much we care for her mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| We pray all these things in your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you, Vice Mayor and Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Thank you, Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| Some days good things happen, and other days not so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| But on one day last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| there was something that I really want to share with everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| because I'm not really sure if everyone was aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| But Councilman Hall, in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| which I sort of like to claim a corner of it as my own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| we had a very exciting groundbreaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| And I think it was one of the most wonderful events I've ever attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| And it's great news, which I'm sure most people are aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| that the FBI has chosen Knoxville to locate their regional facility here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| But I was particularly struck by the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| and the Carnegie Development Group out of Cleveland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| and just how they handled this and how they managed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| how much they care about their workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| and how much they care about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| and how excited they are to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| And some really good comments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| The mayor and I enjoyed that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| And Mayor Haslam, thanks for letting me comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Steve, we missed you, but I shook everybody's hand twice just for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Thank you, Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I would just like to remind the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| that there will be a public meeting a week from this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| which is May the 15th at 5 p.m. here in the Assembly Room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| to discuss the proposed public arts policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| The mayor called together a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| to study the issue of display of art in public places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| And a draft policy has been published,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| and that will be available that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| And the public is cordially invited to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| and learn more about that policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| and discuss and ask questions if they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| 5 p.m., May the 15th, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| About three weeks ago, I announced a public meeting on the Vestal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| well, specifically in Vestal concerning the Flinnegan School property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| and a proposal by John Lawler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| and the 10-year planned in homelessness staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| to try to do something with that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| That meeting was rescheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| and it is Monday, the 19th of May, at 6.30 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| at the South Knoxville Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Any other reports from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 17, Article 6 of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| so as to regulate the booting of vehicles parked within the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Each member of council should have some amendments to the ordinance that we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Really, it's further explaining with regards to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| and it was given out at our earlier to each member on council dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| I guess, more specifically identifying minimum size for the signs that would be used in a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| so that no one would come back with an objection that the signs were too small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| or I couldn't find the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| So we've asked that some language be put together for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| With adding an issue for individuals being able to use a valid credit card to pay for their citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=742)|
| 0:12:33| it was absent that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| And one of the things we're discovering, I've had complaints about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| is that especially when it deals with maybe some of the students on campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| who may have this booting occur late at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| and then they're required to come up with cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| which means now they're going to have to go somewhere on the strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| and try to go to a teller machine in the dark, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| They're not allowed to possibly use a credit card and not only facilitate the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| but keep folk maybe in the wee hours from having to jaunt about town just to find an ATM to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| and come up with the $40 cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| So we have those two amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| And I'll ask if there's any comments or questions about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| And also, Mr. Swanson, how best to propose a motion to amend it after we've had our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=787)|
| 0:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| There is someone that wants to speak, but I'll go ahead to Ms. Rodino.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| My comment is to the main motion and not the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Are we going to --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| How do you want to handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| There's no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| There is someone that wants to speak to the main item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Can we amend it and then the individual speak to the main item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| There's no motion to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| I think he said he was going to come back to that at the end of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| I make a motion that we amend 12A by adding the language on the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| with regards to Section 17-515, booting of vehicles on private parking lots and signs required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| and also with regards to Section 17-516, fee charge for removing boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| And I would ask that a copy of that be made to the record and provided to Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| I'll add my second to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Now, do you want to speak on the amendment or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| So we're going to go ahead now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| There is someone that wants to speak, so I am going to come back to him probably after the amendment gets voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| is how we're going to handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Yeah, I guess my only question on the amendment is the sign size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| It says the lettering shall be not less than one-half inch high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| That seems fairly small for a sign to be seen by a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| And does somebody have a good sense if that's big enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| I'm not a visual person, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| Just for the record, that's not a – I think that was after discussion with Officer Huskey who was here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| and also the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| I'm not sure how they came up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| It may be from looking at examples in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| So I wanted to make sure everybody understood it's not a number I picked out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| I think they came through consultation with Officer Huskey and also the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| and I think they feel that's sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Mr. Hookless, we're speaking on the amendment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Second, I want to follow up on Councilman Becker's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| If you have a sign that's a minimum size of two feet by three feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| and the minimum lettering size is half inch, half inch is that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| I would entertain a friendly motion to increase the size of the lettering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| Friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Well, I mean, I guess if somebody from, you know, police or law has a comment that that is a good size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=923)|
| 0:15:29| I'll, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Officer Huskey is here, and I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| I just wanted to make sure that we had signage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| My concern was on some of the larger lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| if it's a small sign that's posted on one of the poles in the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| and a person comes in a side entrance and parks in the corner and doesn't see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| then we've got an issue of where that person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Let's see what he has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Ms. Evertine with the law department actually got with Anita Cash that works in, I believe, zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| and that's a number that she had come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| I think we require that on some other signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| So in terms of where you and the police department are standing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| we don't have an opinion on the lettering size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| And, Anita, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Allison and I discussed the minimum size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| We did not discuss the size of the lettering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| So we don't know where the lettering, minimum lettering size came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| Let's stay right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I thought I still had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I'm going to make a motion then to amend that to a minimum size of one inch, lettering size of one inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| There's an amendment to the amendment that would change that to one inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| We are going to come back to the main issue here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Actually, under Robert's rules, you can't have an amendment to an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So why don't we just have this as a friendly change to the original motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Yes, Mr. Pillage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| My comment was that Mr. King's face looks like he had a comment he wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| I've been wondering what his face looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| Forgive me if I misread your face, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| Anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| The only thing I thought of, we don't typically make those kind of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| but I'm always surprised at how large you have to make letters for drivers to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| Here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| The street name sign is six inches, the letter height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Of course, that's a different situation, but that's the only thing I thought of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| This is a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| By reading this, is there anything else going to be on this sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| Or is this just a sign that this tell that gives this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| I think with regards to the actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Put your microphone down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| The actual resolution, I think, says what the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| It says what should be included on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| It's section 17, 515B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| Yes, the sign provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| If you look on page three of the ordinance, Councilman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| you'll see section 17-515B, and that's the information that must be on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| It doesn't have to be that version exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| but it must identify the property as a private lot and that it will be booted at the owner's expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| name, telephone, address of the person or company who's authorized to remove the boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| And also the other information about the boot may be removed any time of day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| So that's the information that's going to be on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It won't be all of that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| It will probably be a summary of that, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| I guess it still just sounds awfully small to me for a sign that size if you want people to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| I actually tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| I was trying to just get it up a little bigger, but it may be inadequate yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Well, I think the interesting part is this is the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1150)|
| 0:19:10| I would assume, I would hate to say that all the letters have to be six inches high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| You know, the truth is if we're really getting detailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| we should say there should be something that says, notice to drivers, it's in huge print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| The rest of it could be small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I think we have to assume somebody is going to know what they're trying to do with these signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| and is going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| Counselor Bader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Yeah, Mayor, I just wanted to pick up on what Councilman Hall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| I think what we ought to concern ourselves with is it ought to be like a warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| People ought to know what they're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| And so you want it, you know, reasonably large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| And if somebody does park in there and gets booted, then you can refer to the sign, well, it was five inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| You know, letters were big enough you could have read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| And so I think we ought to pay attention to this because having lived in a city where boots are pretty frequent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| it's going to unnerve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| And if we can lessen that by, you know, requiring larger sized letters, I think we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1204)|
| 0:20:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| You want to go with a larger letter than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| I think, you know, Steve King says six inches for street signs, you know, at least half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| Is that a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Yeah, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment, three-inch letters minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| The original maker of the motion accepts that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Seconder does, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Now, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| I guess I'm a little concerned that, you know, we've got something that potentially the sign on the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1241)|
| 0:20:48| that says this printed by Union Shop Local such and such is now really huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| And I'm a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| It's not part of the required language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| This only references the required language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| Lettering not less than one inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| I don't necessarily read it that way, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I think that's understood that we're speaking about the required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| It's under Section 17-515B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Anything else on this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| Ready to vote in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Ready to vote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| I thought it was other signs that were going to cause this much debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| This may be what the individual who signed up wants to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| but members of council received an e-mail from a vendor with some supporting letters from some of his customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| indicating that they didn't feel that the fee was high enough to allow them to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| I guess I just wanted to ask a question of the members who serve on the record commission who are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| how that number was come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| That's not the right sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| How did you come up with the $40 fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Officer Husky is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Well, ma'am, we looked at other cities, and I have a short list here of other city prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| And we also looked at what you get for a tow off private property, and it's $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| So the record commission come with the $40 price as being fair when you get $75 to actually tow the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| And that's comparable to what you saw in other cities, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| Mr. Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| Well, I think I see something else that I might want to address in the form of an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| but I don't know if this is the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| It probably is since we were already amending the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Under Section 17-515, Section C, it says, when the booting service is contacted to remove the boot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| the designated employer of the company will respond within one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| It doesn't address what happens if they don't respond within that one-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| To me, if they don't respond within the time allotted under the ordinance, then there should be repercussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| In other words, what I'm thinking about is an amendment that would say they have to remove the boot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| and they cannot charge a fee if they don't respond within that one-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| And otherwise, why put that in there if there's no penalty or no enforcement mechanism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| So I'd be interested to see if Councilman Becker has his light on anybody else before I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I'm wondering if it's appropriate to refer this back to the record commission for further study at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| If I could interject, there is actually a penalty provision built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| It's in Section 17-517.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| If you don't follow the terms of it, it's subject to the general provisions of 1-9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| which is the city court citation of $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| So that, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| So your interpretation of that is that if they do not show up in one hour, then they're subject to a $50 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| If they violate any of the provisions, if they don't have the appropriate signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| if they don't show up within the specified hour time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| But that doesn't address, they could still, they could put a boot on there and not show up for 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| still charge the person $40, and then they're subject to a $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| Bad trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| They won't be in business long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| They lose $10 every time they boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| It depends on how often they get challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| But the individual is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| If Councilman Holquist is okay, I'm okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| I guess I'll leave that, given that explanation for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| We'll see how it works, if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| I would, I know there's someone that would like to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| If you'd step to the podium and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Michael McGovern, attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| My address is 3021 Tazeville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I'm here tonight on behalf of three companies, United Parking Enforcement, Wheel Stoppers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| and Floyd's Record Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| I believe those are the three companies that are currently performing this type of service in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| If they're, they may be the only ones that are performing this type of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| I have, I'm sorry I arrived a little late and didn't get a chance to, I've got some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| I don't know which way to, I could pass it, but I'd like to pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| You'll just come hand it maybe to the end of the row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| We'll pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| You can resume your time at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1551)|
| 0:25:59| I guess first I'd like to address the amendments first and then the original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| With regard to the amendments, the signage thing, not to belabor that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| I have a copy of Gatlinburg's ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And as many of you probably know, Gatlinburg had a serious problem with this booting situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| They passed an ordinance a couple of years ago, about a year and a half ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| And with regard to the signs, their sign says that the lettering shall be two inches in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| No restriction on the size, the outside border of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| It just says that the lettering shall be two inches in height for what that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| That's what city Gatlinburg did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| With regard to the credit card provision, the credit card amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| certainly that's reasonable considering the wide use of credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| And there's really not the danger to the merchant that there used to be years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| My clients would suggest that rather than say valid credit card, that it say major credit card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| or even say MasterCard and Visa, which are the two most commonly accepted cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| and limit it to those two types of cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Now, with regard to the original ordinance, certainly as has been pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| this matter came before the record commission and is often booting is often compared to towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| However, I guess people have been parking where they're not supposed to park since the first vehicle was invented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| and probably have been towing from illegally parked spots since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| And booting has evolved recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| It's kind of a friendly alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| And the principal benefit to booting over towing of a violator is that their car is not removed to another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| and they suffer the inconvenience and the extra cost of going to retrieve their vehicle, which can be very burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| So booting is a friendly alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| The principal complaint, if you will, that my clients have with regard to the initial ordinance is the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| The rate is not compensable for the service rendered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Again, booting is often compared to towing, and as Officer Husky just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| well, we kind of figured that the current tow rate is $75, so, you know, booting maybe $40 would be a fair rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1696)|
| 0:28:26| I've provided you with a list, a survey that has been done of rates comparable for jurisdictions around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1706)|
| 0:28:36| for booting services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| And you'll see they range from $300 in Milwaukee down to $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| Actually, I didn't keep a copy myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| I gave them all to the council, but whoever the last one was I think was third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| But there's a wide range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| And the thing that I think is important to note is that at the bottom of the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| most of the lower rates are where government entities are booting cars primarily for parking violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1736)|
| 0:29:04| And what is not disclosed in the booting rate, what you don't realize there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| is that the boot is just a device to collect a huge amount of parking violation tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| What these government jurisdictions are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| if somebody has $300 or $400 in delinquent parking tickets, they put a boot on the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Well, the boot is just the device to collect the $300 or $400 in parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| It's basically subsidized by the parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| These are not private companies like my clients who are going out and booting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| and they're only charging for their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| They're not collecting $300 or $400 in parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| That's a major difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| So when we're talking about a $20 or $40 fee or as and I've talked to Officer Husky about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| Those, I suggest, are fees that are being charged by municipalities to collect parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| They don't they're not making a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| They're not attempting to make a living doing booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| They are just using the boot as a vehicle or device to collect parking fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| So you can't compare apples and oranges there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| We need to go with the apples, which is the private industry, versus the oranges, which is the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| And my clients are the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| And if you look at the list, those rates are considerably higher and they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Again, making the comparison to towing, booting is much more labor intensive than towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| In towing, it's a one trip to the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| You pick up the car and you leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Booting requires at least two trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| They boot the by an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| They boot the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| They leave the scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| They get a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| They come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| They're required sometimes to spend an hour, an hour and a half, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| negotiating or dealing with the customer, making payment arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Sometimes they come back three times because they come to check on the boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| The customer hasn't come back or they've left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| It's very labor intensive, unlike towing where they just get the car and they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Also, the devices are frequently destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| These devices cost six, seven, eight hundred dollars and they're frequently destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| A towing company doesn't have equipment destroyed like a booting company does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| My clients have overhead expense just in employees, fuel, insurance of $40 in booting a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| Forty dollars doesn't even cover their total expense and certainly doesn't provide for a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| That's why you see such a big difference between the private booting rate and the government booting rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| We'd suggest, I've also provided you with a, with the second page of the handout that I provided you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1887)|
| 0:31:35| is a copy of an ordinance that was proposed in Nashville in metropolitan Davidson County with regard to booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| Now, I will tell you that did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| And I can't tell you why it didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| You'll see that the provision with regard to the rate tied the booting charge to the towing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| to the regulated towing charge in metropolitan Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| And what they did was they said the booting should not exceed the towing charge plus what would have been charged for one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| of storage and whatever that is, whatever that rate is in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| My client suggested that would be a reasonable rate to be included in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| That's one day, whatever the rate is for one day of the base towing rate for a non-consent tow plus one day of storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1942)|
| 0:32:31| Whatever that rate is, I believe it's $95, I think, because I think it's a $75 base rate for towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| Mr. Governor, I think you've hit your five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Just 20 more seconds, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I will tell the council this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| My clients, as I said, booting is a friendly alternative to towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| My three clients have already told me unequivocally they will not boot anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| If $40 they can't do it, they will go back to towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Floyd's Recreation Service is in the towing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| He will just tow cars rather than boot them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| And my other clients will not perform any booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| So we'd ask that the rate be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| You know, I don't think anybody here on council is here to put anybody out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| But I think we're also trying to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| So I would like to defer to the members of the record commission that analyzed this, you know, as a 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| I think relating it to the tow fee that we also regulate makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| And right now we're basically at 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| Fifty percent of the tow fee is 75 percent, a more reasonable alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| I'd like to hear from the members of the record commission and perhaps Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Ms. Pilo, anybody want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Well, I was and maybe it's out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| If you don't mind, I was just going to concur with Ms. Roddy's observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| And I was going to add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| I had just inquired about had Mr. McGovern come before the record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2028)|
| 0:33:55| This was noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| They were public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| And it's disappointing to me that if there needed to be some arrangements made or some consideration for your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| it would have been more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Having served on the record commission for six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I would consider it to have been more appropriate to have come before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| and allowed them to discuss this before it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Mr. Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Sir, could you step back up to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| I had a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| On the sheet that you gave us, St. Paul, Minnesota has set theirs at 75 percent of tow fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2065)|
| 0:34:34| Has your client, have you looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Have your clients considered that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Is that something that would be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Rather than 100 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| I'm not sure why St. Paul set it at 75 percent, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| I mean, this is something you gave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| and that implies that's for private towing fees rather than the government ones that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I don't know what the background, what the underlying rationale was for the $75 rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| That would be, you know, I think $56.25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| Can they make it work as a business proposition at that rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| No, that would not be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Seventy-five percent of the base tow fee would not be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| If I could comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Yes, I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| As I sit on the record commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| basically what we did is Donnie put together a list of close entities, closer cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| and that are similar to us in size, and he gave us the rates that they currently were using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| We discussed it back and forth, and at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| I believe Floyd had a representative there that wasn't happy with the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| But basically, this is where we decided as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and they voted to start at this price and see how it works and what kind of comments that we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| and, you know, go from that point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| So that was how we came up with it based on what Donnie gave us for similar cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| and they weren't government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| They were private rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| I certainly don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Ms. Hulkus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| What he says makes sense about the incentives or disincentives for towing versus booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| To some degree, I don't know if it really makes sense depending on how far away your tow lot is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| and all that, but if you have to go, come back, go again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| then any additional fuel costs that would be entailed by the heavier weight of towing a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| might be offset by the additional trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| And so certainly time is a big issue when you're paying employees by the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| So I wouldn't want to create a disincentive for booting versus towing because I think he is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| I mean, if I were in that position, I think I'd rather have a boot on my vehicle than have it towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| The inconvenience, the potential for damage and having to work that out, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| So my tendency is that I don't understand why it would be a huge problem in my mind to make them the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2216)|
| 0:37:08| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Let me ask you a couple of questions, Mr. McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| When you asked the question a few minutes ago about $56.25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| and I appreciate that math councilman Holquist, you said that would not be an acceptable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Are you saying it's not acceptable or are you saying you can't do business at $56.50 per boot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| The latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| I realized I misspoke as soon as it came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| What I meant was from my discussions with my clients that they could not make a profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| and would not continue to boot cars at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| They can't make a profit or not as big a profit if they were to tow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| They couldn't even make a profit at the $56 rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| What's your understanding of the process that happens when someone comes out to a lot and sees a car and puts a boot on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2268)|
| 0:37:56| Is that the same person that would come out to the lot and then call the tow company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| or is that a person that's a member of the record company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Who do you see as being the person that would come out, identify a vehicle that needs to have a boot on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| and put the boot on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Who is that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Well, my clients are only in the booting business or at least two of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| One of them is in the record business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| But they are called by they have clients that are apartment complexes or parking facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| And somebody from the apartment complex will typically call them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| and tell them that there's a vehicle there that's not supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| They respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| They have dispatchers and they respond to calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| They will respond to a specific call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| So there's not any issue of patrolling around to see if there are violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| There's a response to a specific call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| They do not patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| With regards to the list that you've given us right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| and I appreciate that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| do you have any idea what the total rate is with regards to these cities versus the boot rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| You can compile this list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Do you know what the total rates are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Whether or not they're the same, comparable or more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| So when we're sitting here comparing our $40 versus our $75 apples and oranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| all we have here is I guess one part of the equation from the cities you provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| As far as we know, this could be 50% of the total rate or the exact same, but you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Except for the ones that specifically reference the total rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| And I don't know what the total rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| But all the other ones, those are just the booting rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| I have no idea what the total rates are or if there are total rates in those cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| These are just the charges for booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Officer Husky, and I'm not on the record commission, do you happen to have a listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| that could tell us what cities you compared us to and what rates they were showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| I have not found any that have the same rate as booting to towing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I have checked with Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| It's $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| And he has Gatlinburg on here at $125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| And I spoke with the Gatlinburg police chief today, and he said they didn't have a rate as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| They haven't put a rate with their ordinance as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| Some of mine are the same as his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| San Francisco is $75 with a one-hour response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Their towing rate is a lot higher than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| Charleston, South Carolina, $35 with a 30-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Atlanta is $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| So I have found none that are anywhere close to the tow fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Find any that have the tow fee plus one day of storage like has been proposed here other than the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| I think, that maybe wasn't passed that's been presented by Mr. Governor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I pulled the Denver, Colorado, and I see he has Denver at $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| I pulled the Denver, and it's $20 per 24-hour period, not to exceed $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| So there's a lot of cities that do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| I think there's some that even actually prohibit booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| When did you pull the information from Denver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| When did you pull that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| We pulled a lot of it today, a lot of this additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| and then I had some for the record commission prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Today, Denver, from your understanding, is $20, not $50 per 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| It's $20 per 24-hour period, yes, not to exceed $100, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| I'd like to move to refer this back to the record commission for further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Now we're just discussing that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Yeah, I was going to say that, you know, I agree with Mr. Holquist's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| that we want to have an incentive on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| and I don't know that the record commission didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| We want to have an incentive for people to boot rather than tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| I mean, I think it is preferable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| and I'm not sure the record commission didn't consider it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| but when is the next record commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| It's later this month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| Is it before our next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| It's May the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Let me tell you exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Oh, no, it will be two days after our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| May the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Thursday, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| Anything else to the motion that's on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| which is refer it back to the record commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Let me just process-wise, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| I mean, if we refer it to the record commission and meet on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| it could get on our next agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| There's enough time for it to get back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| I'm wondering if it would make more sense to postpone it until after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| and ask the record commission to consider it just to make sure we don't delay longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2553)|
| 0:42:40| Does that make sense, Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2560)|

| 0:42:56| He came before us time and again six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2576)|

| 0:43:05| and this discussion to the record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2585)|

| 0:47:35| Motions are on the table, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| There's a motion which is to postpone for 30 or I guess four weeks would I guess be the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| We'll go to discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| There are folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| I would ask that maybe the first thing we should do, because they're signed up to speak to the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| and I will let them speak if they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| But, counsel, would you all, we've been through a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| Anything you'd like to comment specifically on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| We're talking about the motion to postpone at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| We will come back and take comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| I know there are some interested folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| As you said, Mayor, given the amount of time that this council has spent in workshop on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| I have difficulty supporting this postponement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| I fear that it really has a chilling effect on citizen involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| I think the community has, on both sides of this issue, has very strong feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| Folks have come out tonight because they thought the issue was going to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| And I hate to discourage folks by continuing to postpone an issue that has been thoroughly vetted by this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| and in the media and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| So I do not plan on supporting the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Well, I appreciate Councilman Roddy's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| I think they're reflective of my sense of this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| After the months that have gone into this, discussions, workshops, all sorts of activity, meetings, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2936)|
| 0:49:05| I do not see it being a healthy or a good thing to postpone at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| I think this council has had enough information, had enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| Unless someone's just really a glutton for punishment, I don't know that there's any real rationale for continuing to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| through the process that we have unless there's really, unless we know new information is going to be put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| I think we've seen and heard what we're going to see and hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| So I can't see supporting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| Ms. Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Initially, when the suggestion came that a postponement might be requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| I took the same position that Ms. Roddy and Mr. Holquist took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| And then, you know, looking back over this long period of time, because I also sat through the entire lengthy session at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=2989)|
| 0:50:00| where there were a number of proposals that were considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| And as you know, there are a number of votes and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And I'm the wisest person in the world that wants to have a day where I have over 200 emails to respond to in the same day, and that was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3007)|
| 0:50:17| But I feel that everything that could become before this council, that should be before this council, has not come before this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3017)|
| 0:50:28| Because, frankly, I am very interested in the larger body, except for one small section, of the Mayor's Advisory Board's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3028)|
| 0:50:40| And I don't think this council has really looked at the important ramifications that are there for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3040)|
| 0:50:50| I'm just one of those people who don't want this to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| I don't want us to make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| I feel I respect the council's decisions on just basically every issue that we have before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3056)|
| 0:51:04| because I think they're usually extremely well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| But there are some aspects of this particular issue that I want us to be very aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| and some ramifications of either passing or not passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| And I would like for some more of that information and some more of that discussion to be available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| Frankly, I'm just not smart enough to figure out how we could do it and have that information before us for consideration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3089)|
| 0:51:38| So that's the reason I changed my position on the wisdom of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| I think this council, and we had a little discussion about this earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| has been willing to continue dialogue and discussion on just about any issue that's come along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3113)|
| 0:52:01| and we've been consistent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| And I know we've had zoning issues and all kinds of issues come before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| and it just goes on and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| And I've had made up my mind on a number of occasions where I stood and had it satisfied my appetite for information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| but I respected the possibilities for some sort of, you know, something to be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3138)|
| 0:52:28| something to be reconciled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| And I think that this issue is sensitive enough that there's all kinds of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| If we act quickly, make a decision, it could be decided in a different format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| I'm concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| and I'm going to remain consistent and request and ask my colleagues to support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3163)|
| 0:52:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| I guess in a lot of ways I agree with Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I think we have been good about saying we'll take time to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I know, Mr. Alquist, you said, I think everything is set on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| Everything's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| Everything's been learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| I think everything has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| I've been surprised many a time at council when I thought everything was said and we postponed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| Things have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| So I think erring on the side of postponing is a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| So I'm willing to support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I always like the idea of giving us more time to think through issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| However, I feel like postponing it commits the same mistake that we made with the committee report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3203)|
| 0:53:30| and that is somehow suggesting to the public that we've already made a decision that we're going to have digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| It's just to what, in what way are we going to have these billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| That's what it feels like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And I feel like we've, we are, I feel like we have all the information we need and we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3224)|
| 0:53:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Since I was the maker of the motion, I just wanted to say briefly, you know, as I look at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| what prompts me also towards a motion for the 30-day request is that, you know, as I look at this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3240)|
| 0:54:09| for me personally, and I can't speak for anyone else on council, I haven't spoken to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| but one of the very attractive proposals on the table was basically taken off the table based on some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3253)|
| 0:54:22| with regards to the legality of it, which would have resulted actually in us having a fewer number of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| which I think is something that's very pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| The question before me then becomes, is there some sort of way to not, to avoid the legal traps, the legal pitfalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3270)|
| 0:54:38| and find a way that possibly could result in a win-win, which may be one that has a fewer number of billboards in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3278)|
| 0:54:46| city of Knoxville and maybe a few billboards or some billboards that are electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| And I think that by voting today, we may be foregoing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| Sometimes a ban of a particular activity or an endeavor is a good thing, but sometimes regulation is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| You know, and that's kind of the question we face here, you know, ban regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| If we ban, you know, it's over and done with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| If we regulate, do we have opportunity to control, you know, future activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| And that's kind of the concern I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| And I think what postponing for 30 days could allow an opportunity to see if there is a way to find that win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| Because I think that even those folk who may not be in favor of billboards in general would love to see some of them come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| And this may be a golden opportunity to figure out how do you do that and not violate any business rights, not violate any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| property owner rights, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Has someone gone out and looked at the specific inventory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| I think we have 400 or so billboards here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| You know, has someone looked at that specific inventory and kind of cataloged it very quickly to see who's impacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3343)|
| 0:55:48| who potentially impacted, and is there some way to bring those parties together and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| if we looked at it from this vantage point, is this something that could work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| And I find that very intriguing to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| And I am not sure, since I was not in with the Mayor's Commission, whether or not that kind of discussion occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| And to allow for that kind of discussion to occur may be a fruitless effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| but it may be an effort that will show that we have completely looked at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| Because I was a little disappointed that we came to the conclusion that one of the recommendations was not legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| would not be the best thing to do legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| But it did pique my interest with regards to is there a possibility to lessen the number of billboards here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| while also regulating it, not violating any property interest rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| and also making our city even that much cleaner and better by taking some billboards out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| And I just would like to maybe see us have that sort of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| or have some minds better than mine engage in that discussion about our current inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| and can we, you know, deal with that issue and not have our legal problems that we think would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3411)|
| 0:56:52| Vice Mayor, if we postpone, what do you propose as a process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| Are you proposing that the committee reconvene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| No, I propose as a process NPC, any of the billboard owners, Lamar, et cetera, scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3421)|
| 0:57:12| get together, especially those folks who have big interest in the inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| and have that frank discussion along with someone from the law department about the legalities of what we did put 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| I mean, number C, whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| And we can't do that, but is there some sort of variation on that theme?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| That within 30 days they report back and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| here's another idea that we can put forth to see if it is feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| This is a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Not that we reconvene the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| I think that would take a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I think they've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| But has someone sat down who has a vested interest, scenic Knoxville for citizens, Lamar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| and those other billboard owners, NPC, and I think Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| Donaldson came up with the initial recommendation, which seemed to be a win-win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| but we found out it may have had some legal problems with somebody from law and say, here's the inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| you know, can we go back and look at this and see if there's a recommendation that may not fly through council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| that could achieve the goal of maybe limiting or lessening the number of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| after what may be dealing with the other side with regards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And I'm just interested in that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| And I don't know if we detailed that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| I'm going to allow, I know, I guess somebody from, there's folks signed up to speak for the original amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| not the postponement, and then some signed up to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| I'd like to maybe ask if one person from each of those could come speak only to the postponement idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| And, Mr. Isaacs, if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| I don't know if Mr. Greave wants to do that for those who are speaking against the original proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| So if you could give us your name, address, and I'd ask you to keep your remarks brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| and really to the point of postponement if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of council, Gregory P. Isaacs, 5213 Bent River Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| and I suppose, unfortunately, 440 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| We are asking, council, for your reasonable, careful, and deliberate consideration of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3538)|
| 0:59:08| I have been involved in this process since February of 07 prior to the time there was a scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3548)|
| 0:59:17| I have dealt with people on both sides of the issue and have told my client and their corporate council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3557)|
| 0:59:25| that I felt our government was open-minded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| Whether they agreed or didn't agree, they would give you a fair shot before we drew the line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3570)|
| 0:59:37| Respectfully, we spent a great deal of time in MPC looking at issues and there were four options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| There was an A option, no digital billboards, a B option that was kind of a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| that was a hybrid of the mayor's task force, and C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| There were four options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| We met with many of you and different council people felt different things being very intriguing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3596)|
| 1:00:03| The council for MPC thought C2 was very viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| When we got to this level, I understand that your council and other council for the city agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| that one of the compromise alternatives was flawed legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3616)|
| 1:00:22| That was communicated to me on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We didn't wait until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| We met on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| As soon as we decided that the landscape had changed, we sent out an email signaling to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| that we were going to ask for a brief continuance to see if we can approach this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| if it can be resolved, and if it can, fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| I think that's what good policy is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Please don't get caught up in whether you agree with my client or scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| What we want is a good faith effort for careful, deliberate, and reasonable debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| about important governmental policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| That's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| Landscape has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| It just changed Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| We're asking for 30 days to figure out what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| We want to deal with you in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| We're the ones that stand to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| We're the ones that have structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| But we told people on this dais in February that we would be reasonable and work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| I'm asking for you to work with me for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Mr. Greave, would you like to speak just to the point of the postponement, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| And I realize there's other people besides Mr. Greave, but in kind of the interest of just getting to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| I'm going to ask him to represent that group for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I'm Wayne Greave, architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| I live at 3640 Escagna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Frankly, I'm a bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| We came tonight prepared to address the issue, which we understood was going to be before city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| We did not find out until last night at 534 that there was going to be a request for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| And so basically our board, Scenic Knoxville, which has met, has prepared itself for the discussion on digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3733)|
| 1:02:23| However, in finding out about the postponement, I've put together a few notes and a few comments that I would like to make about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3743)|
| 1:02:33| First of all, I'm not totally understanding on why we are or why Lamar is asking for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| especially at a council when we asked for the postponement more than a month ago and asked for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| The comment was that they wanted to move on, that they'd been through this long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| So, again, a bit confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Some of the questions we have is if there is a postponement, first of all, what's 30 days going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| How do we put together a group of people to discuss issues that have been discussed over the last 18 months from the legal standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| And all the particular issues that have to do with regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| Let me just say that Scenic Knoxville is and has and will go on record of saying that they do not want digital billboards in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| If you do put together a study group, you know, again, who's going to be on the study group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Who's going to represent the citizens, the citizens that spoke up on the 2001 when we had the prohibition of billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3807)|
| 1:03:37| How does that take effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| If you do come up with recommendations, are those recommendations going to have to go back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Are we going to have the whole process all over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I'm concerned that 30 days is not enough time to continue to look into this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| So who are the members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| How long will the study group meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| And, you know, what is the reason for the delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| The other thing is, and the other point that I was thinking about, and this might be a way to handle the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| that if the ordinance before you does not work, if it's not legal from what we're finding out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| if those points are not accurate, then why not go ahead and vote this ordinance recommendation down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3855)|
| 1:04:22| and then, if you want to, start all over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| But let's make a decision, number one, on if this ordinance does not stand the test of legality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3865)|
| 1:04:33| then let's go ahead and vote it down and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| The other thing is that by doing that, then there is that possibility, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3876)|
| 1:04:48| that you do put together a study group and you begin to look at it from all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| So as far as we're concerned, we would prefer not to see a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| We'd like to see the city council move forward and do the right thing and go ahead and address the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| which is this whether or not you have a postponement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Any other comments from council on just on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| As far as I can recall, and someone can certainly correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| we've had two workshops on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| We have debated or listened to this issue almost as much as we do the yearly budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| I assume everybody on council has copied a letter from a member of the task force in the advertising business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| just sent last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| This process has gone on for nearly 18 months now and later goes on in the letter to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| please push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3949)|
| 1:05:52| I don't, you know, a lot's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| I really don't mean to make light of the situation, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| a little bit of tongue in cheek have, you know, call on inspiration from a great cinematic masterpiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| Everybody here has probably seen Animal House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| I'm thinking of the guy who's bending over getting a paddle applied to his backside and saying, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| May I please have another, and keeps getting it again and again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| You know, you talk to, you know, folks I represent in Fountain City who've been to MPC time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| I mean, this was, you know, at MPC in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| Then it was, you know, before then and after then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| And, you know, they're tried and true folks who take this subject real seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| I mean, Mr. Swanson and I have been having a sidebar conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| and the arguments really haven't changed between now and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| I'm a little bit at a loss of, you know, in most times postponement's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4015)|
| 1:07:03| We've had a good lengthy postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| We've had a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| A task force means you get your say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| It doesn't necessarily mean you get your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| I think, you know, with all due respect that it has gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| We've labored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| The notion that Mr. Greve had of voting the entire thing down and reconvening with a different mix of folks on a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4041)|
| 1:07:33| might really be the way to go rather than this getting kicked back and forth and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| So I hope no one takes any umbrage at what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| You know, I just think that I have serious doubts as to what another postponement could bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| I could support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| And as wearisome as it may seem, talking more can be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4080)|
| 1:08:06| And I would want a good process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| I want to be clear about something and maybe I need to ask the city's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| The way this material gets laid out, it's as if we are making a decision about digital billboards when we already have a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| We have an ordinance that prohibits them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Currently, our ordinance classifies a digital billboard as an electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| And those are limited to 100 square feet in size and they're limited to business signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4112)|
| 1:08:40| So under that regulation, digital billboards are not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| So of all the options, we have a do nothing option and then these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| Sometimes the way this gets framed, it's as if we are going out of our way to prohibit dynamic displays on existing billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4131)|
| 1:09:00| when, in fact, they're already prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| I just want us to be clear that that's, in your opinion, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| In my opinion, they are already prohibited under the electronic message center regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| I guess it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| Mr. Woodhull, who spoke against it now, thinks he could support it and I'm thinking the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| Sometimes discussion does get us places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Mr. Greave raised an interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| This is a question for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| If this group that Mark talked about, you know, some people get together and they come up with a new idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| if it comes back to us, we have to send it back to MPC anyway, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| It depends on the idea they come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| We would have to be able to determine whether this is a concept that MPC has considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4182)|
| 1:09:48| It doesn't matter whether they agreed with it or didn't agree with it, but it must be something that they have considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| If it's something, if they come back with something new that has not been considered by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| then it would probably need to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Well, it's interesting because at some level, we know what MPC considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| and we know how the vote is going to go on that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| And if they come back with that, you know, what happens tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| It almost feels like, and I guess I'll address just the question to the Lamar folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| I mean, it almost feels like it would be quicker if there is a new idea to start over from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| rather than stay at city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| And I can support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I'm never against continuing to talk about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| But I don't know if there is a new idea that comes up that actually is, as the vice mayor says, a win-win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| You're probably better off withdrawing tonight than having a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| That's just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| I don't think they can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| If it came from MPC, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Well, they can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| If they decide that they're happy with the withdrawal, I don't think council is going to debate it this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Any other comments regarding the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| Just ask a question of Mr. Donaldson regarding the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| Do you have any problem participating in a process over the next 30 days or at least a meeting or two or three to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| some discussion about win-win or other options based on your institutional knowledge from the process with MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| You could also be very helpful if it comes back to us in making sure that it could possibly be something that fell within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| the discussions of MPC and, therefore, we could consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Are you willing to participate in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| If it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| For Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| If it occurs, it's my recollection that all four of the possible considerations were discussed before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4295)|
| 1:11:48| Am I recalling that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| In addition to all four, there was a straight up and down vote on the mayor's study committee's recommendations as they were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| That was actually the first motion, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| And there were some other parameters considered that didn't find their way into any one of the four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| My concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| One of my concerns with a postponement tonight is that the ordinance that we are being asked to consider specifies option C2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4333)|
| 1:12:20| around which there is already consensus that that's not a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| So, if this ordinance is considered for vote on the floor tonight, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| we've got to either figure out which other option to amend this with or kick it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| And I guess I think starting all over is a better option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| And I don't see postponement accomplishing that in the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| If we do not postpone and we essentially kill this option 2C, 2B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| whatever it is tonight, we're then relying on the current ordinance to continue to be enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4372)|
| 1:12:59| until such time as something else is put on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I think this council could express to MPC our desire that they revisit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| and that may be the logical way to proceed ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| So, essentially, I'm echoing what I'm hearing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| But to me, from Councilman Roddy and others, but to me that may make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4392)|
| 1:13:19| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| He's lights off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Mr. Donaldson, you all said MPC sends city council or county commission, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| What happened at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| The record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| You've got a transcript?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| It's got a transcript in here of what people say, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| It's a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| The minutes are summarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| But, I mean, we've got the letters in here for and against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| And we have the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| So, if this is what city council is allowed to consider, I'm wondering if killing the whole thing might be the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4428)|
| 1:13:56| If we're really going to get to trying to consider new alternatives to if we're going to find the win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4436)|
| 1:14:05| Because I think we've, as Councilman Roddy pointed out, I think the issues for debate have been framed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4445)|
| 1:14:14| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I would just, so that we don't begin our circular argument, you know, I thought Mr. Swanson a few minutes ago pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4455)|
| 1:14:24| and I always agree with Mr. Swanson's legal conclusions, unless he and I are against each other in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| And then he tends to be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| But I think that, and actually I've never been against Mr. Swanson in court, so that's why he's laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| He's still perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| He's still perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| But I think I understood him to say that as long as it was something that had been considered by MPC in their debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| or discussion, whether or not it is in the summary of minutes or whether or not it is a direct recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| here they voted up or down, we could possibly consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| So I don't want us to think we are restricted to whatever is written in the summary of the minutes of the discussion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| Because, as Mr. Donaldson just said, not only did they consider those things that are attached here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| but they voted on the mayor's task force report, which is a very extensive report that talks about a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| So I think we have a wider berth here than we are considering at this junction with regards to hopefully possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| The other question I have is, and I'm not sure a postponement will occur, but if it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| and I don't mean to put anyone on the spot, but Mr. Greave, I know he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| Would Scenic Knox be willing to have someone sit down and participate in a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| And I know you have to meet with your board and all that sort of stuff, and I don't want to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| but I guess I'm going to ask you, if it is postponed and MPC is willing to sit down, and I assume that since Omar asked for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| they're willing to sit down and anyone else who's part of the billboard industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| and I'm assuming Ms. Poplin could get somebody from the law department to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Would you guys also be, because you're very vital to this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| if it is postponed, would you guys be willing to send somebody or have a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| or you yourself participate in the discussion, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4566)|
| 1:16:16| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| We can put the caveat down that if you respond in the affirmative, that doesn't mean that you're for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| So I'll make sure that's very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| I'm not trying to trap you into saying you're for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| I just want to make sure that you know that there's an open invitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| and that I think you guys are very vital to the process, appreciated your handouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| and the visual aids that we had at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| So I just want to make sure that you heard from me, just as I've asked other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| that I want Scenic Knoxville involved in this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| I didn't want you all to feel I did not by not asking you this specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| No, I appreciate that very much, and I think that on behalf of Scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| we would definitely want to be a part of any dialogue that has to do with the scenic beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| in our environment that has to do with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| And I think that we would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| However, however, if you'll allow me to say this, that I think our feeling is that council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4624)|
| 1:17:12| ought to step up, vote on this particular ordinance, and if you know it's not right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| if you know it's not right for the city, go ahead and vote this one down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| and then let's figure out a way in which a process can be put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| where you do have open dialogue with different citizen groups and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| I'm concerned, frankly, that 30 days, I don't know what and how you get a group together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| in 30 days to try to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| It seems to me that I'm not sure whether or not city council has decided on whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| to allow digital billboards or not allow digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| It seems to me that's the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Then if city council allows digital billboards, then you determine what the regulations are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4673)|
| 1:17:59| It seems like we've got the cart before the horse, and that's a concern that I have about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| But to answer your original question, yes, by all means, Scenic Knoxville wants to participate in anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| that has to do with the future of our city and the vision of where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| But I am concerned about how that process would work and how it would all go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4695)|
| 1:18:20| And frankly, I don't think with what I've gotten involved with in the last six to eight weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| which is more than I ever thought I'd want to know about billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| that 30 days, I'm not sure where we're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| It's sort of like what Ms. Pelos said at the last council meeting or two council meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| So let's decide whether or not we're going to have digital billboards or not have digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| and then let's decide on what the process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| And I agree with you that I think the crux of the matter is that bottom line question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4729)|
| 1:18:58| whether we're going to have them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| My problem is that if we don't have adequate options in front of us to consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| then how can we determine if we answer the question yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| then we don't have any maybe good regulations or recommendations now to figure how we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| You know, if the answer is no, I'd like to make sure that the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| Against the backdrop of there are some viable options on the table as opposed to non-viable options on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| You know, so to a degree, I don't know if we are hampered or hamstringed with our answer to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| because we don't have maybe some good viable options to consider or not or determine that they're just not very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| Right now, the one viable option we had is off the table, whether you're for it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| So if you're for them, you know, you say, okay, well, let's have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| But where do we go from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| If you say, well, we don't have them, are we saying we don't have them because we don't have a viable option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| That's the spot I fill myself in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Also, I'd like to ask Mr. Isaacs to come forward, because you point out a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| And the 30 days came out of their request to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| And my response about what I envisioned happening in that period of time actually came from the question from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| Councilman Woodhull as I kind of sat here and thought through the process that you make a very valid point with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| regards to the period of time and whether or not we just start over from square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| You've heard a lot of this discussion, Mr. Isaacs, about back to MPC starting on square one, whether or not there's enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| Since you all made the request, have you given any thoughts to what could happen over this next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| Well, obviously, you know, as we have entered in this journey with MPC, with the Mayor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| members of Scenic Knoxville, everybody has indicated they want to be reasonable and informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| And we have tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| Now, what we're saying is, as of the workshop, option C2, which we have spoken with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| it's kind of ironic with the Sunshine Law that you have many discussions and you can't talk to you all in a group, as you're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| But that was important to this deliberative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| And there was just a consensus with legal counsel at the last workshop that that was fundamentally flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| So now, instead of having four options, A, no digital, B, the Mayor's Study Committee, or the MPCB option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| which has actually less spacing, we don't have a viable compromise that we have spent time talking to you all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4879)|
| 1:21:29| We have spent time kicking the tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| So let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| We're not here to waste anybody's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| And we respect these citizens that have showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| But to say that one person represents citizens, with all due respect, we represent a business majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| and property owners and many people that use this that can't be here and can't send out 200 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| But we're just asking counsel, as I said in February of 07, we want to sit down at the table and try to be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| But let me tell you, if it looks like that process for 30 days won't work, rest assured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| we won't try to waste anyone's time because this isn't a four-corner stall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| This is something that's very significant to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| There are options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| For example, the Mayor's Study Committee offers twice the spacing as any regulation in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4937)|
| 1:22:25| It would de facto cut the number of digital displays available by 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| And as everyone, I think, agrees, would withhold judicial scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| But we're not asking anything other than a careful, deliberative process for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| And if we feel it can't work, with all respect to Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4961)|
| 1:22:47| we're not going to be participating in an episode of Animal House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| This is starting to feel bad because I think the idea that everybody wants to get at this is that we don't like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| options that are in this packet that we have on our table and we want to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| And I guess I have a question for Mr. Isaacs or Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| It feels now like we're getting ready to vote on who's going to win or lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| And that's not a good place to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| If we're really interested in starting over, I think the smart thing to do would be to say let's withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| And nobody has to win or lose, and we can start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| So I'm feeling at this moment this vote has become a whole lot more about whether there's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| It's sort of a test of strength, and I don't much like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| Maybe that's something that during the 30-day discussion may be considered, and it may result in exploring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5018)|
| 1:23:46| first of all, whether you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| But again, rest assured, this isn't a test of strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| This is a meeting that occurred after the May 1st task force meeting on Thursday, where for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5030)|
| 1:23:59| after talking to council members throughout this process about C2, there was a consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| it was not a legally viable option for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| That was Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| So now we're not wasting anyone's time or talking about power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| We're just asking when we're talking about public policy to make a well-reasoned, careful, deliberate decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| And let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| If you protect the status quo, there is nothing that can happen to the detriment of anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| as it relates to this issue, whether you're for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| And taking a deep breath and seeing if a problem can be solved, I think it's good government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| and I think it works in everybody's favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| In response to Councilman Becker, I don't see this as a win-lose vote, and I agree with Mr. Isaac's last statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| in that if we maintain the status quo tonight, which I see as not postponing this issue, voting on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| but because it is fundamentally flawed, to use Mr. Isaac's language, the C2 option is voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| then we are back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| We haven't tinkered with the status quo, and it allows plenty of time to go back to the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| whether that's creation of a new study committee, whether that's back to MPC, and look at new options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| I don't think postponing this that we have in front of us is productive at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| I just want to remind folks more about the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| The status quo is a lawsuit against the City of Knoxville brought by Lamar Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| The status quo is Lamar Advertising going out and putting up a brand-new billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| doesn't matter if it was electronic or not, putting up a new billboard without any of the permits that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| by the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| That's also part of the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| Final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| You know, with regards to what is fatally flawed, and we're talking not fatally flawed, but legally questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5150)|
| 1:25:57| is the C, I guess, 2 argument, is there are other options on the table through the merits report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| and through what was discussed at MPC that, quite frankly, one of the reasons I'm looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| I'm wondering if we all focused in on C2 and never gave that full thought to B or A or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5169)|
| 1:26:18| And that's the question that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| You know, we could amend this today and say, hey, C2 is legally questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| and most could come forth and say, what about Recommendation B or Recommendation C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| And we could consider that without that having to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| But the question really becomes, has everybody really thought about those options with respect to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| can they be improved upon without violating any legal standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| And that's kind of the juncture that I'm in with regards to the consideration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| So I've said a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| I'm not going to say any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| But my hope is that we postpone and have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| But really, you know, it's the pleasure of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| And I'm sure everybody's heard enough from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Yeah, just in response, Mr. Vice Mayor, I think C is as legally flawed as C2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| This council is not going to adopt B, and A is the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| So I don't, you know, I'm concerned that no matter what we come back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| if there is some agreement, it has to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| I'm feeling like, I mean, I'm beginning to feel like a postponement does not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| I'm going to go ahead and call for the vote on the postponement at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| We will do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5262)|
| 1:27:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| The motion to postpone fails five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5273)|
| 1:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| We now are then back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Is that just a point of clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Well, actually, while the discussion happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| to Councilman Becker's motion or idea to withdraw, I don't, because it came from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| I think what would have to happen is there not to be a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| There would have to be no motion without a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Could it also be, could there be a motion to table this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| And would that accomplish the same thing as a withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| It's not the same thing as a withdrawal, and it's not the same thing as a failure to move forward for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5312)|
| 1:28:42| A table simply puts it on the table until there is an appropriate motion made to take it off of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| Under Robert's Rules of Order, it's a parliamentary move that doesn't often occur in this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| because we usually postpone to a date certain rather than to an uncertain date, which is not to say that it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| We can do a tabling motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| So tabling keeps the ordinance that is in front of us alive, which is the C-2 ordinance, which personally is not what I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| I think there is also the option of a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5360)|
| 1:29:21| Because C-2 is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| I wasn't suggesting that was the only route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Just Councilman Becker had suggested withdrawing, and I don't think that technically it can be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| That was the only point I was making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| I wasn't suggesting that withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| Technically, under parliamentary rules, there is no motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| There's a failure for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| But we have always allowed motions to deny customarily, even though that's not good parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| We have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| And so that's kind of where we are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| You're commenting on the ability of our chairman at that point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| No more likely on city council attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| I have a question for a council attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| You've heard all the discussion and some of my rationale, whether it made sense or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| or confused folk with regards to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Let me ask you if this is possible, especially in light of the consideration that C-2 may have some legal pitfalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5410)|
| 1:30:19| Is it acceptable to refer this back to MPC in light of what we think is a problem with C-2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| And if we do that, that may still give the opportunity for the discussion that I have been suggesting occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| It may take longer than 30 days, but we don't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| We refer it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Or is that something that's fraught with problems in and of itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| A re-referral to MPC would be a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| And let me ask you this, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| If we referred it back to MPC, what would be you all's process in light of this discussion here that I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| and my concern about maybe seeing if there is another option and getting Mr. Greve, getting Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| getting whoever else, the law department, getting everybody together to kind of look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| and even represent it from MPC in light of what you guys have voted on and the legal implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| Would you guys start all over from square one, or would you take it back in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| and maybe try to get a committee to get at our suggestion and kind of see if you can workshop it a little more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5474)|
| 1:31:21| I believe we would start from where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| and examine the discussion about this fatal flaw that I haven't heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| And perhaps if it's an easy fix, we could respond to that very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| And let me say that all my comments assume that my vote is for, you know, digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5496)|
| 1:31:43| and my vote is for proliferation of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| And really my vote is for, you know, can we get some viable options in front of us that meet legal mustering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| I appreciate the hard work you guys did in the vote from MPC on trying to say, well, here's another option to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| So if it was referred back to you guys, you wouldn't have to necessarily start over at square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| You could take all this discussion today, take the concerns that have been expressed by the city law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| our attorney, I think maybe even the attorney from Lamar with regards to C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| and also all the other options you all looked at, maybe convene a smaller group that has citizen participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| MPC, law department, see if there is another potential suggestion or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| Is that something that you guys could do with following your jurisdiction without starting all over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5544)|
| 1:32:29| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5549)|
| 1:32:30| And as a result of this process, we have a relatively short list of people who have been active in it throughout the entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5550)|
| 1:32:38| So we would know who to turn to very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| I see some other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| I think I'm going to make a motion to maybe refer it back to MPC and see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| But I see there are other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Are you waiting to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| Yeah, because I see another light on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| And I don't want to limit the discussion to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| I'm kind of thinking along those same lines, but I didn't know if procedurally it made more sense to have a clean break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| and turn it down so it begins at MPC because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| we don't need to get back into regurgitating the same things that it apparently has become known to us that are suspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5591)|
| 1:33:21| where it makes sense that, you know, Vice Mayor Brown is talking about getting some folks together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| Mr. Donaldson is, you know, wholeheartedly agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| And that's a great path to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| But I'm just wondering if it makes sense as well to just pull the plug on the whole thing and begin anew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5616)|
| 1:33:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| If Mr. Swanson wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I think there's a legal difference between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| The legal difference between the two is a motion to re-refer to MPC actually has something before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5633)|
| 1:34:02| If the motion, if this issue fails for lack of a motion, then you really have nothing pending at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5642)|
| 1:34:10| which does not prevent MPC from considering the issue and going forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| But it doesn't legally put the issue back before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| Then it's up to MPC to determine whether or not they want to go forward with further consideration or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| I guess my general thought is a clean slate better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| I'm going to go to Councilman Holquist and we'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I don't think I was next in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Chair's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| Well, I was just going to, in response to what Mr. Swanson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| I think Mr. Donaldson being the executive director of MPC has told us that he's willing to step back in and take this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5687)|
| 1:34:56| So I think he's able to do that in his position and to take the issue back before the MPC and the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5696)|
| 1:35:05| work it through staff, work it through their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Whether we start with a clean slate or not, I don't think we have to worry about it disappearing into the ether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| Just having sat through MPC's discussion of this, it kind of went everywhere, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| And some of you were there for part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| And I think we have both those interested parties on every side of this issue have spent a great deal of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5730)|
| 1:35:40| And we have really volumes of comments and considerations that have been brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| And I feel that council is best served not to start again and have something else that might come to us with concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5747)|
| 1:35:59| that we couldn't deal with, but to go from where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| And I certainly can't say it like Mr. Swanson stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| But for that reason, it appears to me so that Mr. Donaldson has been sitting in with us in all of our discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5765)|
| 1:36:15| both formal and workshop discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| And I think he understands some of the thoughts that council has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| You know, my interest is just in having something before us that can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| And, frankly, I don't feel what's before us can be considered up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| I want to have something that we can actually consider and that I believe to embody the positions that have been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5795)|
| 1:36:45| to us by many of the people who have been involved over a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| And I'm surely no glutton for punishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| And I think this is a punishing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| But as I said earlier, it's just so important that we not make mistakes, which we will regret possibly in years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| And so I think sending it back to MPC for reconsideration, but not beginning again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| certainly makes me feel a lot more comfortable because, frankly, that was just --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| I did not feel that it had been given the thought by all the commissioners that this council has put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5838)|
| 1:37:25| So I would like to send it back for refinement for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| You know, Ms. Peel, I guess I want to agree with what you just said, that the commissioners didn't put the kind of thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| into it that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| And I think it's a mistake at all to send this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| I think that there ought to be a committee that considers it, and it ought to be a city council committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| Well, I felt like we had a really good opportunity for that a few minutes ago, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5868)|
| 1:37:49| Pass that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5869)|
| 1:37:50| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| I think that this is a hard decision and that this council has to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5872)|
| 1:37:56| And I don't think we send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I think that's a way for us to say somebody else make a decision on this, that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| And I think we start fresh by doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| In my suggestion or motion I'm going to make to refer it back, that is with the understanding, and I'll just make the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| that whatever comes out of there comes back to us, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| And it gives us some other information to vet, and ultimately it's going to be our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| It's what I envision happening and not us deferring to MPC and Mark Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| and a few folks to get into a discussion and make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| So I don't want to limit the debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| I see Council Member Rodney's light is on, so I'm not going to make the motion yet because I don't want to limit it to that motion I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| She may want to have a more general comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| Well, I'm going to make the motion that we refer it back to MPC with the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| and the backdrop of all discussions we've had, Mr. Donaldson, about, you know, at least what I would like to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| and that is the convening of a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Obviously, the 30-day time frame is no longer on it and may allow for some real good discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| but for you all to get together and look at this issue in light of all the discussion that has occurred here today and the workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| I'm speaking to Vice Mayor Brown's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| I think the main thing here is that everyone around this table agrees that we need another process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| I think we concur about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| I think where we disagree is what that best process should be, and I just want to weigh in that I feel like referring this back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5969)|
| 1:39:38| We've done that once already, and it's not getting us to where we want to be on this, and I feel like a clean slate option is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5978)|
| 1:39:47| Let's start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Let's stay with the status quo that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| That gives us an unlimited amount of time to look at this in a fresh light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Right now, there's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Any other discussion to the motion, which is to refer it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| We're going to go ahead and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| A motion to refer back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Let's just go ahead and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| It's 6-3, but just to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6020)|
| 1:40:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Councilman Pilo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| Fails 4-5 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Would anybody else like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| If there's not going to be a motion, then nothing's going to be on the floor, and we are going to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| The chair needs to rule, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| I know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| Anybody else want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Let me ask one question now that we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Mr. Swanson, I guess this, with no motion, it's really up to Mr. Donaldson whether he decides he wants to take it back up or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| because it's not before them officially, and we haven't seen it anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| So I guess it's just up to them if they decide they're going to bring it up or someone asks them to look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| Is that kind of where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| I guess just in response to Mr. Brown's question, I think we could ask them to do it, or we could set up a committee to do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| So I think there are a couple options on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| I guess we'll have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| The only thing is the mayor appointed a task force to spend a whole lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| We put a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| We need that technical expertise from MPC and the institutional knowledge of what they've done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| And that was my concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| We can appoint a blue ribbon panel just like the mayor did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| It's another committee going to report back to us, and then we're going to still ask MPC's input and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| So I was trying to get us past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| But whichever way the pleasure of council is, I'll be glad as vice mayor to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| try to get a committee together, whatever you all want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| But hopefully we'll have a continuation of this discussion in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Mr. Donaldson has a very full plate, and I don't know if he will voluntarily step in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| I'll be glad to meet with these folk and continue this discussion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| But I know he has a very full plate, and we're always putting something on it, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| Any comment, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| I'd be happy to join your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Budget's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Of course that's the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| That's the right time of year to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| I was going to say join our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| We didn't say convene a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| 12B is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6164)|

| 1:42:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| You don't want to do this on an emergency, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6185)|

| 1:43:21| for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2008 and ending June 30, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| It might be good to see on the record because I actually received a phone call from a concerned citizen who saw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| and was concerned about what it meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I think it might be good to see on the record and for our viewing audience at home that this is the first vote on these necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| items as it relates to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| We'll have a second voting on this after our council legislative hearings regarding the budget and that while people are hearing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| especially the appropriation fixing the annual tax rate and all that, that has to be approved again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6232)|
| 1:43:58| And this is just part of our process in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| I received a call about that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| And that's true for 12B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Yeah, B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| All those are tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Just to make that statement on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| So maybe, I don't know if anybody else got a call about it, but I got a call when it was on the agenda from someone wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| what that all meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6260)|

| 1:44:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Vice Mayor Brown, we do have one speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| That was an old line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| I'm Ms. Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| And I'd just like to commend the members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| You put your money where your mouth was, and you did what you said you would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| And I'd like to thank the members of the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| We've met many, many times for a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| I've learned in the past one, two, three, four work days that no matter how good it is, you're not going to please everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6312)|
| 1:45:21| You already knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| Well, it's just been reinforced a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| There is, no joke, there is still a lot of education to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| We are beginning to hear some positive comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| Not just myself, but Larry and Dr. Lyons and I have talked, and we are beginning to hear a lot of positive comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6334)|
| 1:45:41| But, and just for the record, so everybody out there can hear this, I'm not getting one red cent in any of the three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6341)|
| 1:45:49| so the report's not been swayed to reflect anything on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| But I did want to take this opportunity to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| We finally were able to answer, were we underpaid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| And finally, we were able to put a benefit, a calculation on our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| So I do want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| Thank you, and thank you for participating on that committee that you referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6368)|
| 1:46:12| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6374)|

| 1:46:51| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| Well, there's a motion to approve on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| Motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| I'm going to second just to keep us moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| Was it seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| Which was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| This was the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6426)|
| 1:47:07| I don't think that was actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| I didn't make a motion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Remember, you just said he was going to, so there's no, he didn't actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Are you going to make a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Well, currently, just for the record, there's a motion and a second for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| Now, I think there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| I'd like to actually postpone this to have a workshop to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| I think this is a great idea to ban parking in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| I'm not sure that we've got an ordinance that is going to be enforced in a way that's going to work for the neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6449)|
| 1:47:34| and I'd like to get some time us talking about how we can better do that because I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| It's important enough for our neighborhoods that we do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| So I'd like to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| I think our next workshop date is the 26th of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| I'd like to postpone this to the next council meeting after that, which is far enough forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6469)|
| 1:47:54| I can't remember the date, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| In the spirit of, the same spirit that I voted to postpone the earlier item, I will join you in seconding that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6476)|
| 1:48:04| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| I agree with Councilman Becker's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| I actually came here with a few questions with regards to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| and I'm actually glad that we're going to postpone it because I do have some questions with regards to whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| it actually addresses adequately parking in front yards and would maybe negatively impact the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| because I think it reaches maybe a little farther than just front yards and side yards if you read it very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| and that's just one of my assessments of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| and I think we may have gone a little outside the scope of the original request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| and I'd love to have a debate about maybe why we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| So I'll join in that motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| Councilman Woodhull, and just for the record, it's July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| It would be that first meeting in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| I'm also glad we're postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| I did want to ask Ms. Poplin if you had any comments about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| There is a potential conflict that we have found in the draft ordinance with the existing regulations that we have in Article 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| Section 7, so that will give us time to work through those conflicts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| Ms. Feeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| Well, I would just comment that a number of people are very interested in seeing something of this nature be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6552)|
| 1:49:21| However, there's some questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| and I know there's some neighborhood groups that are meeting and giving some consideration to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| So I just think it's going to make it easier for us to work with to allow some time for those discussions to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Is there anybody in the audience that keeps standing up and sitting down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| Ms. Doka, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Holly Doka and 4804 Tamachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| I'm President of COIN, the Council of Involved Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| and we would like to suggest a postponement also so we can have a workshop with MPC and KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6594)|
| 1:50:03| and some more neighborhood people and perhaps zoning just so we can review this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| and make sure we get the best ordinance possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| And we note several other members of COIN and other neighborhood groups in the audience as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| The motion is to postpone until July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| Do I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6626)|
| 1:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| 12G is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| Article 1, Section 1, Article 3, Section 4, Article 4, Section 9, Article 5, Section 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6639)|

| 1:50:52| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6652)|
| 1:50:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| Questions here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6658)|
| 1:50:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| 12I is an ordinance approving the request of J. Stephen Reidener for a one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| amendment from low-density residential to light industrial for property located on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| south side of Old Amherst Road, southwest of Amherst Road, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| I'd like to make my comments and address both the motion on the floor, 12I, and the following motion, 12J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| I'm willing to vote for these on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| I have not had a chance to drive out and look at the subject properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| I understand that the subject property is a difficult one, backing up to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6693)|
| 1:51:38| However, I also feel that it's in a sensitive area, surrounded as it is by residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6698)|
| 1:51:45| The staff report indicates that the next item actually addresses the zoning, not the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6705)|
| 1:51:52| But the staff notes in their report that the I-3 zone is a spot zone in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| To rezone the property in question from what it is now to I-3, I think, just continues that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6718)|
| 1:52:07| And I can support industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| Again, I understand that this is a difficult property, and I did tell Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6730)|
| 1:52:14| Reidener this this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| However, the I-1 that was recommended by staff gives another level of protection to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| surrounding neighbors in that there is some review capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| So I'll support this on first reading, but I do have some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I did get out to look at it, and I can support this on first or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| This is very much a spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| It is very residential around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| I'm especially concerned because we had an ordinance rezoning a piece of property out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| Amherst on the other side of Seaver six or eight months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| And it was a real clear sense then that we were going to zone those properties facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| Amherst until Seaver, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| And this is well past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| So I think we've made a decision that this shouldn't be zoned industrial, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6776)|
| 1:53:02| want to encourage an industrial growth in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| So I can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| Vice Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| I was just going to ask, because I'm not --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| Councilman Becker has been out there, and I, like Councilmember Roddy, have not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| But is this out there near the Gouffin Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| Remember the very first issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| It was maybe January of our first year on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Is this very close to that same area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6809)|
| 1:53:30| Well, it's in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| But it's actually you may be familiar with Amherst Grocery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| They're on the little where Amherst cuts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| Old Amherst cuts off and goes down there by Amherst Grocery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| It's right there in that little strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| So it's out in that general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| I remember we had a big discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Well, it's a quarter of a mile, half a mile from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Where that Gouffin was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| I think that was one of the first little things we dealt with on council way back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| Considering the staff recommendation at MPC and what all has been discussed and what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| considered at MPC, if Mr. Hall would consider a friendly amendment for that light industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6846)|
| 1:54:13| and later I-1 designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| I'd like to hear from him on his thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| My name is Steve Ridenour and I live at 2209 Houser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| Mayor Haslam and council members, I appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| We own a piece of property right now that is five acres that is zoned I-3 and has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6873)|
| 1:54:41| And all the property that does abut with Amherst Road all the way through the city to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6881)|
| 1:54:47| line is all I-3 or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| There are no other zonings on Amherst Road if you look at your maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| Even beyond the city line, industrial zoning goes all the way to the new shod road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6894)|
| 1:55:00| So there's not a situation where there is an unusual spot zoning because I've got a map here that shows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6900)|
| 1:55:08| buildings very close to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| The zonings of industrial are all the way through the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| There is no I-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| There is no I-1 that adjoins Amherst Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| But the reason we're here is a lady lost her husband and she wanted to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6921)|
| 1:55:28| And we purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| And when we told the surveyor, the engineer, to get a one lot subdivision, he suggested for the government's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6931)|
| 1:55:38| simplicity of NPC and the recording that it would be wise to get one zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| So we went ahead and before doing a one lot subdivision, we asked for the same zoning that we now currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6945)|
| 1:55:53| But together the two partials are 7.2 acres and we have almost five now that's zoned I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| So it is just an extension of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| One of the things I want to bring up that NPC said was they didn't realize at first, and you'll see it in your notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6964)|
| 1:56:13| the I-3 zoning has larger setbacks than I-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| And that was brought up by some of the NPC members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| But the setbacks are 10 foot more in I-3 on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6980)|
| 1:56:24| They're 25 foot more on the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| So as far as buffers from the neighborhood, there would be more space between the possibility of building a building in I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6987)|
| 1:56:35| But we certainly appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| And the council member, Ms. Roddy, is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| There is a railroad that goes down one side of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| And really without this type of use, the property would definitely be a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| There wouldn't be a future use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| I'm going to go to Councilman Bailey and then I'll come back to you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| I think you might have a question, but we'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| I missed a little bit of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| And what is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| And this is in your district, Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7027)|
| 1:57:08| And you make the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7028)|
| 1:57:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| You support this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7033)|
| 1:57:14| I haven't heard from anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| We applied for this very early, probably two or three months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| We have never had opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| We did not have any opposition at NPC, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| We have never had opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| As a matter of fact, the neighbors, you know, have never opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7049)|
| 1:57:30| I heard a little bit of a comment that this is inconsistent with the I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7050)|
| 1:57:33| And then I hear you say it is consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| Mr. Donaldson, what's your opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7056)|
| 1:57:40| Well, I can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| There's an existing parcel that's zoned I-3 that could be categorized as spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7062)|
| 1:57:49| It's actually a remnant of a strip zoning that occurred many decades ago along the railroads within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7069)|
| 1:57:59| And the subject property that we're talking about tonight is next to that existing I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7079)|
| 1:58:05| So the purpose is to expand the industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| Staff recommended the zone I-1, which is kind of a transitional zone district from the heavier industrial to a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7090)|
| 1:58:22| That's the purpose for that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| The planning commission had a problem with creating a development piece that would have two different zone districts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7105)|
| 1:58:34| So they recommended the I-3 consistent with the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| Councilman Hulquist, I will come back to you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| Well, going back to Councilman Becker's comments earlier, I share his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| This creeping spot zoning, just because there's a railroad there, I think in the past it might have been assumed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7131)|
| 1:59:00| property along a railroad line might eventually develop as industrial because of the potential for sidings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| We typically don't see that kind of railroad service for a lot of these properties anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| Most of the industrial properties are serviced by trucks and not by railroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| And these are not particularly great truck roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| And just because a mistake, if you will, I mean, depending on how you see it, how you categorize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7159)|
| 1:59:28| just because it was spot zoned in the past, which may have been a mistake based on what our policy should be to avoid spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7168)|
| 1:59:35| doesn't mean we have to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| On the other hand, the question is what's really a viable alternative here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| Should it remain R1 or should it move on to something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| And if you go back to staff's recommendation, can they accomplish what they want to do in an I-1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7189)|
| 1:59:57| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Add the additional protection of a use-on-review being required to go through the I-1 process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7200)|
| 2:00:07| I'd be interested to hear what Councilman Becker thinks about the alternative of an I-1 zone and the use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7207)|
| 2:00:14| Mr. Becker, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7214)|
| 2:00:15| Mr. Redner, I'm kind of offended for you standing up there and saying that this is an extension of an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7215)|
| 2:00:22| None of the I-3 property is adjoined by industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| It's all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| None of the properties adjacent to the residential properties that adjoin your I-3 are even industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7226)|
| 2:00:32| It's a long way to the industrial things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| So it concerns me that you're going to – and you don't get to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| I'm not asking you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7237)|
| 2:00:38| I'm making a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| It concerns me that you'll stand up and say this should be industrial because it's just an extension of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| That's – it's not that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| And that bothers me that you'll say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| The railroad is on the other side of the road from you, so you don't even abut the railroad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| And I don't – just extending industrial zones to say we made a mistake 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| and we have to expand it now doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| So I can't support this, and I'm a little bothered by your attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| I think we try and debate the truth here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| In consideration of the debate tonight, I just – I don't think I can support this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| I really am concerned about the staff report that this is spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| I could support the next item if it were I-1, but I can't support the I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7284)|
| 2:01:35| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7295)|
| 2:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| Mr. Eidenhower, I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7297)|
| 2:01:38| Can you live with I-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| I mean, you've heard there's some strenuous objection by at least a few people about I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| The problem that the engineers have come up – I obviously didn't mean to offend anyone in this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7308)|
| 2:01:54| but the problem that the engineers have come up with and MPC theirself was having two different zonings on such a small partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| It's only 7.2 acres, and they didn't – they mentioned, which would you go by the setbacks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| We can build the building on the part that's zoned I-3, and we can put the parking lot on the part that's zoned I-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| And the parking lot can go through review, but it seemed to be more reasonable with our engineers and designers that there be one consistent zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7336)|
| 2:02:27| And I think at the MPC meeting, the MPC commissioners agreed that having two zonings on a small partial wouldn't be the thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7347)|
| 2:02:37| When I see Amherst Road and I see industrial properties that are adjoining it, they are I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7357)|
| 2:02:45| If you look on your map, they're all I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| Now, there is residential all through the Middlebrook Pike area that backs up to industrial three zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| It happens over hundreds of acres there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| So as far as my property or this property being long distance from I-3, that's simply not the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7377)|
| 2:03:07| Mr. Donaldson, what can you do in I-3 that you can't do in I-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7387)|
| 2:03:15| Well, they do have different lists, but the I-1 captures most of the current industrial and warehousing uses that are being developed these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7395)|
| 2:03:27| I mean, I-3 is a more expansive use of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| Yeah, it's our heaviest, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| It's our general industrial district as opposed to I-1 being a planned industrial park zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7414)|
| 2:03:42| Okay, so an I-1, as they go through that process, they have to come back with MPC and work with them because it's a planned matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7422)|
| 2:03:52| versus I-3, is that the C-4 of industrial zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| That's a good analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Yeah, you go get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| I heard Becker and Roddy as no with their other no's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| I heard six ayes and three no's on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| But actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| I'm just saying on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| 12J is an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side of Old Hamhurst Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| southwest of Amherst Road, from R-1 Low Density Residential District to I-3 General Industrial District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| J. Stephen Ridenour, applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7480)|
| 2:04:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| May I ask Mr. Ridenour again, and I'm sorry if I wasn't clearly paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| Did you say that you could accept an amendment to this ordinance to change it to I-1, or do you feel like you need I-3 to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| Once you make this a one-lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Ms. Roddy, two-thirds of our property is I-3, and we will need I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7499)|
| 2:05:04| The one big difference, and I hope NPC will agree with me on this, is I-1 allows 30% coverage, and I-3 allows 80% coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7504)|
| 2:05:15| So there is a major difference there in the size building that you can build, and it wouldn't work in our situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7515)|
| 2:05:22| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| What do you plan on putting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| It will be industrial buildings for distribution logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Mr. Donaldson, is what he said accurate about the percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7537)|
| 2:05:43| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| I-3 has a maximum lot coverage of 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| I-1, which is designed to be an industrial park, has a maximum lot coverage of 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7549)|
| 2:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| I heard the same three no's on the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7565)|

| 2:09:58| First is Mr. Boyce McCall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| Mr. McCall here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7805)|

| 2:10:34| You give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| Larry Wilson, 1806 Fordtown Road, Jonesboro, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| My name is Larry Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| I own Advanced Alarm Systems and I'm licensed by the Tennessee Alarm Contractors Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7843)|
| 2:10:52| License certification number C-0132.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| Classifications in fire, burglary, and closed circuit television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| I've been in business of providing protection for life and properties for over 20 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| I graduated from UT in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Arts Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7868)|
| 2:11:16| And I've taught in the public school system and in the security industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7876)|
| 2:11:24| First, what I want to do here is I want to give all honor and glory to God, our Creator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| and thank him for the liberties he has granted us within our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| And I appreciate, y'all, the way you start your meetings and all and the pledge to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| I'd also like to thank you for the opportunity to present my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| The problems that I've gotten into in the city of Knoxville I want to bring your attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| My rights as a licensed fire alarm contractor to do fire alarm systems in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| have been taken away by what I believe is misinterpretations of the fire alarm code in FPA 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7918)|
| 2:12:05| This code is a guideline for the installations, testings, and maintenance of fire alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7925)|
| 2:12:11| In my opinion, it's not meant to conflict with any state or local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7931)|
| 2:12:17| It also has this on the book, on the cover of the book, it states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7937)|
| 2:12:27| What I believe the problem here is that it was decided by only a few city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| to have a private, out-of-state, for-profit company certifying fire alarm jobs in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7953)|
| 2:12:41| This matter should have gone before the city council and you should have had an input on all those being affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7961)|
| 2:12:51| These misinterpretations of NFPA 72 have caused astronomical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| The certification process could have been done by others within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| Not many of the licensed alarm contractors, now many, excuse me, licensed alarm contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7983)|
| 2:13:12| are barred from doing fire alarm systems in the city of Knoxville unless they initially pay approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| $5,000 up front, I guess, pay annual inspection fees per alarm account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=7999)|
| 2:13:28| and $3,000 annually to this private, out-of-state company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| This puts undue burdens on small companies and limits competition by allowing only a few member companies to skyrocket their prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8012)|
| 2:13:40| It's been reported to me that some are charging as high as 600% more since this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| These costs are being passed on to those required to have fire alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8026)|
| 2:13:51| Of course, that could be taxpayers and even the city building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| As you can see, this not only affects small alarm system contractors, but hundreds of people requiring to have fire alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| such as small businesses, daycare facilities, churches, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| If this problem is not addressed now, many will not be able to bear this exorbitant cost being forced upon them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8048)|
| 2:14:16| and thus have no choice but to close their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8056)|
| 2:14:22| One more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| And one of my – what I think the solution to solve this problem is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| allow the state-licensed alarm contractors with fire certification to continue to install, maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| and monitor fire alarm systems that meet code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8077)|
| 2:14:40| Let the city of Knoxville fire inspectors, like everywhere else in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| verify that the alarm jobs meet proper code by inspecting and testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Fire inspectors can be second- and third-party verification, as in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| Alternate certification processes could be performed by state and local licensed electrical contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| And the problem re-addressed again, an NFPA guideline is not a tool to monopolize the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| My rights and liberties as a state-licensed fire alarm contractor have been taken away in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| Competition has been limited to a select few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| Many taxpayers' small businesses have already been affected, and many more will be put out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| And the solution is you –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8122)|
| 2:15:24| One more second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8124)|
| 2:15:25| – brought to the city council members have the ability to stop this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| and correct the misinterpretation of the fire code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8128)|
| 2:15:31| And Article 1, Section 1 of the Tennessee Constitution, the power should be in the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8131)|
| 2:15:37| And you, the city council, you have the right to reform the government as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8137)|
| 2:15:42| Please reform this problem in order to help protect and serve the people without undue constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8142)|
| 2:15:48| And once again, I want to thank you for the opportunity to bring this problem before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8148)|
| 2:15:54| Thank you, Mr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8154)|
| 2:15:55| Thank you for taking time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| Larry Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Before we move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Mr. Wilson, I think there might be a question for you if you want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8161)|
| 2:16:05| Well, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| Or maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Are you familiar with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| And if so, can you get back to council with a report on the status or something, a written report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| or give us some information that we could kind of process in comparison to what we have before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8176)|
| 2:16:22| I have not talked to Mr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| I have received e-mails from Mr. Ross, and I forwarded them on to the fire marshal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| And he has been in correspondence with Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| And I think he may be the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8197)|
| 2:16:38| I did attend a meeting back in October with two other contractors, and he was not in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| The fire marshal was, and I think he's here now if you have any questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8205)|
| 2:16:51| Roger Byrd, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8211)|
| 2:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| Well, maybe that's the place to direct questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| If Mr. Ross is going to speak to this, I'll wait with any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8215)|
| 2:16:59| Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8219)|
| 2:17:00| If you could start with giving us your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| Larry M. Ross, 1543 Nicholson Schoolhouse Road, Columbia, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| I'm not very good at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| I haven't done this very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| So if you don't mind, I'll just read straight through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| Interrupt me if you feel like you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| No one objects to the tenet that fire alarm systems should be functional and reliable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| Constant improvement in systems and procedures obviously can cause significant cost to both consumers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8247)|
| 2:17:33| and alarm installation companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| Therefore, changes in codes and practices should always take this into account when the rules are changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8256)|
| 2:17:41| No codes or rule changes should be adopted that do not contain the input of everyone that is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8261)|
| 2:17:47| The authority of fire marshals to enforce various fire recommendations is well accepted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8267)|
| 2:17:51| and proper if done in the spirit of cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| It is unacceptable for any government official to dictate that a citizen do this in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| to make the official's job easier or a business do that in order to remain in business without regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| to the cost to comply both financial and social.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| The ability to dictate to citizenry is called rule by decree and should be reserved for emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8289)|
| 2:18:15| and never to relieve everyday or mundane problems that have other solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| What happened in Knoxville, possibly without the city council knowing, were decrees issued by former fire chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| and fire marshals that increased the cost of fire alarm systems for consumers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| put small alarm companies already in the fire alarm business out of the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| and created city-sponsored revenue for underwriters' laboratories, an out-of-state corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8315)|
| 2:18:41| and I might add a monopoly in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| Alarm contractors were given only 90 days to become UL listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| No one with experience was grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| Works in progress were canceled and mechanisms put in place to take existing clients away from companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8332)|
| 2:18:58| not signing up with UL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Consumers must now pay more for the same fire alarms because there are fewer companies to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| UL costs must be passed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| Small companies were forced out of the business because it's not cost effective to pay UL approximately $3,000 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8349)|
| 2:19:16| inspection and yearly fees to sell three or four fire alarms per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| Mechanisms were decreed that take away small companies' existing customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| This is the one I object to the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| This interferes with contracts, intellectual property, chattel, and quite possibly social relationships the alarm company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| owners have formed over the years with their customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| All of these effects rise to the level of city council hearing that should not be put in place merely because a city employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| decreed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| Separation of a company from its contractual property requires due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8386)|
| 2:19:52| When myself, Larry Wilson, and John Knox interviewed the fire marshal discussion on October 12, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8392)|
| 2:19:59| to discuss why the Knoxville decreed without being able to cite an ordinance that all fire alarm companies be UL,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| we were not told that it was because of shoddy fire alarms being installed by any company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| Instead, their reasoning was based on solving common problems all fire departments have, such as false alarms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8410)|
| 2:20:17| better key holder response to the scene, better ongoing inspection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| and they did not like distant monitoring centers, although this is unavoidable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| The dictate that every fire alarm company be UL listed was merely one large band-aid applied without regard to the collateral damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8426)|
| 2:20:33| There are other ways to solve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| It is the opinion of myself and hundreds of my colleagues that we're already authorized by the state of Tennessee to do fire alarms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| and further state law says that no city, county, or municipality may make additional certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| or regulations upon alarm companies regulated by the Tennessee Alarm Contractors Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| One more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Say again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| One more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| This has been a fix since the early 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Even though the current codes mention listed this, certified that, they rarely mention UL directly, and that connection is rather vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8460)|
| 2:21:08| I'm skipping ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8468)|
| 2:21:15| Yep, let's go ahead to this page right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8475)|
| 2:21:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| Got nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| There is a disclaimer in the NFPA publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8488)|
| 2:21:30| This says that codes recommendation therein are not to be used where they conflict with state or local laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8490)|
| 2:21:37| Unfortunately, the current fire codes do not differentiate between metropolitan and rural areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| nor do the codes consider the geographical population of qualified fire alarm companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| In this regard, the codes are flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| In order to prevent consistent, inconsistent conflicting rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| we feel like the qualifications for fire alarm companies should be set at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8514)|
| 2:21:59| Now, this is the part that I wrote this morning, and since we have fire department officials here, I'd like to get this part through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8519)|
| 2:22:07| I have just this morning been in communication with Knoxville Fire Department personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| and there seems to be a possibility of resolving this matter without sponsoring a monopoly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| and providing nearly everything the fire department desires, possibly more, without conflicting with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8535)|
| 2:22:22| The Knoxville City Council may be called upon to validate certain measures which will then have the effect of code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| yet be tuned to local needs and arising from the democratic process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| I sincerely appreciate the open discourse and willingness to listen to alternative ideas provided by the Knoxville Fire Department personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8552)|
| 2:22:41| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8561)|
| 2:22:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8564)|
| 2:22:45| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Mr. Ross, if you could provide a copy of your prepared comments tonight to our city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8566)|
| 2:22:51| she could distribute that to the other members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| I have nine more copies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| She already has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| Roger Byrd, would you mind coming down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| I'm not expecting to get a full response or a full resolution of this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| but just to begin to get a feel for what you have to say about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| and I realize this is probably going to be an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8591)|
| 2:23:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| We met in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| We had a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| We did have some shoddy work going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| We had some fire alarm systems that were not code compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8604)|
| 2:23:28| We had some contractors that were lowballing at the start of a bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8608)|
| 2:23:35| and at the end they would blame us with causing a big expense at the end of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8615)|
| 2:23:42| whenever they had lowballed the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| We were having a lot of false alarms and some maintenance issues with present fire alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| So we got together and looked at NFPA 72| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| and looked at all the discretionary parts in it, the shalls and shoulds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8634)|
| 2:23:59| and what it allowed us to do as a municipality through that code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| We met with fire alarm contractors from all over Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8645)|
| 2:24:13| everywhere that we could take and send out an invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8653)|
| 2:24:16| We met at the convention center and we went through this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8656)|
| 2:24:23| We did not say that you had to be UL certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| We did not say you had to be FM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| We invited everybody to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| The code does allow for requiring a company to be listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8672)|
| 2:24:39| for the central station to be listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| and that is the route we chose to try to solve some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| The results of being the certification process has given us better work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8686)|
| 2:24:54| It has given us better fire alarm systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| Most of the contractors that I have talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| they like the process because it does put them in a better light by putting in a better system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8700)|
| 2:25:07| Their feet are held to the fire a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| So that is basically how we have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| Mr. Ross and a couple of others met with us last October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| They expressed their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| We asked them to take and get back to us with a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| Never got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080506?start=8726)|
