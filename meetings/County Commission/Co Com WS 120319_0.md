| 0:00:08| We want to say thank you to the folks here at the town of Farragut for hosting us here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=8)|
| 0:00:11| today, Mayor McGill and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=11)|
| 0:00:13| They've been working with our staff to make sure that things have gone smoothly and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=13)|
| 0:00:17| have and we appreciated the luncheon today where we had an opportunity to talk with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=17)|
| 0:00:21| principals of the Farragut area schools and also representatives from the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=21)|
| 0:00:26| So we have a very good partnership and we're just pleased to be here and thank you again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| to the folks at Farragut for hosting us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| Clerk, if you would call the roll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Boyles, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| Commissioner Norman, Commissioner Ombi, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=39)|
| 0:00:41| Commissioner Briggs, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Commissioner Anders, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| Commissioner Smith, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Commissioner Wright, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Commissioner Brown, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=45)|
| 0:00:46| Commissioner Hammond, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| Commissioner Schell, here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| We have six members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| We have six members present, that is a quorum and so we will proceed with our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=50)|
| 0:00:57| First we have amendments to the agenda and commissioners I would like to in no particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| order item number 25 has been tabled to September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| It is on the agenda but that will be tabled until September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| Also item number 22 with regards to sending a letter to the governor about the investigative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=74)|
| 0:01:24| file regarding Judge Baumgartner, I've talked with our law director and I'd like to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=84)|
| 0:01:30| and just pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| There has been some litigation with regards to that so I'm going to ask that that be pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| for the time being until we have a chance to research it some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Also with regards to the agenda, item number three, the resolution regarding the unexpired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=101)|
| 0:01:50| term of the Knox County Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| In consultation with our legal officials, Mr. Jarrett had issued a letter of resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=113)|
| 0:02:01| He has withdrawn that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| That letter was never acted upon by this body so it was never formally approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| And so he has withdrawn his letter of resignation and it is my understanding that because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| has withdrawn that letter and this body did not take any action on it, that Mr. Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| will continue as our law director until August the 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| We have had an individual who has asked to speak on this so he, okay so you don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| to speak on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Does any commissioner have any question about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| If not, then we will withdraw item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| Okay, yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| If you give us your name and address of the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| And I was unaware, I mean I was aware that Mr. Jarrett had made an attempt to resign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| and then to unresign and I wasn't aware that all this had gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| I was simply going to request that the commission and Mr. Jarrett, I guess now if you've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=179)|
| 0:03:10| a determination that he's going to continue as the law director, that Mr. Armstrong be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| included in the loop in making some of these decisions, especially with regard to, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| know, if there's an appointment of a special counsel to help the Charter Review Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=203)|
| 0:03:30| And the reason, and where I'm coming from is, I didn't even vote in this, I'm embarrassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| to say I didn't even vote in this last election, shame on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| But I became somewhat interested in it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| Mr. Armstrong asked me if I would help in some regards with this transition and I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| to ask a number of questions before I did it, but I did agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| I think his heart is in the right place and he's trying to do the right thing, but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| would hope that this commission and Mr. Jarrett when it comes to this Charter Review would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| involve Mr. Armstrong since he was elected by the people to have his input into some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=244)|
| 0:04:11| of the important issues that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| And I believe that that is Mr. Jarrett's intent, is it not, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| If I could, members of the commission, and sir, in a memorandum I sent to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| the last paragraph culminates as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| I have a vacant office in my office that I plan to offer a GOP primary winner, Burt Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=266)|
| 0:04:31| for his use at his convenience over the next several months so that he can become familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| with the day-to-day affairs of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Now, of course, this is excluding attorney-client privilege, which I cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| Also, this would ensure a seamless transition provided, of course, he is elected in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| but that is exactly my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| I have already made that offer once asking him to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| I will actually have a physical office for him to come in and I plan on making no long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| changes to the office without consulting with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| And again, if it's a matter of attorney-client privilege by the rules of professional conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| those I won't debate with him, but other than that, in terms of the issues involving with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| the Charter Review Committee, that was my intent of resigning in the first place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| involve him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| Yes, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Mr. Chairman, what about, you know, we started to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| What happens there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| We've had people that submitted applications and what happens there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| Well, when we took those applications, it was with the understanding that there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| be a vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| Since Mr. Jarrett has withdrawn his resignation and we never formally acted on it, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| no vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Joe, have you talked to Mr. Armstrong yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| I have sent him a letter and asked him to contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| I did talk to Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| I did not reach Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Mr. Buehler did say that he applauded the decision for me to stay on and that he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| of course, withdrawing his name to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| But again, my concern is researching this, looking at the case law, the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| and CTAS opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| You'd actually be putting yourself in jeopardy if you would then try to fulfill a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| that's already been full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| So, you know, it's an inconvenience for Mr. Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| I apologize to him if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| But again, I will – my door is open to Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| I'm hoping – my whole intent was to get him involved immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| But for his personal reasons, he wants to wait and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| But I, again, encourage him to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| He has an open door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| We're not going to have this kind of acrimony that was between John Owings and Bill Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| I want to tolerate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| So I want the complete opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Well, I'll just, you know – because you're going to be out this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Just two days to handle some issues from my mother who has end-stage Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| But I'm around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And again, he's certainly welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| He has my cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| He has my work phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| And he knows where my office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I'd just like to see you guys get in touch with each other if we can, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| I think it's essential, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Yes, Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I've got two resolutions to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| 101 and 114.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| So do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added and delete what needs to be deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=426)|
| 0:07:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Yes, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| And in the interim, I would remove number two – or number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=439)|
| 0:07:28| So we would ask that number three be withdrawn or removed from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Martha Buchanan, Director of Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| I have a contract between the state of Tennessee and Knox County for TB services, an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| to our current contract that needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| You said TB services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| That's tuberculosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| Yes, tuberculosis services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| I'm watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| If they said TB, I wanted to make sure they were interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Again, these microphones are – I see red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| That's why I'm asking if anybody has anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Yes, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Commissioner Broyes, did you include the resolution relative to the appointment of Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=481)|
| 0:08:06| Owen Bee to the Charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| You included that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| And I have discussed that with Commissioner Owen Bee, and he certainly concurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Also, Commissioners, number six, I would encourage the Commission not to pass this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| or even consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| The problem is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| The Charter is clear that you must have a Commission member from each Commission district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=503)|

| 0:08:31| By replacing Commissioner Norman with someone who does not live in that district and who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| is not a Commissioner could put this entire process in jeopardy and could leave it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| legal attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| That being the case, unfortunately, Commissioner Norman must serve on this committee and cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| be replaced by the Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| So we would ask that number six be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Joe, you're going to be the one telling that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| You're going to be the one telling that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I gave him your cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| So the motion is to delete what needs to be deleted, add what needs to be added, and remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| what needs to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Our agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| First, oh, I do have a proposed consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=551)|

| 0:09:40| 18, 20, and 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=580)|
| 0:09:49| Anyone like any of those removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Before we vote on this per our agreement with the schools, we have two items on education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| This is the time to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Does any Commissioner have any questions of the schools with regards to education consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| none do I hear a motion that we approve the consent agenda. So moved. And motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| is made and seconded. All those in favor say aye. Aye. They are approved. So clerk our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| first item. First item is on page item 4 resolution 111. It's approving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| appointment of Randy Smith to the Knox County Charter Review Committee. Make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| motion we move without recommendation. Is there a second? Second. All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| favor say aye. Aye. It is approved. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| The next item is on page 4. It's item number 19 resolution 804 extending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| billboard moratorium for an additional six months expiring September 30th 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=648)|
| 0:10:56| Let's take that one. Yes. Is this basketball hall of fame has it been deferred? Yes well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| it was to be deferred at the request of the sponsor yes. Okay. Yeah this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| motion to move this to the to September. Yes. Agenda on this. Well I was already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| it's noted on here I'll just make sure we're moving. Okay. Now that the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| one is not the basketball hall of fame it was the September was the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| Yes we're all out of 19 and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| So Mr. Jarrett this was. Just to remind everyone is what we've done is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| that we did have a resolution to ban billboards and digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| regular billboards electronic mission centers permanently such as the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Knoxville's done and we've had a more moratorium that goes back I believe to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| 2008 and what this does this extends that moratorium up until we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| deliberate on the permanent ban. For those watching we had this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| at our chairman's lunch last month the members of the billboard industry were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| there I think we all agreed that we were going to hold public hearings on this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| the fall and so this this is reflective of that. That's that is correct. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Commissioner. Yeah yeah that's that's that's correct and that was with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| concurrence of the billboard industry and the anti billboard people. But in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| meantime this protects you regardless of what you do you may decide to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| no changes you may make a modification but until that time the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| protected from a proliferation of new billboards. And so I've moved to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| this resolution. For a second. Any discussion? All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| It is approved. Next item. Item is number 21 resolution 902 it's establishing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| four-year payment in lieu of tax program for a proposed office and distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=765)|

| 0:12:55| a motion. I make a motion to approve. Is there a second? Second. Any discussion? You want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| address this Todd if you give us your name and address of the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=780)|

| 0:13:15| before you is a can you hear me? Okay. Have before you is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=795)|

| 0:13:39| commercial residential food service equipment company and then your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| package is a good overview from FETA magazine about what it is they do. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| Bible will be here next Monday and be able to address any additional questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| about her company but they're currently located in about 26,000 square feet in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Russellville Tennessee which is adjacent to Morristown on the east side and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| they're at capacity. Matter of fact there's so much capacity they can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| continue to grow. One of the management team was at the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| meeting last week and said that they would hire 15 people immediately if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| had anywhere to put them but they do not. So they've got a growth strategy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| one of which is you know to get in the larger facility but they need access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| a greater workforce. They're planning on hiring considerable number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| employees over the next three to four years and they need a larger pool with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| large skill base such as in Knox County but obviously they don't want to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| all over so they have to be in a location that's close enough they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| existing to be able to maintain a certain number of their employees but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| then reach into that Knox County market. So branding is a big part of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| strategy. There's about 95,000 cars a day that travel I-40 in East Knox County so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| being able to to have their their building on the interstate there is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| of that growth strategy and that's why they came to the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| inquired about the property that we own at least a piece of it between Thorngrove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Pike and I-40. So they currently employ about 63 people they project going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| within the next three to four years 135 people within their company. Anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=917)|
| 0:15:25| investment in the initial phase which would include a 40,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| warehouse 15,000 square foot office headquarters addition on the front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| that that would be about 6.2 million dollars with an anticipated operational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| date of February 2013. So on March 1st the Development Corporation approved a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| sales agreement with them to sell them about 22 acres with an option on another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| 11 on the subject property I talked about but it's really important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| understand that this is this is not the only site that the company has. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| they're smart and they know there's a lot of things to go through so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| looking at other options. There's a site in Sevier County and Sevierville at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| exit 407 that's certainly being considered. I know Sevier County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| certainly offering some incentives for them to locate there and there's also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| site in Hamlin County. So it's really important that we show them as community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| that we want this company. We believe it's a good company for Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| when I say we I mean collectively the Community Development Corp the IDB and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| you as the elected officials that representing the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| So there's gonna be significant amount of cost involved in starting up a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| company and in this particular site it's not an established business part so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| going to take you know some some help to do that. So this pilot tax abatement is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| necessary part of being able to recruit them to Knox County and this is a now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| this is not you know people I think get confused about what pilots are. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| taking money out of the Treasury. It's not even for going tax that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| already collecting. It is for going potential new taxes and I can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| these potential new taxes aren't going to happen without this pilots companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| aren't going to come here. So it's not a but I tell you what will you know so in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| four years when it goes away if we can do all this we know that those taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| property tax will be here but if we don't they're going to be the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| they are now zero. So under the existing IDB's policies and procedures for what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| called the property tax incentive program this project scored out for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| three-year pilot. They're asking for one additional year to help make this these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| numbers work for them and some other facts that were involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| decision was you know this is that we're competing for this project we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| make this project attractive or not as attractive as possible. That this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| site that's going to require additional development work than it would if it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| like in Westbridge. That the subject property currently producing no property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| tax I said before and without this project it's like it will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| produce little to no property taxes in four years and with a four-year abatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| it's estimated that during that time just other taxes generated from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| construction operational employee spending will be nine hundred sixty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| five thousand dollars. So and then I think the most important thing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| this project would create over a hundred new jobs in Knox County. So in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| agenda package one thing you received is economic impact to this project have for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Knox County. Just based on phase one the value of forgone tax would be about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| hundred ninety eight thousand. However as I mentioned before it's still going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| generate at least about nine hundred sixty five thousand in Knox County. Without the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| pilot project doesn't happen and there's no generation four years or nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| hundred sixty five thousand during the pilot period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Questions? Yes Commissioner Smith. Todd in your in your line of business with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| doing this and going out you've got competition trying to keep her here. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| somebody from another county came and said hey I've got something a warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| ready they can move in today. With what you all have done have you locked her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| does this lock her in that she can't take a sweet deal from somebody else? No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| it doesn't. So we've got a lot of hurdles left to go there's still the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| issue that has to go for planning commission in April and then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| come to County Commission in May. But I would say this without the pilot there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| a lot of things that have to happen. She's indicated me this is a preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| site but she's a smart business person and you never you know go into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| situation where that's the only deal you've got. So you know the 407 exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| there's there's a facility there that you know they're seriously looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| there's been several articles in the new sentinel in the mountain press about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| that and then a site in Hamblin County. I went up it was a Friday that we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| yes went up there Friday with the commissioners and you know I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| impressed with her and Todd you did a good job and you know it's I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| something we'd like to see. Any other questions Commissioner Andrews? No I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| I think it's it's real important I think sitting on the Industrial Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| Board or the Development Corporation Board you get to get to see a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| I think it's important that as we talk about this Monday I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| that we look at this pilot if you if you want to approve it approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| pending their rezoning and not wait on the rezoning to to come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| because that could set us back a couple of months. I think it's important that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| we're if we're going to approve it we need to approve it quickly if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Commissioner Brawls. Yes how has the community responded to this have they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1247)|
| 0:20:56| been involved in any of this? Is there anyone here from the community who wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| to speak because I know in the past when we tried to do something in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| area there was a great deal of community concern so I would hate to see us get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1264)|
| 0:21:13| that point again so I'd like to know what steps have been made to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| to the community and if there's anyone here who'd like to speak. The company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| there's if they haven't they're making some efforts to reach out to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| community leaders there but this is not a Development Corporation driven project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| so you know based on the business park and some of the misconceptions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| that this is a single-purpose project you know they're taking the lead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| We have anyone else that like to speak? Yes. Name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| please. I'm Bob Wolfenbarger and I'm speaking for the Eighth District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| Preservation Association my address is 8416 Kodak Road Knoxville Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| 37914. I'd hoped to have a little preparation time before this was heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| so I'll be reading my notes and hopefully we can discuss our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| after. First of all the Thorn Grove community believes we are justified in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| defending our community and all Knox County taxpayers from misguided and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| unnecessary waste of our very limited natural and monetary resources. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| proposed development will have undisclosed consequences and cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Knox County residents and taxpayers. We believe with certainty that any intense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| development of the sinkhole riddled area of surrounding Midway Road interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| will eventually pollute the adjacent groundwater and subsequently require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| Knox County to finance and build a new very expensive waste treatment facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| on the French Broad River to remedy the groundwater catastrophe and add to more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| pollution of Knoxville and Knox County's primary water supply. Second we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| analyzed the numbers as they relate to the new K-Town proposal. We believe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| deal is physically irresponsible. In a time of Wall Street bailouts we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| the numbers reflect pure corporate welfare and no return on investment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| the Knox County taxpayer. The analysis shows that TDC has spent an average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| almost 47,000 an acre to purchase the property. This proposal to sell it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| $18,000 per acre if you don't include the TIF and to sell it for $8,000 an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| if you do include the TIF. Ms. Bible stated that she has 62 existing employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| and that at least 75% of them are from Hamblin and Jefferson counties. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| 25% reside in Sevier County and Knox County. That is why she wants to be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| Midway Road instead of a more suitable location further west because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| close enough so that people living in Jefferson and Sevier and Hamblin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| counties can drive at their jobs in Knox County. How does transplanting primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| Jefferson County, Hamblin County, Sevier County employees from an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| facility in Hamblin County to a greenfield just down the interstate in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Knox County which is one one mile down from the interstate one mile down a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| narrow and winding County Road and without the necessary existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| infrastructure for a giveaway price makes sense to Knox County. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| nowhere for these employees to spend their money at Midway Road and so those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| paychecks will go back to Hamblin and Jefferson and Sevier County with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| employees. You have before you a TIF that will give away the property tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| receipts. Again I ask what benefits is there for Knox County taxpayers? We read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| in the paper that Ms. Bible says she thinks she might be able to expand to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| 100 employees over five years. Last week the number has suddenly jumped to 135. By| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| the time it actually comes from Commission before Commission it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| probably be 200. With no accountability or requirement that they either create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| the jobs or the Sweetwater deal is to be revoked why wouldn't they promise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| moon? If County Commission goes forward with this proposal every other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| in Knox County should ask Commission to provide them also with a sweetheart deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| like this. In good faith the community entered into an agreement to try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| create a cohesive plan for the site and I was a member of that to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| together by Mayor Burchett and headed by Gloria Ray. Evidently the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| work for that committee is going to be disregarded and abandoned since Ms. Ray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| is no longer with the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation. It appears that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| Development Corporation has not learned anything since the Midway Road issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| began. In spite of direction from the County Mayor and the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| Commission to involve the community in a meaningful way there has been no contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| with any of us nor any of the organizations in the community. As you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| all may know for 12 years the Thorn Grove community near the Midway Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| interchange at I-40 has been beleaguered and with harassments and intimidation by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| quasi governmental authority figures. These uninvited and unwanted advances by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| those quasi authority figures have repeatedly been rejected by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| community. By their actions these authority figures are threatening to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| pillage our community thereby forever destroying our dignity, character, culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| and rural values. As any community or individual should do when being forced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| against their will to participate in something they believe is illegal we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| have sought relief and justice from the judiciary authorities and the judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| is imminent. This Friday March 23rd 2012 the ongoing lawsuit on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| property will be heard before Chancellor Fansler. We would suggest that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| be prudent for Commission to wait until the lawsuit has been heard before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| proceeding. Further we would ask that if you intend to grant a TIF for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| K-Tom that it not be tied to a specific property. We would welcome K-Tom to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| County but we would we believe there are excuse me but we believe there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| many other properties that would be most more suitable to this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| and would like to ensure that any of the jobs created would actually go to Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| County residents. Given the same circumstances our community would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| each of you what would you do to protect your community home and cultural values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| Thank you for your time. Commissioner Anderson. Yes sir I'd like to with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| seconds Commissioner Olin be with your approval make it without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| instead of approval. Okay so the motion on the floor is sent on without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| recommendation. Did anyone else want to speak with regards to this? Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| questions? Commissioner Briggs your light is on but yeah I know it just pops on. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| the motion on the floor is to send on without recommendation. All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| favor say aye. Any opposition? It is approved. I'd like to welcome Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Dave Wright who has joined us and Commissioner thank you so much for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| here. Thank you Mr. Chairman I can blame this on my dear mother. She is back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1710)|

| 0:28:40| tardiness. Well no no reason to apologize we hope your mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| is going to do well. Also Mayor Tim Burchett is here. I just saw the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1725)|

| 0:30:07| people that came and I would like to afford them the opportunity to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| this matter because some of them may not be able to attend next Monday so if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| could allow them to speak. Sure anyone would like to speak on this please come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1814)|

| 0:30:32| appreciate the opportunity to speak in favor of this resolution regarding TVA's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| tree cutting policy. First I would like to thank Commissioner Olinby for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| sponsoring this resolution and for his leadership on this issue of great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| importance to our community. Many of you may recall that I last spoke before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1843)|

| 0:30:51| resolution regarding KUB's tree policies. Today I urge that Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| consider approving a resolution to send TVA a clear message that it must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| immediately reconsider and revise its current policy which currently requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1860)|

| 0:31:28| private property, reduces property values and harms the environment and wildlife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1888)|

| 0:31:39| the entire TVA service area. TVA has in the past few years adopted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| aggressively enforced a policy which in addition to costing ratepayers hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| of millions of dollars requires the removal of many full-grown trees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| other vegetation of all species and sizes. Most are far below the very high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| transmission lines and can never be a threat to the lines. TVA has used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| herbicide to kill a 10-foot tall maintained hedge of shrubs without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1922)|

| 0:32:10| figure out at first why the shrubs suddenly died. The bottom line is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| that this policy is neither reasonable nor necessary which means that TVA is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| exceeding the legal rights granted by its easements from the 1930s. TVA has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| been continuously and wrongfully misleading the public and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| officials by falsely claiming it must have this extreme policy due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| requirements from the federal government through rules enacted by the Federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Energy Regulatory Commission known as FERC. To help clarify FERC's role in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| regulating utilities it has published a frequently asked questions document. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| very first question is, is it true that electric utilities are required by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| federal law to cut down all the trees near their power lines? The answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1968)|
| 0:32:52| In order, and I'm quoting, in order to prevent power outages federally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| reliability standards require utilities to manage vegetation growth along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| path of their larger power transmission lines to prevent trees or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| vegetation from contacting the power lines. However, federally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| reliability standards do not mandate or prohibit clear-cutting or any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| particular method of vegetation management. Therefore, TVA is solely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| responsible for its policy and must be urged to change its policy back to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| more reasonable one that does not require every relatively small tree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| including dogwoods, Bradford pears, etc. from being cut to the ground. TVA also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| wrongfully claims this policy is necessary because it anticipates there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| could be tougher rules in the future from FERC and thus it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| economical to cut more trees now. This is a totally bogus justification for a bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| policy. FERC does not have the statutory authority to mandate this kind of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| For TVA to enact such drastic policies on such flimsy speculation as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Congress might do in the future is ridiculous. This commission resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| and hopefully with the future passage of a similar one by City Council should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| send TVA's management and Board of Directors a strong message that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| status quo of TVA's policy is just not acceptable to our community. TVA believes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| it can do whatever it wants to do regardless of the harm done despite its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| claims to care so much about the environment, natural resources, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| community. I urge Commission to take this first important step in standing up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| TVA and telling it to stop the unnecessary and unreasonable destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| of Knox County's trees which are a very valuable resource and asset for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| community. If our local, state, and federal officials work together we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| get this policy changed and I thank you very much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| Ms. Margo Klein unfortunately was unable to attend. I know she has sent you an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2083)|

| 0:35:19| Hills Road and we actually had four trees on our property cut week before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| last. I know Mr. Owenby has been out and has seen our yard as well as the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| yards adjacent to ours in our neighborhood. My first dealings with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| were approximately three years ago. We were told that one tree in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| backyard, a sweet gum, was under threat of being removed and over the course of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| about two months of negotiations it was determined that if if we paid out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| pocket to have the tree trimmed that the tree would be left and so we spent just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| shy of a thousand dollars having this sweet gum tree trimmed to actually we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| were told 15 feet. Their law director actually had authored a letter to us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| a diagram specifying what we were to trim. We actually trimmed 25 feet. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| an arborist come out that was certified to trim for them and paid him to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2180)|
| 0:36:28| The other trees that were cut this time when they came out we were given exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| a two-week notice that the trees were going to be cut so our sweet gum that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| spent a thousand dollars to have trimmed per their specifications was cut to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| ground as well as a pine tree and two cedar trees. The pine tree and the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| cedars were not even mentioned as being an issue the previous time. Also to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| back of our property we have a woodline buffer that runs from Westland Drive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| the end of the neighborhood and it's a nice wooded area. You know we have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| of birds, wildlife in that area and also it provides some noise buffer from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| the train tracks over on Westland. They came in three years ago and took 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| small trees out of that area which was the easement depth that they had at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| time and they have since taken even more. I personally believe they're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| beyond what their easement depth even allows. I know that there were four trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| cut in the woodline behind our house this past week and they're still at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| You know every morning we wake up 7 a.m. to chainsaws and that runs until about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| 536 o'clock in the evening. Chainsaws and chippers, the whole neighborhood smells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| of diesel fumes. I think TVA has been accustomed for so long to just running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| roughshod over anyone that that they please. Homeowners, landowners, you know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| they want to cut something they just come in and do it. There's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| consideration for your property value or your ability to enjoy your own yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| They just do what they want and they're not accustomed to having to answer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| anyone for that and I certainly appreciate that Mr. Owenby has come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| to our home and also is sponsoring this resolution. I think it is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| something that it's a first good step in the right direction of letting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| know that this is not an acceptable way to do business. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| We have anyone else? Yes sir. Your name and address to the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| John Owen, 1621 Botsford Drive. I live in the Kensington subdivision. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| anticipating TVA coming through and making some changes to the the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| that we've got. I personally don't think that many of them present a danger to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| the power lines but I think that they are within the 150-foot easement and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| think that TVA should be using a little more discretion in in their efforts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| keep the power lines safe and I understand that we want to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| power turned on all the time but I think that we have trees and there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| reason for us having trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| Yes sir. If you'd give us your name and address of the record please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| Chairman, Commissioners, my name is Burt Robinson. I live at 1716 Dancing Light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| Lane in West Knoxville. I work with TVA in the Valley Relations Group and I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| to thank you for the opportunity to address this topic today. We found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| about the resolution this morning and felt that it we at least needed to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| out and share our thoughts. I wanted to take an opportunity to briefly explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| TVA's policy to maintain a safe, reliable, regulatory compliant, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| cost-effective transmission system to the ratepayers of the Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| TVA has always been committed to public safety and electric service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| reliability. Part of that commitment includes keeping the transmission line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| right-of-way clear of vegetation that could contact electric lines. TVA has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| historically allowed incompatible species within some portions of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| rights-of-way when requested, relying on landowners to control tree height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Sometimes utilities also have implemented pruning programs to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| taller vegetation in some communities. Pruning is not consistent with vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| management best practices because it encourages rapid regrowth, requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| expensive maintenance, excuse me, requires expensive maintenance programs that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| increase electricity rates and can easily overlook trees that need control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| I want to be very clear that FERC, the agency that was referred to earlier, does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| not require that TVA cut down trees. It does not. TVA has made a conscious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| business decision to do that. TVA has approximately 16,000 miles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| transmission line rights-of-way across our seven-state territory and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| issue, one of the biggest issues, is that even though FERC does not require us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| remove those trees, there are penalties for allowing even one tree to encroach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| within a specified distance of a conductor or a power line that can be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| to a million dollars per day for each day that encroachment was deemed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| exist. The financial risks of non-compliance with FERC regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| have prompted many utilities to begin more aggressive transmission vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| management programs to achieve a true wire zone and, if room allows, a border| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| zone as well. This means that many utilities are removing, sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| extensively, incompatible species from both zones. TVA's vegetation management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| program has adopted these vegetation management best practices, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| TVA's own practice of clearing the right-of-way, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| maintains a safe, reliable, regulatory compliant, and cost-effective power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| system. Thank you. We have another person that wants to address this and if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| give us your name and address for the record, please. Kimberly Owen, 1621| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2558)|

| 0:42:48| perspective from maybe your children's point of view. The area that TVA is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| considering leveling at the moment is where I used to play when I was younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| We went out there and played on the trees and like ran around and hide-and-seek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| It's the perfect place for hide-and-seek and I just I can't imagine that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| without all the growth. I mean, consider your children without an area to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| We're always concerned about children getting to play and getting their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| exercise in and everything now, but if there's nowhere for them to play, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| are they going to get that exercise? So, I mean, I understand that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| necessity for the trees to be out of the way of power lines and I completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| agree with that. I don't want my power lines obstructed in any way. I like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| having television and computers and electricity in all forms, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| think a hundred and fifty feet of no trees or plants in any way is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| So, I urge you to consider not only the property values and the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| side, but also where children will play if these are going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| I mean, I climbed trees when I was little. Granted, I didn't do it very well, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| mean, it's something to do and it's something that I think every child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| should have the opportunity to do. So, please consider that in your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| considerations. Any, Commissioner Woodby? Yeah, I just want to make a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| comments. The reason I brought this resolution was to start a dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| between TVA and the property owners, because what this boils down to is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| property rights, and when we start eliminating trees, I'm not for saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| every tree. If a property owner doesn't want that tree, fine, they have every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| right to chop it down, but I went out to this property and I looked at it. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| looks like a tornado, basically, went through there in a line of shot, and four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| trees were removed off Ms. Henry's property. One of them was approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| 12 feet from the back door. None of these, at their height that they were at, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| if fell, would have touched those power lines. Not a single one of them, and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| of their own pocket, an agreement they made two years ago or three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| with TVA, was that they would spend out of their own pocket trimming these trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| to save these trees on their property. Now is null and void, and that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| cannot be recouped, and I just think that government has, or government entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| have overstepped their bounds at this point. When they start going without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| negotiating with a property owner, this is what we need to do. We need to trim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| these trees, we need to do this, or whatever, and work out some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| agreement, then to go in there with police officers on the day they start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| trimming and basically bullying these property owners. Their electricity bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| are going to go up now, because they do not have the shade anymore that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| bought the house and they live in. I talked to the property owner that owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| that stretch down through there underneath the power lines, and she had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| no problem with them cutting the trees in that easement, that's her property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| she said that she would have liked if they would have came and asked her and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| talked to her and worked out something. There's another tree cut down in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| somebody's fenced-in area that was cut down, and they said they battled this two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| years ago, they weren't going to go through it again, they told them go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| and cut it, because they didn't want to deal with it no more. I just think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| is really too much, that TVA really needs to rethink this policy, and they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| go back and they need to talk to these landowners that they're approaching on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| because I believe 150 foot easement is an excessive amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| especially for a tree that's not even anywhere near these power lines, and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| 15-foot, I've got dogwoods in my yard that are 15 foot, so we're going to cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| down everything 15 feet, that just, there's no way to reach, dogwood will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| reach that height, so I think TVA really needs to rethink this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| that's the reason I brought this forward, is basically the property rights are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| being violated of every citizen that's getting cut down. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I've got some questions on this. Mr. Law Director, if we do this, does this mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2832)|
| 0:47:22| a hill of beans to TVA? Well sir, I mean, let's just get frank with you. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| legally mandate, no, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, otherwise known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| FERC, gives wide deference to public utilities in terms of tree trimming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| vegetation. In other words, they don't dictate the manner in which they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| However, TVA has broad authority to negotiate with, or otherwise take into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| consideration, the needs of the local populace, so can you compel them to do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| No, but can you negotiate something to where they'll be more receptive? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| they'll be, I don't want to say they're inconsiderate, but more considerate, or at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| least more receptive to listening to local concerns, then we'll certainly have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| that broad authority, and that's the situation, and this is the kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| dialogue you need, because again, until it's brought to their attention, it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| be negotiated. It's just a matter of, the distinction is you can't compel them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| do anything. I just like what this lady came, you know, they tell her one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| year to do one thing, to come back now, you know, I don't agree with that. Mr. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| can tell you just about every weekend I've got a chainsaw in my hand, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| I've got a minor enforcer from UT. I'd like for TVA to come back to us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| Monday. I need to hear a little bit more information. I need to hear a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| as to what you do, why you do it, and you know, listen to the ladies, what she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| saying. You say one thing, you turn around and do something else. That's not right. You need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| to do what you say you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| Any other questions? The motion on the floor is to approve. All those in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| say aye. Any opposition? Motion is approved. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| Item is on page 6. It's item 27, line item transfers. Is there a second? I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2939)|
| 0:49:11| Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| Chris, where's Chris? Chris, this $90,000 for a contract with PBA, what is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2955)|
| 0:49:31| Then I had a question on the sports operation. Real quick, you explain what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2971)|
| 0:49:38| What page is the first one on? Number 9, page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2978)|
| 0:49:48| It's just transferring budget dollars from buildings over to contract with PBA. PBA does our work for ADA construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=2988)|
| 0:50:03| so we had budgeted the money down in buildings, and we moved it up to contract with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Okay, then number 16, page 16, sports operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| Sports operation is a breakout from recreation and administration. We broke that out in last year's budget line item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3013)|
| 0:50:21| and they bring in their own revenue to do like softball games and things of that such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| and so it's basically moving some funds from other services up to cover some salaries that was moved over from recreation and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3027)|
| 0:50:35| Okay, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Any other questions? The motion is to approve the line item transfers. All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| Any opposition? They are approved. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| Next item is a resolution that was added. It's resolution 101, honoring the women who have served on the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| Do we have a motion? Motion has been made and seconded. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| They are. It is approved. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Resolution 114 was added. It's a resolution approving the appointment of Commissioner Jeff Olinby to the Knox County Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3065)|
| 0:51:16| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| I have a question. This actually may go to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| We were unable to act at our last charter meeting because we didn't have a full complement of the nine plus nine plus nine members there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3087)|
| 0:51:36| and have we got that resolved so when we meet again, we'll be able to, if we need to, go ahead and start passing resolutions and recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3096)|
| 0:51:48| Provided this commission...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I guess what I'm saying, what are we lacking? What do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| Well, that's my point. Next Monday, if you approve the appointment that has been offered by Commissioner Tony Norman, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| That's your last holdout. The last three people he's vetted, they didn't live in his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| This person appears to live in his district, we hope. He does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| If Monday you confirm that appointment, you're at 27, you can move forward and start actually making definitive decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3128)|
| 0:52:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| I have one other item that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| It's a resolution, I guess it's approving a contract with the state of Tennessee for tuberculosis services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3142)|
| 0:52:29| It was added by the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Any discussion? All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| That's all the items we have on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I do have an individual who has asked to speak and address us, Mr. Lance McCold, if you'd come forward, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| and if you'd give us your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Thank you. Lance McCold. I live at 130 Cogdell Road, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| I wanted to speak to you maybe a little in advance of your considerations of the budget for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3176)|
| 0:53:06| I've lived in Knox County for a long time, almost 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Raised my kids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| They did very well in our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| In the last year, I've discovered how much the schools are struggling from lack of sufficient funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3195)|
| 0:53:26| Last Monday, Superintendent McIntyre proposed a significant budget increase for the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| I'm persuaded that they need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| I am a taxpayer and I would be more than happy to see my property taxes increase to cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3216)|
| 0:53:43| And I would urge you to build the increase that the superintendent requested into the county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3223)|
| 0:53:53| and make those funds available and fund them as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you. We have no other... Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Yes. I'm having my usual public meeting at the Time Warp Tea Room, despite it being spring break, on Thursday at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3243)|
| 0:54:14| And I am particularly interested in speaking to anyone who would like to have a further discussion about the pilot proposed by the IDB for the KTOM business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3254)|
| 0:54:30| Anyone from the business, anyone from the IDB, anyone from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| I am all ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Yes. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Very briefly, forgive my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Can you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Steve Seyfried, 1125 Snowden Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS120319?start=3287)|
