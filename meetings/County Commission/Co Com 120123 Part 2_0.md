| 0:00:00| We send their names to the state and the state issues the checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| I'm going to let Gary Hayes talk about different ways county does the salary incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5)|
| 0:00:15| I'm Gary Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=15)|
| 0:00:16| I'm the county government consultant out of the Chattanooga office that had Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=16)|
| 0:00:20| up until Mr. Wesley Robertson is now going to be the official county government consultant for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=20)|
| 0:00:27| He's officially replacing Mr. Ron Woody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=27)|
| 0:00:31| Getting into the local incentive part of it, we at CTAS, we don't track that because you've got 95 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=31)|
| 0:00:38| You've got all the number of elected officials, fee offices that can do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=38)|
| 0:00:43| There are some counties out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=43)|
| 0:00:45| I've got a couple that have a countywide policy that's in effect for all general fund employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=45)|
| 0:00:51| and fee offices that they'll get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| For example, I've got one county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=54)|
| 0:00:55| They pay $1,000 to each employee who either receives a certification or gets recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=55)|
| 0:01:03| They generally pay that out in October when the fee officials receive their certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=63)|
| 0:01:08| I've got some general funds that don't pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| I've got some counties where the fee offices, some do, some don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| It's all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I've got some fee offices that they pay different amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=77)|
| 0:01:22| But it's a local decision that either the county legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| if you don't have a countywide policy that sets forth the amount and the internal controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| and the criteria is how you're going to get compensated if you do for being a certified public administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| If it's not there, then it's going to be, if the fee offices want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| it's either got to be in their letter of agreement or their court order specifying, you know, that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| So it's all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Everybody does different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| I've got some fee offices that it's mandatory, part of their employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| I've got some that don't do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| So it's just, that's why we don't track it because everybody's doing different things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| Does anybody have any questions of these three gentlemen while they're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| So you're saying that it would be up to the county legislative body, according to state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| to give the additional monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| I believe I understood you say 1,500 would be the state amount and then up to another 1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| but it would be up to the legislative body to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| The county legislative body, you know, for the fee official, I mean, if they, if you want to match that 1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| you can, but you have to do it by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| And I've got some counties that there are some counties probably across the state that if, say, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| if this year due to the appropriation and the number of officials that are in the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| instead of it being 1,500, let's say it's 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| The county legislative body has the opportunity, if you so desire, to make up that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| So a lot of it is in control of the county legislative body for an overall program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| If not, then it's up to the fee official and their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| Now, in some fee officials, depending upon what the amount is, it's based upon what the fees they generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| You know, if they don't generate the fees or their fees are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| they're certainly not going to be able to pay, you know, whatever it is, the amount that they had set in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| So that's why it's so difficult to, that's why we don't track it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Because it's all across the board and it's very diverse from county to county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| So if a fee office were to award these minus the legislative body approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| could they still do that under the state law since they are an independent office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| I mean, in terms of the fee official, the fee office, if they choose to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| pay their employees for going through the program, you know, if it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| if the county commission doesn't direct it by, in Knox County's case, it would be by ordinance, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| So if you didn't, if Knox County didn't do it, then it would be up to the fee official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| And how they did that, how they did the incentive would have to be laid out in their letter of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=221)|
| 0:03:48| or their court order as to how they were going to do it, how much they were going to be paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| and whether or not if the, how the fees came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| If fees were less, then they certainly have to make adjustments to the amount of the incentive they were going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=235)|
| 0:04:01| Mr. Law Director, do we have an ordinance or a resolution that has been passed by this body with regards to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| that you're aware of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Commissioner, I'm not aware of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| I asked the clerk's office to do an exhaustive search, and I know they went back at least ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| but yet I've been advised there is one, but no one's been able to display one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| So minus that, then it would be up to the fee offices to make that part of their salary suit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| But I guess if it's part of the salary suit, what the previous gentleman said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| how does that job with the $1,500 with the county can come with another $1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| So if it was solely up to the trustee, would it be a maximum at that point by the state ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=280)|
| 0:04:49| The state, the way the statute is set up, and correct me if I'm wrong, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| You know, it's a maximum $1,500, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| And that $1,500 is based upon whatever the General Assembly makes as an appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| and then it's divided by the number of elected officials that either are certified or have been recertified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| So that amount can always fluctuate, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| So if they, if it turns out to be $1,200 this year, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| they're not going to pay from the state, they're not going to get themselves $1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| unless you've got something there locally that will allow you to make up that shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| But, again, Commissioner, if I could interject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| that's why we need to distinguish between a county officer and an employee, because the statute is bifurcated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| The statute begins with county officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| There's a different code section that defines what an officer is in generally elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| Then later in that code, it then discusses county employee, which has a different definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| County officers, that's where the state kicks in the $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| The incentive for employees is up to the local body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| Elected county government employees are not eligible for the $1,500 that comes from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| to the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Thank you, Mr. Law Director, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| And at the end of the day, I mean, this is pretty complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| I think Chairman has asked some good questions on top of what Commissioner Smith has done throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:28| I don't want this to end, you know, I don't care if anybody thinks I'm beating up on somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| That's really not my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:34| We need to get a clear, clear understanding of what's going on, period, regardless who's in office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| regardless what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:43| So, you know, I guess I'll say, you know, thank you for bringing this to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| And thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| I think we're going to have a lot more questions of you all over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| I mean, over the months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Hopefully it won't go years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Over the next coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| So I appreciate you all coming up for this really important process that we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| Do you all have any other statements you want to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| We don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| You've come a long way and we want to make sure that you have the opportunity to say what you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| Just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| This is a complicated subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| The one thing I would urge you to do is not throw the baby out with the bathwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| This is a good program and we would like to see Knox County, their officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| and their employees to be able to continue to participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So we'll be more than glad to meet with a study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| and come up with a rational policy that makes sense to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Let me get Commissioner Burroughs first and I'll get you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Yeah, I had a question about the stipend or bonus or incentive is about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=463)|
| 0:07:53| or not it's intended to be yearly or if it's the year that you get your qualification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| or if it's intended to be every year after that because I think there's been some confusion on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| so it would be nice to have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| If you're talking about elected county officials, not employees, but elected county officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| it is meant to be an annual stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| And it is subject to whatever amount the state legislature appropriates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| And it's also contingent on how many certified public administrators we graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| So, basically, whatever they appropriate, we take the number of CPAs and divide it into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| that are full-time elected officials and that's how much they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| I think this year they are receiving maybe about $1,300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| The previous year it was maybe we were at the $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| We had enough to pay the full $1,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| But with the budget cut back to the state level, that appropriation has also suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| But it's intended to be an annual amount as long as they get the 16 hours of recertification each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| which is fairly common for a lot of professions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| I know I'm a certified financial planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| and they require me to get 32 hours every two years to keep my certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=552)|
| 0:09:20| And so it's fairly 16 hours a year is a fairly common number of hours to keep a professional certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=560)|
| 0:09:29| In accounting or law or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| But it is an annual appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Now, at the county level, for the county employees, it can be whatever the county commission wants it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=574)|
| 0:09:42| Or whatever the elected office holder for those independently elected offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| whatever they choose and is part of their salary suit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| And if there is not a countywide policy that has been set by ordinance by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=591)|
| 0:09:59| then it's up to each elected official through their salary suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| or their letter of agreement with the mayor to determine what their employees will receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| and whether or not it will be an annual amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| So it's 16 hours for general county employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| but elected officials have to also complete an additional two hours of ethics training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| We did have that, but that has been changed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| And it's only two hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| It's just 16 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| And none of it we used to have two hours specific to ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| but we did away with that and just said 16 hours, which is the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Okay, Mr. Garner, so you're saying if an elected office holder here has employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| has ten employees that have taken and have completed the first year, second year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| second year and thereafter, as long as they take 16 hours throughout a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| they are entitled to that second year bonus, $3,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| If the elected official wishes to set that as their policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| and they have that within their letter of agreement, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Mr. Mayor, can you come real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Is Hugh Holt with you, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| You made a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| He got called away, not by the Lord, but by statuants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| I'll try to answer it if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I'll just defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Well, I think you made comments last week about your office, what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| And Hugh Holt did it with his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| He had a lady that was coming today, and she was going to be certified since 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| and she has never, ever asked for any money, never does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| You might want to speak about Hughes, his group, and or what you've done in your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=703)|
| 0:11:49| I can't speak on behalf of Mr. Holt or the lady in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Well, he was saying what Hugh Holt said was that he's his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| He encourages his people to do it, to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| It's a good course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| And I think it's a good course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Go ahead and take the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| But he's not, you know, if you want to do it, you're doing it for your own knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| and to better serve the public with it and be just a better employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| And that's what this lady called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| And that's pretty much what Hugh was saying, the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| He's, you know, guys, it's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| If you won't take it, I'm not going to reimburse you for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| Same thing, Foster Annette, he has said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| He's saying that, you know, if you all want to take it, take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| But I'm not going to reimburse you any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| And I think that's what you did with your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| I'm not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Then, Mr. Troyer, I have a few real things for you quick, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| A couple questions about this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| We come up with some different figures that we've got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| Like I see somebody here has got $25,394.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Another one is $10,915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Somebody's $3,409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| How do we come up with odd figures with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| Are office holders not paying everybody, the second-year people in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| Are they not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Are they treating everybody separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| It's not been consistent from office to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| And so that's been up to the individual office holders to make those choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Have you all ever questioned that or that's just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| We pay on their direction, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| Explain to us, you'd mentioned to me last week, about how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| I've got a thing here that was put out that Chris gave us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| About $150,000 or $155,000 was given out last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And some of it seemed to think that half of it was Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Well, like the CTAS representatives talked about, some of that is state funded and some of that is local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| And you told me about half of it is local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Comes from out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| And, commissioners, this is why I'm bringing it, because it's coming out of our pockets, this half of this money here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Again, I want to emphasize that the program, I think it is a good program, gentlemen, that you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| I've seen a copy of an old test, very pertinent questions that they've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| Mr. Commissioner, we're going to form a committee, and I've asked, and we're still forming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| I've asked Mr. Troyer to be with us, Francis Fogerson, State Representative Bill Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| I want to get some state people here, because this is a state issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| Therefore, we will meet on Friday afternoons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Mr. Dunn asked if he could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Foster and Ed said he would be happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| And Gary Hayes, Gary, you said you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| And, Gary, any of your other committee people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| This gentleman from Knoxville would be fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Yes, you just let us know, you know, what day and time we'll be more than happy to participate in the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| to help you guys and further get a better understanding of what goes on about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| You know, you're going to be the answer, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| We're just, you know, it's just a lot of questions that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| Does anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Do we need to make this a formal committee, or is it just something that is going to be an informal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| Well, what I was going to do, however you want to do it, I was going to meet the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| If any of the commissioners wanted to attend, you're welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Of course, we'll be open to office holders, any office holders that want to be there, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And we're just trying to make a recommendation, if any, from the committee and bring it back before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| So if you need to want to make a committee, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| If not, I was going to bring recommendations back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| I just want to be sure that we're all dancing to the same music here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| The only people that get money from the state money is an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| If Sherry or Joy has three employees who take this and get this certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| whatever money that employee gets comes from Sherry's budget or Joy's budget out of their salary suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| which is approved by the mayor and eventually, you know, rubber stamped by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| So this is not as big of a mountain on a mole hill as we're making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| The state law says you don't get this money until you've completed the test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| and are certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| That's all that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| You get certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| You get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Whatever that office holder's salary suit says, whether it's this one gives $1,000, this one gives $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| Personally, I think every person in these offices should be certified because they are handling public funds, public issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=991)|
| 0:16:40| They need to know exactly, you know, the right and wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Not that they're not getting that training through, you know, their elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| because they've been around a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| They've done a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| But it just bodes better with us as a community to have qualified people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| It's like having a doctorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| If you're a minister, you know, is he just a Jake Lake preacher or is he a doctor of divinity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| So I know you don't see the correlation, Amy, but bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| I say we're making a mountain out of a mole hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| You either got it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| You get it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| I was trying to figure out what you were saying about what kind of preacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Jake Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| We must not have those in the Unitarian Universal Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| You can't speak country very well, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| No, Larry, my question was I wanted to be on your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| You have to have minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| We need you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Well, Mr. Chairman, if I could, I'm sorry, Commissioner Andrews, but you're going to start trying to form a formal commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| You really should put it on your next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| You can start doing the groundwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| And once you put two commissioners, now you're sunshined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| So understand that's the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| They'll all be sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| No, but I mean I'm saying by law they must be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| You know, there's a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| But it's multidisciplinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| You know, you can certainly start, you know, as expressed before the board, start looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| You should formally create it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Yeah, I was going to keep my mouth shut on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| But I think there's something that needs to be said a little bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| You know, we have county employees, and I'll just go ahead and tell you my wife's one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1103)|
| 0:18:29| that it's required to maintain a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Required, not chosen, but required to maintain a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| She has to have so many CEUs a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| She has to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| And the county provides her with $300 to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| Well, a conference is $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| And we're paying somebody $3,000 to attend a few classes a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| And so I think we need to really make sure that, I mean, the program is a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| There's no question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| But $3,000 when you have employees that are, you know, sheriff's department employees are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| to have in-service, and the state pays, fully pays that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| But you have employees that are required to carry a professional license, you give them $300 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| and you're giving somebody $3,000 a year to be paid to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| You're being paid to go to these classes because it's your day of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| And you're giving them $3,000 on top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| And so I think we need to, I hope the committee really looks at this and sees that it's necessary for each county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| employee to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| If it is, and I think it's great that if every county employee could do that, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| But you're talking about a lot of mass teaching and a lot of budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| And so I think we need to make sure that, is this required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Is it great?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| And why are we paying somebody $3,000 to maintain something that's not required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| And we have employees that are forced to require a licensure that are not paying, again, $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| I think we need to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Yes, I think this leads to a discussion that we need to have, and we, some of us have been trying to have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:19| for the past year about how we treat our employees in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:29| If someone is required to have a certain number of CEUs to maintain their licensure or as part of their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:39| then the county should be covering the cost of that, same as what the sheriff's department teachers have to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| in service days, which they're, the cost of that, they're paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| So this goes back to, are we treating our employees with dignity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:58| Are we treating them equitably?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| Is everyone being treated the same across the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| And we've not done a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Also, our employees, we've asked them to pay higher costs for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| We've asked them to pay higher costs for their health insurance premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And I understand that this is happening all across the country, not just here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| but our compensation for our employees has not kept pace with the things we are asking them to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| or requiring them to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| So, and this is an excellent program, and it's a little different than going to a weekend conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:42| There are differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| But I agree we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| and we need to look at this very carefully and recognize that the value that comes with this kind of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1310)|
| 0:22:01| We've got how many thousand employees in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Only 35 have been certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| It's not something you can just go do over a weekend or, you know, a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| It's, you know, the initial certification is rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And I believe that the cost should be borne by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| and I think that we need to look seriously at some kind of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| This is a good thing for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| So I hope that we won't throw out the baby with the bathwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| and I hope that we will come up with a comprehensive and equitable policy that implies to all of the Knox County employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1353)|
| 0:22:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Just one last thing is, you know, half of us on the commission, we are state licensed maybe in something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| and we all have continuing ed classes that we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I know, Brad, if you have to take a step to the sheriff's department or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| there's things that you may have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| But, you know, I don't get paid a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| It comes out of my pocket and most people in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| That's what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| It comes out of their pocket, and they sure don't get $3,000 bonus for attending a two-day class after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| And that's the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| But I want one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| Did any office holder want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| I know several of them have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| Yes, name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I'm Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Registered deeds for Knox County, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| I just want to say thank you to CTAS and the administrators that came to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| I'm embarrassed for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| What we've done to CTAS, the image that we have portrayed, because it is an outstanding program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I have six people in my office that are certified public administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| I can tell you that you're well getting your money worth out of those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| It is to each individual office holder how much the state law says up to $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| There's not one person in this county government that ever did anything that they weren't supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| And no one ever received the funds until they were certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| I just want to say that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| There's been some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I think it's great to get this out here and get this committee and let people talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| I watched the Gene Patterson show yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| And Commissioner Smith was on there and was talking about some of the other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| And he said that he had talked to the trustee in Hamilton County and that they only gave $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| I didn't, I wasn't sure why that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| So I called the trustee in Hamilton County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| He's never spoken with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| He doesn't know Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| So I just want to say that, for the record, there's a lot of things that have been put out there that just aren't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| If you have any questions about the certified public administrator, I've been a graduate for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| I'll be glad to tell you anything that you'd like to know about it if I can answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Look forward to being at every meeting and anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Again, as you all have, as I told you now, that half of this money for the elected officials comes from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:16| Right now, these people that are in my office is who I'm down here talking to you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| Because the state is going to provide the elected official with their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| This doesn't mean anything to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| This is something for hard-working county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| And that's whose back I cover every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| They do a good job for you, and I'm proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Ms. Wood, I don't think anybody here from the commission is embarrassed whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| As far as somebody calling and saying that they were from the trustee, I took them at the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| I'm sorry I don't have caller ID on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| But I did get a phone call this morning from Union County, and they verified how much they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| And I do know who that person was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| So maybe somebody's playing a trick on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I don't have time to check everybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| We have caller ID in the record room as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| I don't have it at mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| Somebody called my office and said I'm the trustee from the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And we talked for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Folks, let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| I don't have time for games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Again, I want to thank the folks from CTAS for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Thank you very much for your time and for traveling and for making time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| And we appreciate any help that you're going to give us in the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity for us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Let us know when you get your committee set up and what days you're going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| In the time, we'll be glad to come up and meet with you guys and help in any way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Gary, can we get some business cards from you guys before you all get going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Our next discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Do we want to take a quick break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| If we could take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Let's be back at 3.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| And at that time, it will give the folks from KTSC time to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| But we'll be back in ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1618)|
| 0:27:15| Back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| During the chairman's lunch today, we heard a presentation from the Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| And the commissioners felt that we did not have adequate time to ask questions because we're running up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| against beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| So we wanted to have the opportunity to expand that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| And so Gloria is -- there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| I didn't see you pass the plant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Gloria, the floor is yours if you'd like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| I know that you have a presentation for us and then we'll have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| My name is Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Pull the mic down, Gloria, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| I own the mic now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| My name is Gloria Ray, R-A-Y, 4833 River Place Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1672)|
| 0:28:01| I appreciate today, earlier, being able to share with you some facts that we -- that I felt like that it was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| for you as commissioners to know to be able to answer questions from your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| I think it's equally important, and you all have mentioned that as well, is that the general public need to know some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| information so that they have a better understanding about the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| and the work that we do on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| I know that all of you have agreed to act interested when I make this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| but knowing since you've already heard it before, if you all are going to do other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| we have one commissioner that did not get to hear it, so I'm going to do all this just for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| More importantly, for the public, for those that are watching on TV, to be able to hear and see some of the information as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| At the end, we'll be available for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| I have with me the chairman of our board, David Duncan, and I will make him available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| We talked about this morning trying to shift the focus from looking at information that didn't necessarily address the topic of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:16| what are we charged to do by Knox County in terms of what do you want us to do for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| what services to provide, and what results do you expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| When we talk about focusing on the facts, we talk about the structure, the mission, the funding, the business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| which is very important, and the results, which is equally, if not more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| The structure, we are a 501c3 corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| We are governed by a board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| We are not a department or agency of county government or city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| We have board members, 12 at large, which were made up of individuals that served on the Sports Corporation Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| and the Convention and Visitors Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| We have five members of our board appointed by Knox County Mayor and approved by the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| We have three from the city of Knoxville that is appointed by the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| and we have representatives of organizations with whom we work to promote tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Knoxville Tourism Alliance, their executive director is here today as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Their one, the University of Tennessee, is another area that deals with bringing in groups as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1823)|
| 0:30:31| And we have one open position on our organizational group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| On the mission, the mission is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| We are a strategic player on the economic development team for Knox County and for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| And our charge is to how can we take tourism, how can we take travel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| tourism being defined as activities or events that encourage and require people to travel to our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| to experience whether it be a convention, a meeting, a hobby show, to ride their motorcycle in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| to come with their quilts, to come for a scientific group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| What can we do to attract those people to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| So that is our primary mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| And how can we determine whether or not we're doing our mission is look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| there's several ways to do that, and we will talk about that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| But that's the mission is to be a part of the economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| Funding, we receive a fee from the Knox County government that has to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| it's in direct proportion to the hotel-motel tax that's collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| We receive 45% of the hotel-motel dollars that are collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Knox County retains the other 55% and distributes that as they see fit on tourist-related facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| bond indebtedness and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| We receive no sales tax, Knox County sales tax dollars, no property tax, no entertainment tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| it's strictly hotel-motel tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| There are other communities where they receive more and I'm sure there's some that receive less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| I think what we have to zero in on is what are we giving and are we getting the return on investment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| The business model I think is important, one, because it gives us a point of comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| is the new way of doing business producing better results than the old way of doing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| And we have the ability to look at benchmarks and performance measures to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| was there a difference between the old model and the new model or the old way of doing business and the new way of doing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| And we think that there's data that would support that there is a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| and the results tend to be better with the new way of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| The old way tended to be where you would have a smaller group of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| that would then contract out for a lot of their work, their professional expertise in marketing and design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| creative services, strategic planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| We were able to do all that in-house with the professional staff that we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| and it's allowed us to be really more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| In today's world you have to be able to respond immediately, so we're more flexible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| we're more fluid and more timely, but most importantly we get a better return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| we get better use of our dollars by paying the people to do that rather than hiring it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| like some other, the older model would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| And so we can customize specifically to that group that we're trying to recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| and then once they are here we can customize it specifically to that group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| to make sure that their services are more than what they had thought that they could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| So that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| The results, there's several ways to look at results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| The one that I went over and the one, if you'll allow me very quickly to go through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| the U.S. Travel Association and the State Department of Tourist Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| each year conducts an in-depth study that looks at the, and they publish their findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| in the Economic Impact of Travel on Tennessee Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| It is an annual report and it's something that we go by in terms of how are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| compared to everybody else, how's Knox County performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| and it's a way for us to look at what does visitor spending look like in our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| compared to others, travel related payroll, how many people in Knoxville are on payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| because of tourist related or travel impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| We would refer to those as the people in the hospitality industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Travel related employment, it's the money that those folks make that are involved in that employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| And then the last one is what are the local tax receipts that are received locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| as a direct result of travel on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| If I look at visitor spending in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| $672 million a year is spent in Knox County, I mean in Hamilton County, on visitor spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| Visitor spending in Knox County is $717 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| Now the numbers that we are using are not numbers that KTSC or anybody that we commissioned to do this study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| Whether if we agree or disagree with the method, it's the same method that's used here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| as in the other comparison that I'm using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And the reason I'm choosing Hamilton County is not to create a border war between us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| but really to give us an example of the old model that we used to use in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| which we've changed to the new model that we are seeing, we think, performing at a better rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| So if we just look at visitor spending, we now know that published reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| that visitors spend $447 million more per year in Knox County than in Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| This is over a 10-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| This isn't one good year that we're using as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| This is over a 10-year period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| So that incorporates the boom and it also incorporates the bad times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| So it's the good and the bad, and we have to figure out why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| Hamilton County employment figures, in Hamilton County, 7,575 folks are employed in the hospitality industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:42| Knox County, 9,267.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| What that means is Knox County employs 1,692 more people every year than Hamilton County as a direct result of visitor travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| Hamilton County payroll is $162 million. Knox County's is $256 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| What that means, and if you as commissioners are understanding economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| when you talk about economic development and being a part of that team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| we want to be able to show that we can increase revenue, which in this case is taxes, and we can increase jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| Those are the two things I think that you as commissioners want to always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| We want to use that money to create new revenue and to grow jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| And the point that's being made here is that we're, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| you are enjoying a related payroll of $94 million more per year than Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| The local sales tax, or not sales tax, but local tax receipts total, that's all the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| is a direct result of visitor travel, is $14,903,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Knox County, it's $17,292,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| The result, Knox County collects $2.3 million more per year in local tax receipts than Hamilton County as a direct result of visitor travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| So I think that that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| It was at this point in time that I handed out so that you all, not that you couldn't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| or not that you didn't write it down, but I gave you a handout that would allow us to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| some of the information that we've gone over so you could have to study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| and to answer any questions that your constituents may have of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| Commissioner Shouse asked a very good question. Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| He got bored with me and left. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| He asked a real good question about UT home football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| He's a professional staff. I have the numbers for him now on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| You have to keep in mind, though, the growth from $3.8 million to $5.2 million in hotel-motel tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| which we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| There was football being played during the 90s as there is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| I don't know if more people came in the 90s than are coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| And the record, we're climbing out to be back to that type of caliber before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| But just as an example, again, I'm proud to say I went to Fulton, but I can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| If there are seven home games, and let's say the people come from out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| and stay for two nights in the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| Some hotels require a two-night minimum, and you may find that when you travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| You should know that not all hotels require that, but let's just say that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| So seven football games times two nights, that's 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| And let's say that every hotel room in Knox County was used for the home football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| In some big games, that may be true, but in other games, it's not necessarily true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| because there's not that much travel, but let's say that it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| Let's say we're at maximum usage, so it's 8,000 hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| So we take the number of days times the number of hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| And then let's use an average, if you're comfortable with, $150 per night for the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:24| Some will be more, but some will be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| For our groups, when we're figuring economic impact, we use $84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| But let's say for the UT football games, we're going to use $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| So seven games, 14 nights, 8,000 rooms times $150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2440)|
| 0:40:47| and we get the total amount of dollars collected from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| What is the county hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| So Knox County receives 5% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| So that amounts to $840,000, and that is the portion of the 5.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| that can be directly related to home UT football games if it was a sellout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| for all seven home games and they all stayed for two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| So when I said, when I answered Commissioner, oh, you're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| I think we look at that as that's 14 hotel room nights, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| In our business, we're looking at, you know, when we said we booked for future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| what we did last year, we booked, we've got delegate days of 375,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| So 14 delegate days, you know, we have to really put that in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So out of the 145 events, we do not count UT home football games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| as one of the events that we try and take credit for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| But in terms of the difference between the growth before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| you can decide, did more people come to the football games in the 90s, in the 99s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| I think that might have been the year they did pretty good compared to the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| We haven't probably had full attendance, but that gives you a number to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| Going through the fast facts or the quick facts for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| I pointed out some of the performance things that we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| and someone asked me about the customized things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| Both in our marketing and in our services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| we're very strategic in terms of how we actually want to relate to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| As an example, when the quilters were here, we had a block contest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| where 23 participating businesses across Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| we encouraged the quilters to go there and pick up a block to be able to build their blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| and then they were entered into a grand prize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| That was to get the people out and about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| In our custom motorcycle destination rides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| when we work with them in terms of what rides are they going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| the Reuertens National Convention was just held here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Not much publicity, but to us it was pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| There were a lot of people, and they stayed in the rooms, and they spent a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| But we also partnered then with the Knoxville Child and Family Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| and they provided hundreds of packages of diapers, pairs of shoes, clothing, and a sizable check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| So in other words, we'll take the spouses of the attendees for these events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| and we'll have a progressive dinner where we'll go to three different historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and that's always offered to our attendees to see how we can customize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And I'm going to say one other thing about economic impact is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| as an example, when someone goes to and travels with their child to an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| let's say they're going to a soccer tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Does anybody here have kids or grandkids that go to a soccer game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| When you go, usually the child is accompanied by a parent or a grandparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| and sometimes they're brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| The formula that we use, which according to Dr. Steve Morris at the UT Institute of Tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| we're the only ones he's ever heard to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| And I said, well, that's because Knoxville is a conservative city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| and you all look at our numbers in terms of how does that really translate to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| Well, here's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| When we have an athlete come to town, we only count the number of registered and credentialed participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:33| So if you come to a Reuters convention or if you come to a baseball tournament or a soccer tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| we only count the actual participant that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| We do not count any of the traveling party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| And I can tell you when we have a big sporting event, let's say with 2,000 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| we're saying no parents come, no brothers and sisters, and no mammos and papos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| I really don't think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I do think they come, and I do think that they spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| But we don't count that in the numbers, and I think that's important for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| Brad, did you get this handed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Also, if you'll remember, we also handed out the market in review, the year in review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:17| If you want to go over that, I'm not going to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| But I am going to go and talk a little bit about successful initiatives that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| Well, right above that, performances as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Well, KT's successful initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| One of the things that we do is what can we drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| How can we influence how Knoxville is perceived nationally in the media?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| You can do it through paid advertising, and we'll talk about that in a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Or you can do it through editorials where people actually come in and they experience something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| They tend to then write about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| So like in this past year, we have site visits for meeting planners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:56| but we also have what we call site visits where we bring in writers from all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| Here's an example of one that we had that we referred to it as the culture shock, the travel writer tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| It was April 13th through the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| They were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| There was 15 writers from across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| We take them on a very structured four-day trip to experience different parts of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| Interestingly enough, on the second day they were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| one of the stops on the tour was free time to visit Yeehaw Studios, Mass General Store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| Moorlach Music, and Coffee and Chocolate, which were in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| So we take them around to visit, and that was just one of the things that they did on that particular trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| What happens from that is you have then the media who goes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| and they take the records and the notes that they made, and I'm going to hand out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| Here's an example of one of the writers that came to our tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| We were able then for him to have some in-depth conversation with a gentleman by the name of Matt Moorlach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| As a result, this was on a national website that dealt with travel where he was able to talk about Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2834)|
| 0:47:21| and to talk about what he does at his store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| It has to do with music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| I thought you all might find that interesting that that's a pretty good national attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| for someone that is on Gay Street and has a wonderful music story to tell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| and I'm glad to help get that message out about Knoxville and who it includes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| The next thing we want to do is go through some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| The Gotta Know Knoxville, which we talked about, which is the training program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| whereas to date we have trained 916 people, 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| 961 folks have been through the program where they become a certified ambassador for Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| to be able to talk about the things to do here and all the uniqueness about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| The Know It All About Knoxville is a weekly publication or e-mail that we send out for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| that will be in the position for people to say what can we do or what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| It's a calendar of events, for lack of a better word, that talks about all the activities that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| We do this for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| One, so that the local people know, certainly, but equally important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| so that out-of-town people that are here for conventions, meetings, and whatever will know what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| so that they can take part in that when they're not at their conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Team Knoxville is a group of over 3,000 volunteers that are in our database that work different events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| from parking cars or helping park cars to emptying water buckets, whatever it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| And these folks are wonderful, and we're very proud of the work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| The next one is that one of the significant things is our Touch, Know, and Go kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| We call it a virtual concierge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| It is located outside the visitor center so that when our offices are closed or after hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| there's information there that can be obtained just as though we were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Number two, the Market Square Mall has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| Two at the convention center and one at the airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| I mentioned today earlier that Charleston, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| just talked about their getting these particular kiosks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| You'd be glad to know that the people that were working on your behalf produced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| created these over four years ago, and they've been in use already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| The Knoxville Visitor Center is something of which Susan Whitaker, the Commissioner of Tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| would tell you that it's probably the most unique visitor center that is in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| and probably one in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| We're able to offer people an experience of uniquely Knoxville when they come to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| that includes music and food and hospitality, the gifts, the artisans that make things that we sell there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| So it's a real genuine, authentic experience, and we're glad to share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| I think there was some information that I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| I was not in the room, but let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| WDVX pays no rent to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| They have their studios, their business offices, as well as the recording booth and the sound booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| and all that is done at no cost to WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| They do not pay rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| But we're glad to have them as a tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| It's a great relationship in that they then allow folks that come in to get a feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| for what is really unique about Knoxville and the music that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| So we have our food vendor is a local person who is known worldwide for her chicken salad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| and I would encourage you to come to the Coop Cafe and come and also shop in the visitor center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| which has local artisans' art on display or their jewelry and pottery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| those types of things that are for sale that will remind people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| Museums of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| I gave each one today a book of all the things that we do for not-for-profits in terms of advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:30| which, you know, in defense of them, they probably don't even know all the stuff that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| and shame on us for not telling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| But this is a pretty thick book of all the things that have been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| publicity-wise, to try and get people from out of town to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| We don't really get in the business of promoting people to come from south, north, east, or west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| to come downtown for an event because that's no new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| That is money they might have been spending in West Knoxville that they're now going to be spending in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| So we're interested in how can we take these events and get people from outside the area to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| and enjoy them and take advantage of them being in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| So those, I think, are interesting things for you to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| The Authentic Knoxville Videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I gave you a book, I think, of all the different videos that we have done in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| They have been edited, put to music, and now they are on our website as well as our Touch, Know, and Go kiosk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| And it's celebrating the authenticity of Knoxville and also the uniqueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:38| You know, if someone's in town and they want to know where's the best place to go jog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| the video's going to tell them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| If you want to go hiking, you want to go to Iams, you want to go to the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| you don't just look at a brochure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| You actually are able to experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| And we're real proud of those, and I think that's pretty unique for us to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| You see there a list, I mean, an example of we have event management programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| I mean, assets that we share with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| When we're not using them, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| And I gave you a list earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| Everything from coolers to radios to tents to generators to PA systems to tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| whatever they need to put on a community event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Locally, we provide those primarily to groups that it saves them a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3199)|
| 0:53:27| And lastly, we talk about our accredited thing that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3207)|
| 0:53:35| It really judges us in their standards that the national organization has established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| that we have to meet a certain standard to get the accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| And there's over 1,500 people just like us, DMOs, not the same business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| but same type of organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| And of the 1,500, only 135 at this point in time are certified and accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| Knoxville and Knox County, you should be proud, are one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| In the state of Tennessee, to bring it home more closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| in the state of Tennessee, there's only two, and Knoxville is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| So we're very, very pleased that we were able, and the staff, this is a reflection of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| You look at all the different areas that we're judged on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| I'd like to think that that's pretty broad-based in terms of what the judgment might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| At this point, I think I handed out the facts for the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| the summary of our marketing and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| We also handed out at some point in time the frequently asked questions that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| that I know that you all are receiving from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| I think it's an opportunity to go over and look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| I did not go over the charts and graphs in the fact sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| You all can do that at the request of people in the audience that have heard this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| We're going to shorten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| But the frequently asked questions, I think they're pretty relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| I think it corrects or clarifies or adds to some of the information that may be out there erroneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| or information that's out there that has not been complete in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| You can talk about facts, but it's kind of like you need to turn the page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| and see what does the next page say, or you need to really focus on what is relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| in terms of, in this regard, Knox County has contracted with KTSC to use tourism as a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| to actually produce economic impact through travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| And that's what we think we're being judged on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| We hope that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| One of the biggest, and this is my favorite, a lot of you have said, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| we don't have the Honda Hoot anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Well, Knoxville did not lose the Honda Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| The Honda Hoot decided, from an economic standpoint, they did not have the money to do that event anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| So what did our staff do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| The staff went out and found another group that would never come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| because we had the Honda Hoot that we were then able to attract them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| It turned out they were a bigger event that produced more economic impact than the Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| And I can tell you that if the Hoot comes back into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| I think that the indications are they will return to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| And so we've got that base covered pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| So I don't want anybody to think that we, quote, lost Honda Hoot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| I think the next question on the top of Page 2 is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| A lot of information has been put out of what percentage of our revenue is spent on salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| and what percent of revenue is my salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| I think to look at is what percentage of the money that's given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| for our contract to provide these services is spent directly and targeted on performing our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:53| And in that regard, it's 95% of the money we receive, which is 3.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| We spend $3,202,000 on direct program services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| And that's on the 990 that has been passed around and handed out and distributed and whatever else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| But if you go through a couple more pages, I think it's Page 8 or 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| begin to look at those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| It will tell you a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| The question has been made, and rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| and Dr. Briggs was the one who brought it up in terms of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| It's troubling for some that we don't spend as much money on advertising as other communities might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| And we're comparing ourselves with the one that's the traditional, the old model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| the way we used to do business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| And what we find that from the national accredited or national organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| they will tell you that the investment in the people returns the best result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| As a matter of fact, the people that we have, our internal sales staff, our marketing team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| that's going to site visits, to trade shows, to FAMS, whatever, you know, we do a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| And it takes people to do them, the boots on the ground, for lack of a better word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| That has proven to be 80% successful in producing the highest quality of leads for business that we can sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| Whereas on the other end of the spectrum, consumer advertising is successful 8% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| So, you know, if you compare the two models or compare the two investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| our decisions that are made by the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| we are comfortable with what we're doing is really working when you compare us to those that do the other model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| How do the advertising investments compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Chattanooga spends $3.5 million on advertising and produces $4.5 million in county hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| Knoxville spends $382,000 on advertising and produced $4.8 million in county hotel motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| Compare the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| Where is the biggest return on your investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| If you look at the return on investment of advertising as it relates to local tax receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| which is one of your charges to us, is to raise revenue, generate more money, more tax revenue from tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| If you look at the way in Hamilton County, for every dollar they spend on advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| it results in $5.18 in local tax receipts collected as a result of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| In Knox County, for every dollar that's spent, it receives $51.78 in local tax receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:30| So, again, we didn't come up with the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| This is not something that we've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| But it is, in fact, if you do a little bit of research, you can find this particular information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| So that is what I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| I think my concern is that while there may be this information that's available, it's not necessarily getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| And shame on us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3591)|
| 0:59:52| We need to do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| We just felt like you gave us the charge to promote Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| and to get people to come here and visit in Knox County and spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And we really haven't taken that money to promote the KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| But maybe we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| So, anyway, I'm here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I know there's some on compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| And Chairman Duncan's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Let me go about the Hall of Fame, though, just shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Because we've already delayed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| I mean, you've postponed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Do you want me to do Hall of Fame?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| If you all get questions, one of the questions is, where did KTSC, how in the world did they accumulate $6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| Have they been hoarding that money or taking money from Hotel Motel Tax and putting it in some secret savings account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| This $6 million was raised from private individuals and corporations and foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| We've been raising it since, oh, probably 1997, 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| I know Pat and I particularly went directly to a lot of these large corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| The Bond and Basketball, they didn't just happen to decide they wanted to have their name on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| They had to pay money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And that helped build that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So we've raised that $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| And there is no hotel tax money in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| There's no sales tax, no property tax, no wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| It's strictly so that hopefully will alleviate the mind of some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| So that, I think, was the main question I need to ask about, answer about Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| On the compensation, you can go through the frequently asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| Basically, it's judged on my background is to be competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| You win and you lose and you sell and you don't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| And if I am brought in and I am paid and I do not set my pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:45| I gratefully certainly take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| But I hope that the numbers will show that the growth in our tourism has been significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| It's not just because of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| It's because of a wonderful staff that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| And as the leader of that group, I'm very, very proud to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| You know, in sports, which is my background, if you win games, you get to stay and they pay you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| The more you win, the more you make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| If you lose games, you either get fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| And my board has been very clear, or my chairman certainly, as long as you, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| are bringing in more and more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| But if you don't, you don't get any compensation past your bonus, past your base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| And if you don't do that, you get fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| So it's those of you that are in sales or those of you that understand the business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:40| we're running this, and maybe this is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| I think somebody said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| We're running this like a business model of a for-profit company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| that we're trying to take the money that's being invested in us to get the best return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| on how we can take those dollars and bring in more money for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| So we're a little bit different in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| So, anyway, any questions for me on this or I'll be glad to answer any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:09| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Yes, Ms. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I want to thank you very much for, one, meeting with me Monday and taking, coming on a holiday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| and visiting with me and answering a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| The information that you have given us is very helpful to answer a lot of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| And I was real frank with you Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I hope you felt I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Just the concerns that the citizens have of how the taxpayer part of the funds that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3817)|
| 1:03:46| and I know it's not our taxpayer money unless we stay in hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| which I've stayed in several of ours in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| But, still, it's money that could go to the general fund to pay down debt or other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3833)|
| 1:04:00| I mean, I'm just saying, if it was, if we didn't have that allocated to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| But there's a couple of questions, and you answered a lot of them on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| But I just want to, with everybody watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| and just get basically your answer back on here so that everybody knows everything's on the up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:25| We don't control your salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| The commission does not vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| We have nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| But there is a lot of questions still that the public just wants to, they're upset about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:42| Who negotiated your salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| I know you already answered that Monday, but I just want to get it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| So we got all the facts out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| Who you will be meeting in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| The chairman of the board does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| And he then, prior to the negotiations, gets with a business consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| and the board auditor to gather data and do some conversations in terms of what is comparable in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:10| it's very hard to find anybody like us that runs a hall of fame, who runs a sports corp type of model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| and also runs a CVB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| So it's very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| So it takes someone that's in the tourism industry to understand what type of individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and what traits must they have to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| And I will let him speak as to why he did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| One thing I do want to say is for the people to understand, I know that there's, I saw one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| I don't read the blogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Everyone, to the T, everybody has said, don't read the blogs, it's just ugly, or the comments on the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| And sometimes that's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| But when I read it, I figured it wouldn't be as hard not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| But one of the comments that I read was, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| you know, if we can take KTSC down, maybe we'll have more money to build roads and support public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:03| Our hope is that you understand that the more money we generate through economic impact, those do go to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| Because the state sales tax and what's local, so much of that is dedicated to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| I think the only discretionary fund from taxes, I know this in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| 0016 is not already designated for some use of local sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| And state tax, we also get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| But I think we need to go back, and the law director can support this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:38| is that the granting authority to allow counties to charge a hotel-motel occupancy tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=3998)|
| 1:06:47| also spells out how it can be used and how it should be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| So the matter of could we take that hotel-motel fund and pay down the general debt, the answer would be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4013)|
| 1:07:01| You know, it's not that's the enabling legislation is really targeted on it must be for tourism-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:11| Forty percent is for construction debt service of tourism-related facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| A lot of that's going to the convention center, East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| So there's, I think, last year the homes were out of that area, historic homes that got support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| Ten percent goes to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| And 45 percent is going to the KTSC, Coast County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| And when we did the contract last year and even before that, it was a continuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| Of the ten percent that they have, five percent is added to that 40 for a total of 45 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| When we were separate, when we were the CVB and the sports corp, we received 48 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| So it opened things up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| And our hope is that we take that what I call marketing money and not dilute it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| and spend it on things that are not growing jobs or increasing revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| And I get the look from Mr. Hammond, so I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Yeah, just one or two more and I'll be done, I promise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| The executive board, are they appointed by, who are they appointed by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| Are they part of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| The executive committee is by nature of your position as an officer on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| Plus the county has a representative and the city has a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| And then the only other question that citizens have voiced to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| and I've got e-mails and phone calls about, was how come the majority of the board does not vote on your salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:42| It's pretty traditional and not for profits that you have committees do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| I think one of the local media called somebody from some outside school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| But I think if you look at it, a lot of times and most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| the executive committee acts on behalf of the board and makes those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| A couple of things that I wanted to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| One is also about the issue about the football games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:15| The hotel-motel collections that you've got here, this is an indication of how many hotel rooms are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:23| The collections for that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| The collections for that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| So that, to me, is a really good representation of the fact that, you know, it stays pretty steady throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4165)|
| 1:09:35| There's not a huge spike during football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| I mean, you all are keeping these rooms booked year-round, not only during.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| And in reality, because the university is such a great economic partner for this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| people come here and spend money and they buy merchandise and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| But that, usually when we have a home game, we're not going to be booking or having groups come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| because the facilities are in use and or the hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| So, but again, I go back to that's 14 days out of 365.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| So in the month of October alone, the hotel in this month, this October of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| we had over $600,000 collected from the hotel-motel tax just in that one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| And keep in mind, the analogy I gave you of the seven home football games in totality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| if it was totally booked for all of them, was $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| So it's really, while it's important, but you would never see us claim UT football games as something that we brought to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:46| Also, a comment I wanted to make is that the, you know, our numbers are really good compared to Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4246)|
| 1:11:00| and to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| And something you said earlier is you were apologizing for being competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| And I don't ever want you to apologize for being competitive because that's one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| that our numbers are so good in comparison to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| There are a couple things that I'm going to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| and there are going to be some people who aren't going to like what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| But that's never stopped me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| My, what I'm hearing a lot, and this is very, this angers me a great deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:37| is what does a 64-year-old unmarried woman need with that much money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| I'm getting a lot of comments like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| You don't ever, ever hear anyone make a comment like that about a 64-year-old man being compensated in a similar manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:59| A lot of what I think we're seeing is rooted in the fact that Gloria is an incredibly successful woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4319)|
| 1:12:09| And I think that if there were a man in charge of this corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| that a lot of what we're seeing we would not, we would not be seeing and hearing these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:22| I happen to know that there, you know, there are a lot of men CEOs and presidents of non-profits here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:30| who make a higher percentage of their organization's overall budget than what Gloria has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:38| And, and whose budgets are smaller but whose base salary is higher than what Gloria makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:49| I really feel like as far as your pay, because really there's a lot of interest in your compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:58| which is why I'm making these remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| Your job is to promote Knox County outside of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| not to promote yourself or your organization to Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| And that is unfortunate that I think that where some of this has come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| But your, as I said, your base salary is lower than a lot of CEOs of non-profits who are male| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| and who have a higher budget than you do to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| And as far as your incentive payments, you have benchmarks that you have to meet to make those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| And those benchmarks go up every year, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Whether or not, well, do we do a good job of supporting our arts and cultural and heritage assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| and community here in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| No, we don't, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| But that's not your problem or your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| That's where we have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| So I just want to say I think you're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:57| All of our numbers here reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| I think it's very unfortunate, the tone that a lot of this has taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| I think you've handled all of this in an incredibly professional manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| And I don't want to lose you away from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| I'm grateful to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Laura, if I might make just a couple of quick comments and then we'll have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| You are in a highly, highly competitive situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| For example, I was invited to Sevierville just last week to meet with Martha Norris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| who is the executive director of the Sevierville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| I was invited there because they want to start doing concerts at the Sevierville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| And they were having a concert that Sunday night after the Lady Vol game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| Nine thousand high school students were there for a Christian concert, and they were booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| I point that out because that's one event, but that's what you're up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| You're up against the Sevierville Convention Center and all of their hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| You're up against the new Gatlinburg Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| You're up against the Pigeon Forge Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| And this is just right down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| I mean, you know, we've got Hamilton County sitting down there and Nashville and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| So I think that you've done a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| I get those monthly figures out of Pigeon Forge every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| I know that last year they lost millions in their hotels, not any fault of their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| It's the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| But everybody's scratching their heads saying, what do we do to get people to come to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| and spend their dollars in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| The fact that we've been able to do that here and that you've shown us the numbers that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| I think is just outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| I don't mean to be a meddler and I don't mean to poke my nose in your business because it is your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| And I know that my compensation is done by a group of folks at my company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| and it is what it is and I negotiate it and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| My only suggestion to you would be is that you and your board, and, again, it's just a suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| that you look at having the whole board know what your compensation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| I think we've learned from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| That would be my suggestion is that you and your team look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Gloria, when you, your initial conversation was kind of a comparison to Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:20| And, you know, I'm a data guy, so pardon me for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| Aren't we really looking at apples and oranges as it relates to Hamilton County because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:31| and maybe a better picture would be Hamilton County, which is where all my family is from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| came from a lot lower state than we did from having facilities and things that people wanted to go see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:49| When we compare the amount that Hamilton County brings in, wouldn't it be better to maybe look at it over a period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4609)|
| 1:16:58| Because, you know, as I think Commissioner Schall said, and I've heard the same thing from a Nashville gentleman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| having the university right off downtown, you know, is great for tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| It's great for that stability piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| And Chattanooga doesn't have anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| So theirs is kind of an apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I'll shut up and let you answer that and then maybe ask a question of you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| Well, what I was trying to, the point I was trying to make is that of the $5.2 million that is raised from economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:33| in hotel-motel taxes, I'm sorry, if you took the seven home football games, that only generates $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4653)|
| 1:17:43| So if Chattanooga wants to give us the aquarium and the riverside and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:48| I'll give them $840,000 in exchange for what they got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| Because that's what it's valued to us in terms of hotel-motel tax dollars is $840,000 out of $5.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| And the thing that you have to also realize is that we've been having football games in Knoxville for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Well, and I guess mine wasn't always with what Ed said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| The University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| I mean, having the premier research athletic employer in higher education nestled right here in Knox County helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:27| And it's helped traditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| And I guess that's my point on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| And then I've got a question for you, Board Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| I'm going to go to Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:41| I'm David Duncan, Chairman of the Board of the Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| My address is 4924 Kingman Drive, Knoxville, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And I can imagine it is difficult to find a comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4733)|
| 1:19:01| But let me ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| Isn't that a lot of money regardless how we look at it for East Tennessee, for this environment, for this tax structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| for, you know, median salaries of CEOs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Isn't that a lot of money when you compare, okay, convention and tourism and plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4756)|
| 1:19:22| And then you go to, you know, when you put those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4762)|
| 1:19:30| But you kind of meld that with this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| You know, and I'm asking the question because that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| At the end of the day, that is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| And, you know, a lot of us didn't know about the total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| And so I just want, please help me, help me understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| Yeah, and through this process, some days I've thought, am I the only one that knew how much Gloria got paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| I would be the first to stand up and say, and I will say it publicly, that, yes, it is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| Any way you look at it, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| When you look at Gloria's base pay, it's not really out of line with anything you want to compare that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| You know, any organization in town, any not-for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| As I said, you know, to give you a little bit of background, if I can take just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:18| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| I was the chairman of the board of the old Knoxville Tourist Commission before we formed KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:29| In that role I did spend several months as the president of the Convention and Visitors Bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| essentially the role that Gloria fills now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| So I did sit in that office and I did see everything that went on as it related to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| I can tell you that for quite some time the old tourist commission board had realized that Knox County not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| should be doing more but could be doing more if we had a different model to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4853)|
| 1:21:02| That was pretty well impossible in the old situation that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| So we put our heads together and we decided that the right thing for Knox County was to merge the old tourist commission board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:14| with the sports corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| One of the problems, though, is while we saw that there was the potential there to do more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| there was no model out there that we could actually pick up and run with to do that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:32| And we needed somebody that had the vision and the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| There was no cookie-cutter formula for doing a better job of selling Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| So Gloria has been the person that has had that vision and that ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| And I think we all know that no, you know, and I don't want to take away anything from the KTSC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| because I can tell you we have one of the most fantastic staffs in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| And I have actually served continuously on the board since the old tourist commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| There are two of us that are still on the board that are left from those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:15| There's one left from the tourist commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Susan Brown is the one that's left from the sports corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| So we're sort of the corporate memory at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| I rotate off the board at the end of this fiscal year because of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| Susan serves one more year on the board because of term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| So that corporate memory of where we were and where we are today will be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:40| So there's a new generation of leadership coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| That being said, it was very important for me, as I sat down and looked at Gloria's salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| that we find some way to compensate her in the manner of what she had brought to the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:59| I sat in on the initial negotiations when KTSC was formed as to what her salary and compensation would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| And at that time we decided on a base salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| which I might say if we still had the old convention and visitors bureau and the sports corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| we would be paying out more in combined salary than we are to Gloria now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I understand that that is in some ways a moot point, but if we're going to look at the model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:26| we really are still getting a better deal than we were under the old situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| When we sat down to look at Gloria's compensation, we came up with a base salary that we thought was fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| and it was based on some combination of the old salary between the two organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| but realizing a considerable savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| And then we knew there had to be a bonus component as a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| because the only way we were going to be successful in building this new model was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| to incentivize the pay of the person that was giving the leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5034)|
| 1:24:02| The chairman at the time and I sat down with Van Elkins, who is still advising us on these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| and we looked at all of the potential ways to figure a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| and we literally took a shot in the dark because we didn't know what the model needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| So we sort of arbitrarily set up a bonus structure, and we ran with that for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:25| And as we moved into the future and we saw what the potential was for business in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:32| when I looked at Gloria's bonus at that time, when I became chairman, I thought, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| this bonus is really just a pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| The criteria for this bonus pretty well assures that Gloria would always get what that bonus level was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| So when I sat down with her to negotiate the salary, I said, Gloria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I'm not willing to increase your base pay beyond what the formula was with your original contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| So where she is in her base pay is exactly what we negotiated when Gloria first came to work for us at the KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:06| But I said, I am willing, if you can continue to perform and to lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| and to have the vision at KTSC to take us where we need to be into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| and so we can see that this is the increase in hotel-motel tax collections was dramatic almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:26| And I wanted to be sure that wasn't an anomaly, it wasn't just a blip on the radar screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| that we could continue to do that as we moved into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| And we sat down and we came up with a bonus structure that I still today, standing before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| feel like adequately represents what Gloria brings to the table at KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:50| It is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| But if you look at what we've done over time, the bonus calculation has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| As our contractual relationship with the city changed, that bonus structure changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| because of some of the changes we made in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5162)|
| 1:26:07| Our benchmarks have been ever-increasing every year, and it's still, it gets higher next year than it was this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| But even in times of economic downturn, which as Chairman Hammond pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:20| some of our very close neighbors have actually realized dramatic decreases in their hotel-motel tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:29| We have been able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| And we've given you the figures today to show that we have grown not only the hotel-motel tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| but the economic impact of what KTSC does in every year, even in recessionary times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| And I think those results speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| I'm very involved, as Chairman Hammond is involved in Pigeon Forge, I'm involved in business in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:57| And I have first-hand knowledge of what Hamilton County does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| And I'd say they might like to steal Gloria away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| In fact, when we were talking in our other meeting, I thought, well, maybe what Pigeon Forge needs is Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| But I'm not willing to give her up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| I guess, though, I still would like to know, once you went from the arbitrary to the more tangible and metric-based system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5238)|
| 1:27:29| what you, how you pull the numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| Because I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| As far as the base salary, I don't, I'm sure there's bloggers out there that are going to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| But I think the base salary probably isn't an issue with anyone of a reasonable mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:51| in understanding how these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| I want to tell you what we looked at, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| It is almost impossible to find a peer city that is on par with Knoxville because not many places do what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5276)|
| 1:28:06| I would, I can't give you the empirical data on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| but I think I can stand here today and tell you that in terms of money spent and results we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| that Knoxville is one of the premier convention and visitors bureaus in the country as far as results is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:27| So we looked at cities beyond just, you know, similar population, similar resources as far as taxes are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5307)|
| 1:28:36| We looked at cities that have not only the convention and visitors bureau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| but they also have a sports corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| They also have a hall of fame of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| And we tried to reconcile those as they related to what we were doing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| And we wanted to keep the maximum possible amount of Gloria's compensation, not base pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| but what she could attain if she met the benchmarks on par for what that would be with other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| And we set a percentage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| We've changed that a little bit over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| Gloria's total compensation package, if we were going to compare apples with apples of cities that have a CVB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:22| that have a sports corporation and have some kind of a hall of fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| if we adjusted those to Gloria's numbers or to our numbers and then we looked at Gloria's salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:34| she still is not getting paid as much as the people that run that similar organization in those cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| So from, you know, again, it's almost, it's just almost impossible to find an exact picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| But we did build a, and we've got all of that information that I could share with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:54| because we review it periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| Van and I sit down and review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| So we still are significantly below what cities that do the same thing we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5399)|
| 1:30:08| but adjusting for the amount of resources we have, Gloria's compensation is still below what that average would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| So a question for Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| I'll give a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| And this is, you know, I think you and I have talked about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| That 5 percent, 8 percent, 5 percent, whatever, it's 5 now, was 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| To be quite honest, and I know you don't have total say in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| and that's part of the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| But to me, I tend to agree with Mr. Moorlach in terms of how we're dealing with the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:45| That 5 percent, I do, frankly, I wasn't there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| I'm here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| But hearing the historical piece of it, I do think that other body did more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| They had more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:01| But they did more with a wider swath of people, just to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:07| Like I said, you and I have talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| So I hopefully will have a conversation about this when the time comes up for us to deal with this one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:20| I just think as far as truly the arts and cultural piece of things, which draws people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:30| and it's not folks going from this segment to that, you know, segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| It's the wholeness of Knox County that we market and put out there and say, come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| I do think we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Just, and that's, I'm only talking about that piece of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| So I just want to kind of put that out there and maybe let you comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| Back to the benchmarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Let me, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Chairman Duncan noted that there are increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| An example would be the way we got the benchmark in the first original contract was based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| on the three-year average prior to the formation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| The next contract negotiation, we had a four-year average of what the new model was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| So that then was moved up by $400,000 because that's where we saw the average was being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:23| That increases as we get more data to make that benchmark go higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| We go from 100 million to 110 million, 120 million to 130 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| So those are going up based on data that we have performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| In terms of, you know, I think the Arts and Cultural Alliance, they're an organization of a group of arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:49| and cultural and historical and museums and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| As a matter of fact, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is a member of the Arts and Cultural Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| As is Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Beck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Anyway, it's a group of individual groups that go together as an alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| And they're under good leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| If you'll remember a couple years ago when their funding was cut, a lot of them were surprised that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| ended up with zero in funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| We were pleased that we were able to take some money out of our depreciation account for our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| and funded them at $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| If you look at the amount of funding that we're spending on them already, we're very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| very proud of that in terms of what publicity we can give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| This is not an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Well, it should not be an argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| This shouldn't be a funding argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| It is probably somebody said, why is all this happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| And I said, well, I think it probably has to do with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| And that's a shame because the arts and culture, the history, the music, the food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| that is the fabric of who we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| And that's what we sell every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| I actually had worked with the finance department administration of trying to find ways to identify money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:11| for the arts and cultural alliance in the budget that you have that you will be beginning to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| Could we in fact look at, if you look at the wording in the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| in that 40% that has to go to debt service or construction or maintenance or operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| is there money there that could be used to support these organizations that are tourist related facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| And we were able, you know, I put forth a number of about $310,000 could possibly be there in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| for arts and cultural alliance so that you take the marketing dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| and you don't dilute them for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| If you want to grow it, you have to actually do things and not just keep up a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| And so we would look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| And again, if you go through your book, we've tried to work with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| and we have worked with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| It came as a big shock to us as anybody that the decision was made that from a funding standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:13| We're very pleased with our contract with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| We would like to think that you all think that we deserve what we get on the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| I firmly believe in the old adage, you get what you pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| Several in this room and several out there listening and watching have either are currently in sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| or they have been in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Anytime you're in sales, you get paid for producing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| You don't sell, you don't get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| That's bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| I mean, it's the ABCs of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| We take things sometimes and pick at them and pick at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| The last time we complained about what Derek Dooley makes, how much tourism does he bring in versus 100,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| whatever his salary versus 500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| Or anybody else you want to pick down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| You know, to me, this seems like a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| Quite frankly, a witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| You get what you pay for, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| They have the results, and I'm very pleased with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Gloria, thanks for the run of the quick numbers on the football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| I missed part of your explanation when I stepped out briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| You said 840,000 generated by seven home games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| Hotel-motel tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I think you gave the number 5.8 million, and what we got here from John earlier is 5.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| I said the ten-year average has been 5.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| Last year was 5.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| He's projecting 5.4 or 5.9 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| So, anyway, that's about 15 or 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| So, not a big number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I'm doing the 840 over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| So, 15 or 16 percent of the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| I'd give up $840,000 to have all the things that he mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| We'd have to swap Nylan Stadium for the aquarium and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| I mean, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| I mean, that's a bizarre analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| But a 5.2 million, that is about 16 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| So, the 84 percent, I'm not claiming the 84 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| I'm just saying look at the model of what it was and where it is today and how has it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| Explain to me how the state, I think it's the state statute involved, dictates how this is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| Forty percent has to go to an organization like yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| And then is the other 60 can be spent as the county sees fit or is it tied to debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| It's tied as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| There's 40 percent that goes to debt service for tourist-related facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:14| In the past, you've used that or it's being used now for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| It was used for Three Ridges Golf Course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| It's been used for the Tennessee Theater, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| East Tennessee History Center right now is still receiving funds from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| And it can also be used for the operation and maintenance of tourist facilities that are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:37| So, that pool has grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| You know, a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| When the convention center was built, there was a desire by the administration at that time to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| to try and get the county to give the entire 40 percent to debt service for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| And the commission was, I think, smart in saying we will give up to a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| but not always give the total 100 percent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| So, that's capped at 1.5, which is what it was when it first started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:11| That portion now is near two million, two and a half million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| So, that pool is growing from which you have to do debt service and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| There's 40 percent in the statute that says must go to an organization, a marketing organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| a CVB, Convention and Visitors Bureau type of organization, that that's what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| They're obviously accredited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| It doesn't require that, but I think that would be a good feather in anyone's cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| And they have a history and track record of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| Then the county hotel mototax, 10 percent of it is given to the city of Knoxville to be used for tourist-related entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:52| and activities and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| And then the county has an additional 10 percent that they then determine how they want to use that for tourism-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| That's the one that you've been giving eight percent to the sports corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| and two percent to Ramsey House, individual organizations as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| When we combine the two organizations, that went to, of your 10 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| you're taking five percent and using in the marketplace as opposed to two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| But 10 percent given to the city, I assume that's from hotel motels within the city limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| It's 10 percent of what's collected in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| It's given to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| The city also, if you'll keep in mind, they have a city sales tax that's to retire the debt service on the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| Right, yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| I remember all the debate of having to get the funding streams for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| The city, you're comfortable then with two-thirds, or maybe that's a stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:55| 62 or 3 percent of your budget going to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| I know, I saw your numbers here, and I've read them two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| One dollar on advertising, Chattanooga, they generated five bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| One dollar here, we generated 51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| You're comfortable with that large of a proportion of your budget going to compensation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| The number that I look at is what percentage of the money that we get do we spend on our programming services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| and it's at 95 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| And the question on advertising is how within that money that we have do we spend, how do we spend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:37| We think that because we have some degree of history and expertise in marketing and sales and services, it's probably best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:46| you know, I would dare say that you didn't realize that spending on advertising, as known by the national organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| is successful 8 percent of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| If you're a leisure market, if you're a Disney or whatever, you might advertise more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| but we're actually going after conventions and meetings and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| Our leisure travel, we do through a lot of editorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| We do some placement of advertising, Southern Living, those, you've got that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| those numbers in there as well in the market and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| So I'm more comfortable that we're getting a better return on what is spent and what is produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| I think the mistake is to look at one page of a 990 and not bother to go to the next few pages down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Define programs and services for me in addition to compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| Well, those are the different things that you do to conduct your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| Is that producing collateral material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Is that site visits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Is that trade shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| Of the money that we receive, 744 is in management and general operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| whereas 95 percent stays in the selling of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| I think it's, I'm not disputing what Amy said, but I have not, and I've discussed this with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| My head may be in the sand, but I haven't heard anyone bring a gender issue into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| I've heard from people at my church and businessmen and women this morning at the governor's breakfast and odds and ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| and I've not heard a person say, I can't believe that woman makes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| I've never heard them say, I can't believe that person is being paid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| And the difference to me is that, I know we may say the guy from Ohio is paying it, so it's not out of our pocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| but it still is flowing through this building, the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| You're agreeing it's flowing through this building and into the sports court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So it is taxpayer dollars, even though it may not be directly Knox County taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| If we didn't spend the, that's money that if we had $10 million coming in instead of $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:57| that would be $10 million that we could do these other nice things with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| Well, not necessarily, is it, with those ratios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Well, yeah, I mean, when I look at things like the Tennessee Theater, East Tennessee Historical, the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| those are things we would probably fund anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:16| The National Rec would fund the golf course, possibly, instead of being funded through Hotel Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| We may be arguing on academic issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| But to me, it is a, why it is an issue is that it is taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| even though it may be the guy from Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| You know, we've got a lot of rich people in this community, you know, DeRoyal and Pilot and Clayton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| and people that make millions of dollars, but that was earned, you know, totally in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| And when it's earned in the public sector, I think that's why it becomes an issue, at least it did to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:50| And I think that's why it's generated the buzz in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| I looked at your salary through the years on that Sentinel thing they run every Sunday on page three of the business section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6295)|
| 1:45:02| They list, you know, they come up with things I can never think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| But the salaries, and you were at 250-ish or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:11| And that's why one reason, which I thought was a pretty good salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| but that's one reason I was shocked when I saw it was in excess of 400, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| which is, again, being not necessarily because it's just non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| but it's non-profit paid with taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| That's why it's an issue to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| You know, three times what the mayor makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Maybe you do three times the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| That's a bad analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| But it's a big paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| And it's just, I think that's why it's generated the buzz that I've heard anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| And I have not heard anyone criticize you for gender or old, young, black, white, anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| Just, you know, it's a big paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| And I do appreciate what David said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| although I don't know how we would ever get a true market comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:04| without spending half a million dollars of what somebody like you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| Are you worth the 405?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| Are you worth 200?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| I just think that's a stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| I don't know how we figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| But to me it's a very rich compensation package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| I don't vote on it, but it's a very rich package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| And thank you for the good job you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| Would you mind if I just speak a word or two about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| As I was listening to what you had to say, Commissioner Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| I think one of the points that we need to make is, yes, KTSC is funded by tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:48| And it is a not-for-profit organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| But as a friend of mine likes to say about not-for-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| we try not to confuse our tax status with our business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| I can say as chairman of the board, we run KTSC like it was a business, like it was a for-profit business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:11| like we are a sales organization out selling a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| Our product is Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| That's all we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| And, you know, there are lots of different philosophies about how you run a sales and marketing organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| I think you can do it by going out and having a minimal staff and spending a lot on advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| That model works for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| Obviously Hamilton County believes that model works for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| because they spend the major portion of their resources on advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:50| I can tell you that if we did that in Knox County, we would not get very good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| The other thing that hadn't been said about that comparison is the Chattanooga Convention and Visitors Bureau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| gets virtually 100 percent of their tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| So they're taking 100 percent of their tax collections, and they're just duplicating that result every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| We're taking 45 percent of the tax collections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| and we're getting the same result, basically, that Hamilton County is for spending 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| Our choice in running our business as a sales and marketing organization is to make that investment in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| And if you've ever been a part of an organization that that's their philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:40| there's a high-pressure person at the top that's pushing those people to get that result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| In our organization, Gloria is that person that's pushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| She's guaranteed her base salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| If she doesn't produce, she doesn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| And I'm going to suggest to you that in looking at hotel-motel taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| if we want to say the UT football season is the constant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| then we can count on $800,000 of hotel-motel tax collections a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:14| The rest of it comes from what this fantastic staff goes out and produces, and that starts at zero every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| So you have to have some way to incentivize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| And, you know, we're talking about Gloria's pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| We have a lot of other people at KTSC that are incentivized on the same basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| And the track record is that has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| When I sat down with Gloria to negotiate her contract, she wanted more base salary than what I was willing to give her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6579)|
| 1:49:47| But what I did, I turned it around and I said, well, Gloria, I'm willing to go further than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:54| if you can actually produce the dollars in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| And our track record proves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:05| I think that's all, Chairman, for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| I just wanted to make some comments, you know, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| I don't have any quibbles at all with the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| You don't have to do a sales talk on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| I think you get good results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| You know, watching, you know, Gloria Ray work over the past couple of years to get back to the sports analogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| I think we probably have the Michael Jordan of tourism promotion working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| And, I mean, she's a great, enthusiastic person who's a leader who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| who brings a lot to the job that obviously can motivate people that are around her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:46| And I really don't want to get into the issue about the amount of the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| I will say that the reason I think it got some people's attention was because it's due to taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| And I don't want to repeat anything that Ed says because I share, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| much of why this came to attention for the same reasons he mentioned, because it's tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| The one issue that I think might be worth looking at that I've heard from people who aren't even saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:14| whether the salary and the compensation is too much or not too much deals with the composition of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| There's 23 members on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| I believe that five are appointed by the county or the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| There's two from the city, four from, you know, I know you told me three, but when I add it up, I get 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6688)|
| 1:51:36| Because I thought there was two from the city, four of community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| and 12 that were appointed by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| What did I miss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| Okay, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| So there's three rather than four organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| But the point I'm trying to make with this, that those numbers aren't important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| is that the majority of the board is appointed by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| And that's where I would have some issue, particularly because we're dealing with county tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| Do we need to look at the composition of the board, particularly for accountability back to the county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6725)|
| 1:52:13| and possibly the city government since ultimately these are tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:19| and have maybe a more open process even within the board because when I talked to two of the board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6739)|
| 1:52:25| they had no idea what the compensation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| And I agree with you, Mr. Duncan, when you said earlier that generally the executive committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| or some sort of subcommittees work on compensation because the couple of boards that I've worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6753)|
| 1:52:41| one of which dealt with salaries in the seven digit figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| is that we did have a compensation board that looked at that, but we did report back to our own board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| where they knew the numbers and voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| And that might be the only thing that I would suggest is that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| since this is 100 percent tax dollars that's coming into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| is we need to have more representation coming from the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| which basically represents the people rather than it coming internally from those 12 members that forms the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| Commissioner Briggs, I might just tell you that as we have looked at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:25| executive compensation has become more complicated for not-for-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| And we've made changes in Gloria's contract based on the IRS rules governing compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6810)|
| 1:53:37| I have felt like that it has become a complicated enough issue that we needed a committee that actually deals with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| So we now have a compensation committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| As we move into the future, that will be instead of the chairman of the board sitting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| and working with it and negotiating it out and carrying it back to the executive committee for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| and to make the decision, there are five members on that executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| The compensation committee will be dealing with those issues and doing the negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| and bringing that information back to the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:11| You know, if we do have a failure in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| it's not bringing all of the specific details of it back to the full board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6854)|
| 1:54:21| I don't mean this as an excuse, but you've sort of seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| somebody said they didn't bring their book bag to the earlier meeting today because we had so much information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:33| It's Commissioner Olinby, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| You know, we're dealing with that as a board also because we do try to stay on top of everything that's going on with KTSC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:44| I will tell you that the 12 at-large members, even though that's what would be called a self-perpetuating board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:52| a great deal of thought and research goes into who those members should be as they represent the players in the tourism industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6892)|
| 1:55:04| We try to find people that are knowledgeable of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| people that represent segments of the community that are not represented either by the governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| or the organizational relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| It's not something that we just go out and, you know, find our friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| or people that are going to support Gloria to sit on the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| So we do take that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| But compensation is a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| And I do agree that, you know, maybe we just need to sit down at the board meeting and say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| this year Gloria's compensation is going to be X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| We may have failed in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| I know Commissioner Norman sits on our board, is a very engaged member of our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6944)|
| 1:55:55| Maybe we don't give them a full set of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6955)|
| 1:55:57| The budget is presented for full board approval, but it is a summary of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| The operations committee that deals with finances has sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| and they have talked about every line item of what goes into the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| So there is a review by at least a portion of the board of directors charged with that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| One of the things we try to do is to assure the board members that we have an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| and a half board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| I mean, I start getting dirty looks when we start running beyond the appointed hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| So to get all of the information in, again, that's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| It's just the reality of what we deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| And, you know, we will take this to heart as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:40| I think we will be more open in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| I felt like we were open in the process before because everything financially is reported on our 990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| That's open and available for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| All of our records and all of the details of everything we do are open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| and available to the board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| So I do thank you and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| And we will take that to heart as we move into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| I want to recognize Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| And after that, commissioners, if we could go ahead and have an end to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| We need about a 30-minute break before we hit 6 o'clock because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| we've got a couple of issues there that make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| And I just want us to make sure we've got our legs straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| So, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| I want everybody to go have something to eat before 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| When your blood sugar drops, you're not as happy and you don't make as good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7052)|
| 1:57:37| A couple of things that I do want to say is and to add about the comments about women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7057)|
| 1:57:45| And as the only female member of this board, I think it's important to be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7065)|
| 1:57:52| When you have never been part of a minority group, it's not as easy to recognize these sorts of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| slights or patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| But when you have experienced being part of a minority group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| and I know Sam will back me up on this, those things become a lot more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7084)|
| 1:58:11| I think it's important to point out, and one of the reasons that I brought this up was because there are a lot of 501C3s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:18| that have contracts with the county and that receive our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| There are some of those that have smaller budgets than the KTSC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:27| but whose CEOs have a higher base salary than what Gloria gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7107)|
| 1:58:36| And there are some of those who don't have any board members who get tax dollars from the county and from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| but don't have any board members who are appointed by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:48| So I think that those are things that we need to take to heart as we look at this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:58| We have high standards, hopefully for all of our organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| but I feel like there is something related to this that is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7144)|
| 1:59:12| and you may not hear someone say, it's not okay for a woman to make that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| Those kinds of comments may not be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| but look at the patterns and at what we are looking at here and compare it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| Are we hauling up the male CEOs of other nonprofits that make a higher base salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7165)|
| 1:59:32| and get county money and asking them to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| or having a two-day exposé in the local paper on what they make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7176)|
| 1:59:41| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| And I don't think it's entirely related to gender, but I think there is a component to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| and I want everyone to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| Commissioner Smith has asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Oh, Commissioner Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| Before we adjourn, can we just go to a general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| I just want to say something to a meeting we scheduled for three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7197)|
| 2:00:02| We had a pension board meeting this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| and we're, Knox County taxpayers, looking at an additional $8.3 to $9 million contribution to the pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7205)|
| 2:00:15| And in light of that, in light of Commissioner Hammond suggesting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| we're having a special pension workshop on February the 21st at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7219)|
| 2:00:25| So I hope other members of the commission, in addition to the pension board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| can be sure and put that on their calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Let me add that that will follow the workshop meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| It's something everybody should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| The regularly scheduled workshop, which is a day late because of a holiday, because of President's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| And Commissioner Smith has asked to address commission, but I have three things here, housekeeping items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| I'm going to pass out the agenda for our workshop Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| We're going to get started promptly Friday at 5, and then we will be adjourned Saturday after the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7250)|
| 2:00:57| But we have a pretty aggressive session, and so I'm glad that all of you will be attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| All of the school board members will be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Lieutenant McIntyre will be there, and I believe the mayor's office will be represented as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| So the other thing I would like to mention to you is we're in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| If any of you have any suggestions on the commission budget, I would like to hear those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| I'll be bringing it up at the chairman's lunch next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| Also, we're in the process of evaluating our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| If any of you have anything that you'd like to share with me before I sit down with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| and do their evaluation, please let me know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| And I believe that's what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| If you don't pass these out, Joe Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| And Commissioner Smith, he had asked for the opportunity to speak to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| I just want to backtrack just here for a quick second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| I was just blown away by what was said by our register of deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| Nobody comes to this meeting and will openly lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Dr. Briggs and I did do a TV show on the we taped it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| and I was accused of being a liar of what my figures were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| So Joe Lee got on that real quick for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| Joe Lee, I appreciate you helping with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| We got the number for Hamilton County, trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| But what started, Amy, I got a phone call during the break from one of your constituents and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7331)|
| 2:02:16| Mr. Smith, maybe it was from Hamlin County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| And I said, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| So I called Hamilton County first, and I contacted that individual, Mr. Bill Hollander,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| and he said, yes, Ms. Witt did call him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| And then I did not talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| I said, well, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| And I said, by the way, do you pay anything for these continuing education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| He says, no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| See, she didn't tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Second part, I went and called Hamlin County, and John Baskett answered the phone, the trustee up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7363)|
| 2:02:51| And he said, yes, I'm the one that called you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| So I just missed Hamilton, caught it from out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| But it was from Hamlin County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| And he said, yes, they do pay $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| So I wasn't, I didn't think it was very professional, the way it was handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7382)|
| 2:03:06| and the tone and attitude that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| And, you know, I say, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| But I don't normally would knowingly come to this body, nor would anybody else here knowingly come to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| and say things that weren't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| And, Amy, I thank your constituent for just saying, hey, why don't you try to call Hamlin County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| That's where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| It is 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Let's take a 30-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| And we'll come back at 6 o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:43| Hey, guys, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Of our Knox County Commission meeting for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7430)|

| 2:03:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7439)|
| 2:04:00| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7444)|
| 2:04:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:11| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:12| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Do we want to make additions or deletions to these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7457)|
| 2:04:18| Yes, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| What I would like to do is on the billboard ordinance that came up, that was presented by the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| And absolutely, to be fair to both sides, they've not had a chance to prepare for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| This is something that's very big if we're going to ban new billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| And I think that we need to have some public hearings on this to let both sides explain their why they believe one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7478)|
| 2:04:47| or the other and also allow the public to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Since this was sponsored by the Metropolitan Planning Commission, I know that Mark has had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| is out on family matters right now, and I think it would be good to have him here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| So I would like to make a motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7503)|
| 2:05:08| Are you saying that we would need to have a public hearing in between that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| I think we probably should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Can I make a substitute motion to do 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Well, I'll tell you what, I'll withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| We'll make it 60 days then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| The motion on the floor is to defer for 60 days, and it's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7521)|
| 2:05:25| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| I agree with Commissioner Andrews' substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| I was going to ask was 30 days going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| But I guess in the interim, what I'd like to understand is how has other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom120123part2?start=7535)|
