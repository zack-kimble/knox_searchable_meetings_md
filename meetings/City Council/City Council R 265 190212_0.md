| 0:02:49| regarding the Police Advisory Review Committee. And so at this time I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| the procedure is to add it to the agenda at this time and then it'll be, it'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=174)|

| 0:03:40| City staff and me for a half-day budget retreat on Friday morning. This was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| important because it was just a mere, I don't know how many hours, after your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=226)|

| 0:10:12| you. Thank you. Thank you, Council. We'll move on now to resolutions. 11A is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=612)|

| 0:10:24| Council's condolences to his family upon the occasion of his passing. Move for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| approval. Second. So, Council, we're very fortunate to have Ashley's family here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| with us tonight. I'd like to invite Sue and the family to come up and to stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=638)|

| 0:10:59| And if I'm not mistaken, we have a police officer there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=659)|
| 0:11:07| Councilman Steyer. Thank you, Mayor. Yes, this is an honor resolution honoring the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| memory of Curtis Ben Ashley Jr., also known as Gentle Ben. I won't read all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=673)|
| 0:11:21| the resolutions, but some of the highlights. He served in the Senate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| distinction and honor for almost 30 years, spanned six different governors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| was very active in the community, and really served the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| with distinction and honor. I think it's especially important to honor his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| memory at this time, and political discourse has gotten to the state it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=704)|
| 0:11:51| in. As a reminder, it doesn't have to be like that, and Senator Ashley was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| someone that was liked by all. He was respected by both sides. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| was not only respected, he was liked by both sides. He was a workhorse. He| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| wasn't a show horse, and he really understood the concept. Just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| someone is your opponent on one issue doesn't necessarily mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| they're your enemy. On the next issue, they may be your ally. I'm so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| thankful the family's here, and I'm pleased to bring this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| forward. I would now turn it over, if you had any words for Council. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| like to thank each and every one of you. Ben would be so proud, but I can hear him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| saying I was only doing my job. This is my beautiful family that I love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| dearly, and everybody else loves them too, when you get to know them. I hate it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Cindy could not be here, our daughter. She is trying to take, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| think, one of these little bugs that are going around. So I thank you again, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=784)|
| 0:13:11| really appreciate that very much. Right, and how long were you all married? 68| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| years. Wow. All my life. Well, thank you so much, and we certainly know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=798)|
| 0:13:30| public service, especially trips to Nashville, is a whole sacrifice by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| family, especially when the legislature is in session. So thank you so much for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| your service, and for coming tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=819)|
| 0:13:55| So Council, we have a motion and a second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| The ayes have it, and so ordered. Again, thank you to the Atchley family. We so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| appreciate Senator Ben Atchley. 11B is a resolution expressing support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| House Bill 71 and Senate Bill 181 as they pertain to Zoo Knoxville. Move for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| approval. Second. Councilwoman St. Chris. Hi. I'd like to discuss this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| I don't think it's necessary to have beer at the zoo. I think that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| certain places where it's family-oriented, and it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| alcohol-free. They're talking to a lot of the recovery community. That's a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| where they take people after rehab to try to get them back into society, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| how to move in this world. And, you know, the zoo was always one of the safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| places. So to me, it's not necessary, except for a financial decision, which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| you know, half of we're spending so much time and energy on addiction issues, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| then we bring beer into a place that's family-centered area. So I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| excited about this. Thank you. Councilman Wallace. Thank you, Mayor. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| Lisa New is here tonight. I guess not. Yeah, she's right here. Good. She'd come up and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| kind of address that, and you saw her. Thank you. Lisa, please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and address for the record. Lisa New. I'm with Zoo Knoxville, president, CEO, and my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| address is 5509 Green Valley, 37914. So this came about because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| requires state ordinance or state resolution to change the law on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| this that allows zoo to be able to serve beer, and we came aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| and Rick Staples and Senator Massey are both carrying this bill on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| behalf, and they asked if, you know, they would like to have a resolution from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| council. We're not approving it tonight. We're just saying that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| supporting the resolution. So anyway, answer just whatever, how you got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| and why we're supporting it and trying to support the zoo. Sure, and I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| opportunity to talk about it tonight. Councilwoman St. Perez, you're correct in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| that it is partly a financial decision. The zoo generates 86% of its own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| revenues, so this is obviously of interest to us, partly as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=986)|
| 0:16:31| revenue opportunity. This is a request that we get quite frequently from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| guests to be able to have an alcoholic beverage in our restaurants and cafes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=997)|
| 0:16:44| that, we have a new cafe that will open in March and April, and so we saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| opportunity to be able to offer this as an amenity to our guests in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| confines of where it's sold. So the intent is not to be able to walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| the zoo and partake in alcoholic beverage while you're, you know, in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| those spaces, but for it to be confined at our restaurants and cafes and food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| stands. And I can tell you that it is at other zoos and aquariums across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1032)|
| 0:17:21| country, and it doesn't seem to ever have caused any issue. It is a high retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1041)|
| 0:17:28| price point, so it doesn't tend to be one that is abused or manipulated. And in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| looking at other venues in town, for instance, the Tennessee Theater, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| talking to the staff there, they serve alcoholic beverage even when they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| family-friendly events. It hasn't caused an issue. So that is the reason behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| It is for fundraising. We already serve alcoholic beverages after hours with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| limited special event permits, and this would just allow us to do it in our food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| stands and new restaurant. Well, and financial is important. I mean, we, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| city, invested $10 million just a few years ago in the zoo, and I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| single largest contribution to date, and I think it's important. We got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| help you help us sustain yourself, and I think that's an important piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| not to be overlooked, but that's why, you know, we brought it forward and why I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| support it. Thank you for coming out. Thank you, Councilwoman McKenzie. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| finances are very important, and I love the zoo, so I want it to remain. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| what's more important to me are respecting our families and our values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| and what we teach children, that you don't need to have beer to have a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| time. Why does it need to be in every single venue? So that's why I feel it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| just simply unnecessary. I respect your opinion for that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| Councilwoman McKenzie. Thank you. And so, Ms. New, I want to be very clear. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| actually would be confined to restaurant and cafe only, so there would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| food stands that would be selling beer or alcoholic beverages outside of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| two parameters? If it were, our intent would be at food stands where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| seating areas around it. The restaurant and the cafe, but there is another venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| in the Center Zoo that also has outdoor seating only, but we mean in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| confines of that space. So it wouldn't be allowed to be take a beer and walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| through the zoo. It would be in the confines of those places where food is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| sold. Okay, so the center section of the zoo is corded off to some degree, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| it's not just an open space where kids will just freely walk. You know, a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I'm not sitting out where there are kids and I'm drinking a beer or an alcoholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| beverage. Yes. Okay, and carting would be done, correct? Absolutely, and we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| third-party food vendor that handles that and does that in other venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| including stadiums, zoos, and aquariums all throughout the country. Okay, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| you. Councilwoman Ryder. So, Ms. New, just to clarify, the area there around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| corner from the penguins, is that what you mean when you say in the center of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| the zoo? There's a food vending there attached to? There is with indoor seating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| It has indoor seating and outdoor areas too. Okay, so you intend to sell there as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| well? Anywhere, yes. Our intent was anywhere that you could buy food and sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| down, that you could have that on the menu. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| Woman Welch. Thank you, Mayor. Just a process question. So, my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| we're just voting on a resolution to support a change in Tennessee Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| annotated, which will actually be, that will have to be considered by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| legislature. So, assuming, so that we're just voting to support that. If that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| passes, then the zoo, I assume, would have to come back for a beer permit. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| there's, this is just a support. Right, this is a request from the board of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| zoo to council to show support for this legislation, which is in Nashville. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| you. Councilwoman. I think it's that the Knoxville Zoo requested that Rick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1274)|
| 0:21:21| Staples and Becky Massey bring this to the state level. So, I think it's just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| council on what we feel if we're supporting it as well. Right, right. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| originated from the board of the zoo. Right. Okay, so I think we all understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| what we're voting on. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Me. One no. All right, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| passes eight to one. Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. Eleventh C is the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| authorizing the mayor to award $3,000 in neighborhood small grants program funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| to support community building activities planned by Edgewood Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Neighborhood Association. Move for approval. Second. I believe we have members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| Neighborhood Association here. Would you please stand? I believe we have Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| Durr, Renee Dudley, and is Amy Hathaway here? Hi. Thank you all for being here. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| appreciate the work you do to improve your neighborhood. Thank you. So, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| ordered. Eleventh D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| easement agreement to allow proposed building elements to encroach into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| public right-of-way for Sevier Avenue. Move to approve. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1355)|
| 0:22:44| ordered. Eleventh E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| number C-18-0244 with Rogers Group Incorporated for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| 2018 resurfacing project increasing the contract amount by six hundred twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| three thousand one hundred sixty four dollars three cents for a new contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| total of nine million sixteen thousand forty eight dollars six cents. Move for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| approval. Second. Councilman Wallace. Thank you. Jim, I just want to get a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| of clarification, explanation on this. So, since the contract was signed, the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| of asphalt has gone up by more than five percent. Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city. It's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| gone up more than five percent twice under the current contract. So, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1409)|
| 0:23:35| already seen this once, at least once before, maybe twice, but it was going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| pretty steadily for the last, I don't know, since December 17 or so, December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1421)|
| 0:23:55| 2017, and it looks like it has peaked out in about December 2018. So, every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1435)|
| 0:24:04| it goes up five percent. We'll go back and correct, or if it goes down five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| percent, we'll go back and correct. So, there was one note in there that, if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| understood it right, so, and I didn't understand it right, that's why I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| asking. So, there was 70, it was 70, started out the 76,728 tons, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| actually supposed to be 69,000. So, is that price adjustment already been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Well, I don't really understand that. Are you looking at a particular line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| Yeah, on the notes on page 55, the justification, it says item 1010-D is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1474)|
| 0:24:43| being adjusted to reflect their production and the original bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| quantities. Yeah, the original bid, the, this was sort of complicated. There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1486)|
| 0:24:58| little clerical error that got carried through for a couple of iterations on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| this. It didn't make any difference in the final price, but that's why there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| little bit of a confusing note at the end of this, because it was sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| confusing situation, but it was a, it was a, it was a clerical error that we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| correct at the end that didn't really make any difference, but it needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| documented. I don't know if that helps. Yeah, you, well, that's what I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| understand it, because I read, I mean, the reduction of quantities reduced the total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| bid 8.3 million by 644,000 for a revised bid of 7.7 million. So the revised bid was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1534)|
| 0:25:44| carried through, but the quantity did not get adjusted in the paperwork, so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| showed the wrong quantity. But showed the right price. The right price, correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| So, okay. The slightly confusing clerical error that doesn't really matter in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| price in the end. I'm justified in my confusion. Yeah, I was confused also when I, when I saw this, and I had to, I had to have a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| discussion about it. Thank you. So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered. 11F is a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| authorizing the mayor to enter into a license agreement with the state of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Tennessee for advanced traffic management system upgrades along Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Pike, Broadway, and Chapman Highway. Move for approval. Second. We have a motion and, oh, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1590)|
| 0:26:36| Councilman Starr. Thank you, Mayor. I was just, was gonna ask Mr. Hagerman to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| explain a little bit about the advanced traffic management system and that, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| upgrade, and what, what, what we can expect, I think. Broadway, Chapman, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Kingston are obviously some of our streets with the worst traffic, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| what, what might we expect with these upgrades? Well, it's about, excuse me, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1613)|
| 0:27:03| have about a 15 million dollar budget, something like that, for these three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| corridors to mostly upgrade, update existing hardware that's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| corridors, and also add communication capabilities. We'll be, we'll be adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| fiber connections. The project has gone a little slower than we expected because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| those fiber connections kind of ran into a complex of changing rules that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1648)|
| 0:27:37| been changing as we go, and we're working out processes with KUB. TVA has decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| to be more active in, in regulating connections, and we're competing with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| whole bunch of communications companies for spaces on the poles, so, so that got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| carried, that, but bottom line is we're upgrading cabinets, we're updating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| communication, the, the, and communication is a big part of it because the, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| intersections can communicate with each other and stay in sync, and they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| communicate back to the people in the office so that they don't have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| for somebody to tell them that something's broken, which is the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| is now. So what is the, the timeline going forward, and once it's installed, will we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| notice, do you think people will notice a difference in terms of? It's, they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| notice a difference in reliability. There will be an improvement in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| efficiency, but it's the kind of thing that you can see, I mean, there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| performance measures that we'll be looking at, but it's not necessarily the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| kind of thing that will be obvious to the, the user, but it's in, in total, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| some, there, there's a lot of efficiencies to be gained. In terms of the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| going forward? Timeline, we hope to start construction this summer, and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1739)|
| 0:29:09| sure how long it'll take, six months, nine months, something like that, but the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| there's a lot of, well, the, the cable goes up pretty fast. It's the, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1752)|
| 0:29:20| hardware and the synchronization of the, the, the re-synchronization of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| There will be some, I can talk about this too for far, far longer than you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| to hear, but did that answer your question? Yes. Councilwoman Ryder. I'll just ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| quick question, Mr. Hagerman. We've had lengthy conversations about this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| the Broadway Corridor Task Force has been very on top of and in tune with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| this project going in and how fast, because that's one of the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| that's affected. So when you say six months for the rollout once ground is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| broken, you don't mean for all corridors, do you? Because there's Kingston, Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Broadway, and Chapman. I'm not actually taking a shot in the dark at how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| it will take, and I probably shouldn't even have said six months. I know. It may take a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| longer than that. I don't want anybody in my neck of woods to hear that if it's not true. Once we get to, once we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| construction, I mean, it's not, it's not major construction. We're not pouring a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| lot of concrete. We're not bulldozing a bunch of area. It's, it's changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| sometimes it's changing out boxes, just the boxes themselves, sometimes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| contents of the boxes. It's, it's not, I mean, construction, it's, it's not heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| construction. It should go pretty quickly. Okay. But the Broadway Corridor is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| some of the, the most troublesome hardware is, so you will notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| differences there. It will be much more stable. Okay, thanks. All right, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| ordered. 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| Knox County acting on behalf of the Knox County Sheriff's Office for the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| of two surplus pickup trucks. Move for approval. Second. We have two people lined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| up to speak. First, Julie, tell me how to pronounce your last name. Julie, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| you and your name. GoTro. GoTro. GoTro. GoTro. GoTro. That's right. Julie. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| Everybody. Please state your name and address. Yes, Julie GoTro, 1100 Liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| Street, Knoxville, 37919. I'm a public defender. I'm here to talk about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| resolution and I have written my remarks because I know my time is limited and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| would like to thank the council and the mayor for listening to me. I refer, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| printed off the lease contract and I refer to language in the paragraph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| called background wherein it says the City of Knoxville Public Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| Department routinely utilizes the services of KCSO inmate labor for work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| projects within the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Referring to the portion of the contract under recitals, quote, lessee provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| inmate labor for a myriad of city projects each year at no cost to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| city. The city might be inclined to inquire before approving this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1942)|
| 0:32:32| or for entering into it to inquire about the terms of employment for inmate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| workers and I would like the city to consider some factors so that you fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| understand the moral issues involved. Number one, the county does not pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| inmates for their work so the county saves money by exploiting inmate workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| at the detention facility for the work that they do. It would be easy for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| county to pay them because all of the inmates have jail accounts from which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| the sheriff extracts money that has been deposited on their behalf by family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| and friends and money which they had when they came into custody. I'd also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| like to point out that most of the inmates at the detention facility are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| pre-trial. In other words, they've not been convicted of anything yet. Some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| them are serving out probation violation sentences for misdemeanors. After they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| perform their free labor out of your trucks for the city's $2 a year, they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| back to a jail where they have to pay for commissary items such as hygiene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| products and underwear not provided to them. Medical and dental services are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| taken out of their commissary accounts before they can get anything else such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| as hygiene products or communication with their families and that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| third thing they have to pay exorbitant fees for communicating with loved ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and I think many of you may be familiar with that issue. It's been in the news. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| won't go into it a lot here but I will point out that last fall County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Commission, and I stood right here and addressed County Commission on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| issue in fact, accepted a quarter million dollar bonus from Securus Technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| which is a giant global corporation that basically just installs technology for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| prisons communications and this is because money is being made off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2065)|
| 0:34:36| these workers and their families for the communications that they have with each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| other. They have no other means to communicate. So basically what you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2079)|
| 0:34:43| are these work crews going out working a lot and these guys like women like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| get the work but they need to be paid for it because when they get back they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| have to pay for soap and shampoo and talking to their kids. They should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2094)|
| 0:35:06| paid for their work and by essentially giving the sheriff these trucks you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| helping to exploit them and this is slave labor and I don't think that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| city of Knoxville should endorse that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2114)|
| 0:35:23| Person to speak do you want to respond now? I'm sorry. Okay the other person is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Charles Barber. Mr. Barber please state your name and address for the record and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| if you watch the timer up above here you have up to five minutes. Thank you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| you. My name is Charles Barber. My address is 4733 Briarley Drive, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| 37921. As someone who is trying to become a better more active citizen I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| speaking to the City Council for the first time tonight. I was born and raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| in Knoxville but I've lived about 15 of my 69 years in other cities and states. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| have noticed both ways that we are unique and ways that we participate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| other American localities in certain trends of society. We are simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| special and we're not special. Specifically tonight I'm addressing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| seemingly simple superficially simple resolution proposal of whether the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| should renew the 11g contract to lease trucks to transport labor crews from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| county jail. The question I have is when are we going to start stop when are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| going to stop supporting a system of indentured servitude? During the Black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| History Month I have deepened my interest in and study of human servitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| I've been going to classes reading books. Many people might agree that slavery is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| an extreme form of servitude yet one dictionary definition that I found is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| that slavery is a condition compared to that of a slave in respect to exhausting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| labor or restricted freedom. Since many of the county inmates are held with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| delayed trials or simply because they cannot afford bail and the reasons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Julie just outlined forcing them to work looks to me like a form of slavery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| Never mind that some of them volunteer to work on the city crews apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| just so they can have a day away from jail as I understand it. The terrible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| conditions in the county jail which the inmates are escaping for a few hours are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| of course a separate issue that is not in the purview of Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| The issue before you is whether the city will continue to collude if you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| with a system that is practicing a form of slavery. This question is far from as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| simple as leasing trucks. A powerful lesson I have learned in my studies this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| month is that the established organisms of power such as city council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| city and county governments have for many decades passively and sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| unintentionally perpetuated bigoted practices that harm minority classes. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| have deliberately not inquired what the actual racial mix of Knox County jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| inmates is because this is not fundamentally a race issue just as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| not fundamentally a truck issue. It is an issue of oppression of materially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| unfortunate people. Certainly across the country we know that this is sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| described as a racial issue. By voting against 11G you of course cannot solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| this massive social problem but by noticing and discussing the complexity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| of the issue and admitting to the harm being done to those less fortunate than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| yourselves you can begin to turn the tide of mindless oppression that is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| too easy to ignore. The great majority of Americans if asked would surely speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| against slavery and indentured servitude but what I have learned is that most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| us with privilege due by our inactions and willful ignorance perpetuate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| conditions that would horrify us if we stopped to imagine how we would feel on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| the other side of the situation. We all know that conditions in the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| jail are terrible as Julie described. I am asking you to consider whether your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2350)|

| 0:39:21| indirectly supporting something that is so unfair to so many. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you sir. Councilman, I mean Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| Mayor, I would like for somebody from the administration, Charles, perhaps to address some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| issues raised here. This seemed on the face of it very simple to me. There's more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| complexity to it than I'm aware of. Right, David Brace can respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| It may bounce over to Mr. Swanson as well. So yes, the city does have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| utilize inmates in partnership with the Sheriff's Department. My understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| that those individuals volunteer for the work outside of the jail. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| community service projects in neighborhoods, oftentimes removing brush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| cleaning up parks in neighborhoods, litter removal and other activities. Many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| of the cemeteries in our community, some of the historic cemeteries, don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| in perpetuity a system for maintenance and so the the inmate crews have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| utilized in those types of situations. It has also been in many ways, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| think Council probably knows this, we have a program in public service where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| we help folks that are coming out of the jail system. We have a program, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| second chances program, so our service managers actually help in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| promote some of that to the sheriff crews so they're aware of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| We've had several people go through that. Chad Waith is here, service director. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| obviously we care about the condition and the work environment for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| workers. During that day activity they do, they're provided a lunch by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| and then the equipment and the vehicles help. Typically they help transport not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| the inmates themselves but they help transport tools and weed eaters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| those types of things. So it has been a very effective program for services out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| the community. I can reach out to you, you raised some issues, I don't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| reaching out to the sheriff and discussing some of the issues you raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| in the working conditions and more than willing to do that Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| Councilwoman Ryder. Could I ask Mr. With or Mr. Brace, whoever wants to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| it, about the second chance program. How many participants we've had, have we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| folks that have gone directly from any of these volunteer, if we want to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| them that, I realize that's the point of contention for many of these work crews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I have been on a ride along with some of the public service crews and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| did the one that I happened to go along with, which I don't want to speak out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| turn, I believe citizens can do if they sign a form, but I was able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| someone, one of the people working on that crew was with the second chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| program or had been hired on through that. So I actually met someone who's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| success of that. So could you elaborate on that some? Sure, Chad West, City Public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Service Director. Yeah, our second chance program runs basically through some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| community partners. So while I wouldn't say we've hired anyone that's working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| our, with the inmate crew, our community service crews directly, we can refer them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2556)|
| 0:42:42| and some of them have been referred to several partners that we use, Salvation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| Army, Connect Ministries, CARM, Handout for Women, just to name a few of them. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| once they go through those communities, they are then referred to us for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| program. We have had, quote me on the exact number, I believe 15 people go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| through the program. We've hired five of them. There's still currently three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| employees that went through our second chance program that have, are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| working today and have been very successful. Okay. I don't know if, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I'll let my colleagues ask questions at this time. Thanks. Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Councilwoman Sincres. My concern is about, I don't remember the numbers, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| about more than half of the people who are in the Knox County Jail have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2605)|
| 0:43:33| been convicted yet. They're still in there for money bond. So, I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| understand the statement about that they are given the choice on whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| want to work or not. But if I am kept because I don't have the money to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| out and my choice is to stay in a dank cell or to get out and work, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| really giving somebody a choice. It's saying pick the better of two bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| choices. So that's my concern. It does look on the surface like a very small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| issue, but I think some of the larger issues, you know, of mass incarceration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| they're so big it's really hard to get a handle on it. But it's places like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| where we can start working on it. Could I add just one more thing? I'm sorry. One| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| thing that they do get, most of them do get a day for the work that they perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So while they're not given monetary values that was mentioned, they are given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| like a, and another thing I don't know, so it's something we can check on as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| whether they have been convicted or not, but most of them do get a day for time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| served. So if they work in the community, that is two days on their sentence. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| you're sentenced for, let's do easy math, if you're sentenced for 12 months and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| you'd work for six months, you would be able to get out early. And we can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| that up with, I mean there were some valid issues raised about toiletries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| shampoo. Maybe there's a way for our program or some of our providers we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| with. The Second Chances program was was really part of a broader equity analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| for disparities within public service in our community and how we hire and who we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| hire. And so those are valid issues and we'd love to reach out, Chad and I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| reach out to Sheriff Spangler and have that discussion and look into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| issues of who is actually on the cruise and dig a little deeper. Wonderful. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Councilwoman McKenzie. Thank you. So I agree that this has opened our eyes to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| bigger potential issue than we, this body, can solve as these are Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| inmates. But I do want to make sure that we are all aware that most people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| are incarcerated are already disenfranchised. The fact that they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| not have a lot of support system where people are giving them money to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| to get toiletry items and those types of things. Most of them are arrested with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| nothing and leave with nothing. And so I think this is a broader issue that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| appreciate uh Mr Bray saying that he will have further conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| Sheriff Spangler. I'd like to be included in that as well because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| nothing less I think that there needs to be some type of stipend for these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| who volunteer as Councilwoman Perez said who's incarcerated that wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| volunteer to get a day out of jail out of a box. And so I would like for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| explore this on a on a larger scale. So I think simply on that on that fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| alone I will not be you know approving you know voting for this today just as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| statement of that. Yeah I'd like to say based on this conversation and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| issues thank you for raising them and the conversation with Council. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| recommend that Council someone move to postpone this for two weeks. We can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| you some additional information answer some of these questions. If you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| other questions get them to us and okay and then we'll try and answer some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| these questions. I'd like to move to postpone this two weeks. Okay we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| postponement you second okay so we're gonna postpone two weeks get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=2826)|

| 0:50:13| last Friday at the budget meeting and I think that we continue to approve things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| for the Tenova site and yet you know I still have a lot of concerns and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| the problem is we keep approving things little by little and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| engineering and even though this one doesn't have but a $15,000 price tag on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3033)|

| 0:51:04| current safety building is moving quite at that speed and so I just I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| there's just a word of caution that we talked about as 40 million dollars has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| been allocated for this. We talked about decreasing our revenue. We talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| increasing expenses. We talked about a flattening out of our economy and and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| think we continue to try to approve this thing a little by little and eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| the pot is going to boil and I just I think it's just I'm just saying that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| cautious and I don't know that this thing needs to continue to proceed quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| as fast as it is. If you don't have the attraction and the reason to move from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| the Clayton project where I haven't we haven't seen that agreement there hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| been seemingly a lot of movement on that agreement or wasn't much reported out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| last Friday. I'm just not sure that this is you know are still the best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3118)|
| 0:52:03| going forward and I think that there's certainly been some information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| We've got to get in scene we're gonna see the building I think next week or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| week after next and there's still a lot of concern and I don't I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| it's just a current block approval that's coming down with this and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| whether whether we approve it's really not much money to approve this as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| district as in a redevelopment district but there's still a lot of concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| it and I don't I just think I mean I could easily see postponing it for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| while until we see what the development of the Clayton project is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| and whether that's going to happen or not and whether because I don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| any other considerations have been considered I mean if they're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| to take that site should it be rebuilt there or is it is that the best use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| our 40 million and I think I have great concerns about renovating a building on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| a budget of 40 million when I know renovations always run more expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| and are harder to predict so as a word of caution I just you know we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| open that up for discussion and and talk a little bit about it or that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| comments. Dr. Lyons. Yeah I can respond to some of that Councilman Wallace. First| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| this is this request is for the redevelopment area and the even if by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| if it turned out for some reason and we are obviously wanting to move ahead on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| the Tenova site but even if that somehow did not work out that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| leave that area in such a state that the redevelopment area would would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| absolutely be a desirable thing to have there that is you would have buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| that were not in use and then you would want to get to what opportunities would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| be in the future and what a redevelopment area does is really fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| limited to be our property even if we're not our property it allows mainly for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| the use of some tools like tax increment financing use of a facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| grants through our through our community development department so we see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| redevelopment area is something that is definitely a plus to have for the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| development portion of the project were it to go ahead and but on the other hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| we see it is probably even more desirable for the area to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| redevelopment area if we didn't have the KPD opportunity there because then we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| be looking at a an abandoned and blighted set of structures I might also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| add that from our point of view and others can and mr. brace may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| speak to this our pursuit of a site for KPD is somewhat independent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| museum we were always intending on doing that that was that's something we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| been moving ahead it really in exactly this way I think it's safe to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| without the presence of the Science Museum that does enter the equation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| some degree when we talk about timing and whether there needs to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| temporary place for the Science Museum we hope we can get around that and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| not be necessary but the pursuit of this site is needed been badly needed by KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| and then again just to conclude the redevelopment area whether that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| or not we see that as essential for giving putting some tools in place for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| allowed to the area to to be protected you know I like it that it would be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| redevelopment district I think it may even held st. Mary's or to Nova market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| that property I mean you know that they haven't that would certainly be a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| tool for them and it's not that I mean my concerns are that you know the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| back in the development business and we have we bought two properties since I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| been on Council the state Supreme Court site and Jackson Avenue that we still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| that we've yet to just redevelop and you know the state Supreme Court site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| continues to be delayed Jackson Avenue we don't have a plan for that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| going to get another property a piece of property out here to develop and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| know that's I mean it's just not really I'm still not convinced that that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| best use of you know what the city ought to do and I think it ought to be it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| could be a redevelopment it certainly could be a redevelopment district you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| could help to Nova sell that property to a private developer as well who would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| have thought and I didn't think I'll just say that that Baptist Hospital site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| would would get turned into what it's turned into and that it was sold and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| private developer bought it you can say well it's on the river and it's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| other and it does but you know that to Nova has other that they have good good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| attributes on that site as well I don't think the city is the last great hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| that that this site it would ever be developed and I think it's no you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| have to look any further than the Baptist Hospital side to say yeah that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| can happen and we think there's still so many unbearables on on the to Nova side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| that we don't know right then we just do to respond to the last question were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| remain in private hands and I can't see the city's purchasing it if without you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| know without the plan of putting the safety facilities there were to remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| in private hands then this redevelopment area would be absolutely essential as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| say so we really can't see a downside I guess to having the redevelopment there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| we could see it in aiding either private development on the whole site or on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| back part as we've we noted if we go ahead and put the KPD KFD courts on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| front side and and for that I'm that's why I'm willing to support it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| cost much it's 15,000 and it would it could help to Nova in the future market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| that site if we don't end up taking it but thank you there's still a lot and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| think that's for me it's important to say as we go along that that I still got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| real concerns about that whether this is still going to be in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| of the city and I think you go go back to Friday and Jim York's explanation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3465)|
| 0:57:50| where we are financially you know that there's that's just we've got concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3470)|
| 0:57:56| and this council and this city is going to have to deal with these increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| expenses and decreasing revenues of how and where those lines are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| intersect and what our plan is to either avoid them or you know work around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| so but I support support the development I just think it's important to have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| conversation so thank you thank you councilwoman Ryder I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| that I agree with some of councilman Wallace's sentiments I feel like I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| scheduled to tour this week and I feel like there's still a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| I don't know haven't not physically been through that property in a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| time and to to see what we're actually talking about you know you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| been the eyes on the ground and I haven't these are not decisions that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| take lightly and this weighs very heavily on me we're making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| here that takes the city in a particular direction for decades and but I I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3526)|
| 0:58:54| for my tours of KPD's current facility know that that building is woefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| inadequate and so you know what we're struggling with is cleaning up the mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| that was left behind that is going to become a burden on a neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| for those who haven't driven by recently I mean granted they've done everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| they can to board it up and fence it up that's not attractive pretty or nice for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| a neighborhood and it could be a turning point for the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| that greatly concerns me I have a question because I didn't ask this at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| the workshop we had with to Nova we are getting queries of course from folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| seem convinced that the VA somehow was going to go there I have reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| congressman Burchett to try and get information on that and he has not found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| anything to come back with me on tenable actual results on that whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| that did or didn't happen or what the story is behind that I think what a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| of the public doesn't know and what I understand and I need you to confirm for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| me is that to Nova has marketed this property for four years so who have they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| marketed it to what response that they got who came and saw it who said no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| and ran away screaming what is the reality since I haven't been there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| walk through it I need to understand better what you've seen and what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| know from them my understanding is that they have had very little interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| the property but obviously they've been working on the details of what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| would be doing with the site the hospital closure we are not aware of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| desire by the VA to put a facility in at that location I think it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| important to note that one of the reasons the key reasons to Nova is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| leaving the site is the inefficiency of the hospital facilities the you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| you've got you know the old and historic and then you have the next building in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| the next building and the inefficiency of that site is one reason that one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| the key reasons they're leaving that location based on the information they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| provided dr. Lyons and I and so I would I would be hard-pressed to believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| the VA would want to step in to an inefficient facility and attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| renovate it so but we're not aware of any of that if if if people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| information about that please let us know but I think that is a bit of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| rumor but if there's information we would definitely look into that and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| look forward I've given so far I think five or five or six tours I was with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| Oakwood Lincoln Park dr. Lyons and I were there Monday night with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| executive committee councilwoman Welch councilwoman Singh Perez and so I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| forward obviously to finishing those tours and having more dialogue these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| these complicated redevelopment projects oftentimes that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| does move down a path and so I understand that there's some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and and we'll continue to relay information we want to dig into that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| well and make sure that we're making a good decision I can assure you that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| mayor wants to do that as well on our team and so we'll continue to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| and part of hiring Benefield Rectors was to do that first bit of due diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| the uses and the square footage does it fit and then the second question was is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| it in budget you know at the 30,000 foot level Volkert engineering our owners rep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| is now on board and one of their primary task was to review again does it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| and is it in budget the KPD piece KPD KFD pension city court and so Volkert has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3741)|
| 1:02:27| done that work so I have some confidence on the public safety aspects of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| reuse of that property the north end the redevelopment end I think there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| real strong desire to see something happen there and for that to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| the market but we'll continue to flesh that out and I look forward to to tours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| with each of you over the coming weeks so approving this the agenda item that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| before us right this moment what will that do what will KCDC do and did you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| something similar abroad but back Baptist there the situations are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| different we have a tax increment financing district that was placed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| around the entire South waterfront and we did not know that Baptist was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| to become available for private developments it happened before Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| closed yes well it happened before Baptist was sold I'm not sure whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| it closed or not okay and in this is what this resolution only thing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| does is is gives the formal approval of council to go ahead for KCC KCDC to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3806)|
| 1:03:35| ahead and start a process and that will involve public public hearing public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| meeting to establish a redevelopment area in the area right around the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| Tenova site and and include slightly some other areas such as long woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| that could benefit from the past from the from the things that at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| redevelopment area provides so there would be a public hearing then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| would come back to council the redevelopment plan would come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| council and you would have to vote for it this this is not a legally required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| step we think it's this important step to have to have us to have KCDC's know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| that to have council aware that KCDC is pursuing this process and have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| public aware of that before they start okay councilwoman McKenzie last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| question prop hopefully so let's say by some chance that the city does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| purchase Tenova that a private investor comes in and purchase Tenova what will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| that then do if we approve this to be a KCDC redevelopment plan would a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| investor be liable to you know go along with whatever recommendations or plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| KCDC came up with or would this just be 15 you know money that we've thrown away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| in the event that a private investor were to we are somewhat captive of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| language that's used legally that's called a plan the plan doesn't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| amount to a blueprint it amounts to a set of principles having to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| revitalization of an area to give you an example we have a we have redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| areas along North Central already in downtown and in the Magnolia warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| district and what these do is provide some possible a set of available tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| that a private developer can make use of the main one is tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| if somebody wanted to come into this project a private developer it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| to be very difficult to make this work this would allow them to apply for a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| and make them eligible for a TIF it also would make them eligible for facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| grants and we you know that have been very valuable as you know and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| community development has established the you know being in a redevelopment as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| a prerequisite for getting a facade grant so it just gives some possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| for private development if we go in that direction it really doesn't preclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| anything okay thank you councilwoman Singh Perez I was trying to follow there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3950)|
| 1:05:59| still could be a chance that we do not purchase it but another developer does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| yeah I think it's important to know that there's no slam dunks here we are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| working through the due diligence City Council would still have to approve any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| type of purchase and sale agreement the pilot and so that that's not in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| yet so we are still completing due diligence we're still bringing the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| together that would need to work with police and fire regardless of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| location and we're still working through negotiations with Tenova and CHS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| the parent company of Tenova so those agreements have to come before City's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| Council before anything would move forward and there's no there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| assumption here that that's a slam dunk we feel confident that we with with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| south side we feel confident that that is a good location and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| preliminary budget analysis looks good for KPD and KFD they've been through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| property they feel comfortable with it I think there are broader questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| about the north campus the expenses with the north campus and again about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4018)|
| 1:07:05| negotiating with Tenova so for some if this doesn't go through then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| still be in private hands and a private developer could step in I believe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| think it would be very difficult to do that but yes I think the simplest way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| summarize it would be this if we if the site does the but the KPD KFD facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| does go there we still would need this for the back half to help because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| will go into private hands and we would like to have that capacity to assist a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| developer for whatever that might be mixed-use housing the other that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| be something that we would spend a lot of time discussion involving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| community involving council so the set of tools would be there for the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| half if it goes through and for the whole site if for somehow it did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| because that site is going to need the benefits of being at a redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| area it's almost a classic example of a site that almost begs for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| redevelopment area because that's that's the set of tools the states provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| a blighted for a blighted site the two pieces that we've already think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| council approved a couple months ago you were saying like is this the right space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| I forgot who the who we contracted with so we contracted with Benefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| Rectors so when the opportunity came to the city we needed someone to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| look at the facility and so we hired Benefield Rectors Glen Rectors Glen had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| actually been the project manager on the public works complex so we understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| city needs he understood city facilities he came in to look at programming so use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4113)|
| 1:08:40| types so what does KPD KFD what are the uses and then square footage needs how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| much office space how much space for you know for storage how much record storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| and so he took you square footage and he made sure that it applied to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| existing buildings you know we've got an existing building with an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| parking deck does it work that's the first question and then if it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| what's the budget so can we afford it it may work but we can't afford it and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| those were the two preliminary questions that Benefield Rectors looked at and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| you had the report we provided it to you it's online at the workshop Volkert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| engineering is on board it's essentially our team the experts who are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| manage this project and keep it in budget and wake up every single day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| thinking about it and so Volkert engineering is on board they actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| went to their one of their head offices in Franklin Tennessee with Glen Rectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| and reviewed every bit of his programming and then did their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| analysis with their experts to see okay was Glen right and they actually came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| just a little bit under Glen with a 10% contingency so they came back and said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| this project the KPD KFD not the north redevelopment comes in at 42 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| with a 10% contingency so that that's the budget plus 10% and so that work has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| been done and you approved both of those contracts do you recall how much those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| contracts were the I mean a ballpark here the owner's rep is is is about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4203)|
| 1:10:11| million three and I can get you those exact numbers the Glen Rectors contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| was 25,000 or less I'm looking back at Jim it was a 25,000 or less I can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4216)|
| 1:10:24| you those exact numbers though so very kind of minimal work on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| hourly work with Benefield Rectors and then Volkert's with us they're soup to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| nuts on this project regardless of the location they're they're here with us I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| got to tour today and it was very informative there are a lot of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| plans for different portions of the the city government it was very interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| to see but my concern is very much like Councilman Wallace that we're approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| in bits and pieces we're already in for a dollar are we going to continue this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| that is my concern so I wanted to know what piece is KCDC doing at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| yeah so the KCDC piece is $15,000 and I look in the back of the room Ben Bentley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| is there from KCDC this resolution is asking Ben to start the process for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| redevelopment area so that $15,000 I think Dr. Lyons has said regardless of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| whether or not this comes to the city or not the redevelopment effort would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| important for the site regardless I would also say the Volkert contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| there with this project the need for KPD KFD court and pension there with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| project throughout regardless of the site the the contract with Biddefield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Richter's if it wasn't this site there would be that $20,000 that we did on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| analysis and I'll get you the exact number that if it wasn't this site then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| you're right it would not be I guess it would be dollars that could could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| been used somewhere else and I might add to the bulk of the 15,000 is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| advertising to let people be aware and reaching out to folks that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| redevelopment plan is taking place I also want to make the point that on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| project this large you have to do it in phases you have to do it in steps these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4318)|
| 1:12:02| first two contracts that you approved are part of the due diligence you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| before we move forward and say yes and ask you all to approve the you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| purchase of this this property we need to know we needed that first phase with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| Benefield Richter's and then having the consultants on with Volkert in place so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| those are critical stages and this is very common with the large you know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| don't want to jump in and say it's our spot without having without having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| kind of due diligence done first so we have to bring it to you I'd love to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| bring you one big thing and say that's it and let's go but this is part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| due diligence that's required in order to be for us to be certain that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| bringing you the right location at the right cost and and that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| that'll work. Councilwoman McKenzie. And Mayor let me add that in the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| Tenova does not pan out to be the site and we select another site we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| start that process of due diligence over again and pay someone to come in and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| be able to assess the site. Exactly. For feasibility. Right. Okay good discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| so this is just to tell KCDC to start planning for the redevelopment plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| that area that's what we're voting on now we have a motion and a second all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. 11-0 is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4400)|

| 1:13:37| all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Oh I'm sorry Councilwoman I didn't see your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| light on. I'm sorry. Do you want to speak to this? I do I do. Michelle Hamel from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| CBID is here. Hi Michelle I have a concern that I just wanted you to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4429)|
| 1:13:59| able to speak to. I hear a lot of people get very upset that we put so much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| and attention into downtown and that you know this budget is being increased this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| year and then you and I spoke a little bit about where is the money coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| if you wouldn't mind talking about that. Sure thank you. Let's start Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| Hamel 17 Market Square and thank you for the opportunity to come talk about it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| CBID's assessments or revenues are derived by those people who own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| within the downtown area. So at the beginning CBID was created in 93 and 51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| percent of property owners and 67 percent of representatives who with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| property value agreed to assess themselves. So they were paying City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| County and then on top of that agreed to pay an additional assessment of CBID or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| we take those dollars and leverage them back into the downtown organization. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| as downtown has been developed and redeveloped or we're seeing additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| revenues coming in so we see an increase in revenues on this year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| budget of what two hundred and six thousand. That shows last year there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| an appraisal year from County Assessor's Office so this is that done every three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| years four years. I can't remember the schedule for which it's done and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| there was an overall increase in property values in downtown. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| additional money does not derive from the city but actually from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| who own property within the downtown area as their property was appraised at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| a higher value that was the increase we've seen of that. And as an example I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| had sent an email out earlier when I first in 2000 the boundaries of the bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4545)|
| 1:15:53| originally were assessed or appraised from the city at two hundred and twelve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| million and then in 2018 at the end of 2018 it's jumped up to nine hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| sixteen million. So like CBID where we're seeing the increase the city is seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| the increase as well if that makes sense. And you know from our organizational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| standpoint we appreciate the attention into the downtown area. I know you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| years ago there was a nine counties one vision and there was a big input of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| wanting to see downtown's redevelopment. I know that that was ranked number one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| from the whole regional project and seeing a redeveloped downtown for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| just our community but not just for Knoxville but also for our region. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| there's been a lot of resources put into that and also I think that and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| want to speak to the city for the mayor or anything else but I think two points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| of you can see where there's been an increase in the taxes from property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4609)|
| 1:16:55| taxes going back to the city so there's not a need to raise taxes from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4615)|
| 1:17:01| standpoint I think that you know that's a benefit to the city. And then also too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| if you look at our retail sales tax in the downtown area we track those and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| we're seeing some great increases in the last two years we've seen double-digit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| growth from that and also in the last five years downtown has exceeded the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| city as a whole which goes back to as a benefit to the city. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| there's this feeling that resources are being taken from other communities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| being put into downtown but what you're saying is that there's an additional tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| that downtown residents are paying and so they're paying for their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| improvements in that area. Right so that's where our money comes from from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| the CDID standpoint or from property owners. You know the city is obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| putting significant increases in infrastructure in other areas in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| downtown and really led the way to see private development then come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4669)|
| 1:17:54| afterwards. Thank you. And I would add what we did the the public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| improvements downtown are the similar to what now you see on Central and on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| we did on Cumberland and what we're doing on Magnolia. So we we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| public infrastructure which then catalyzes the private investment but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| this particular item that you're voting on it's exactly as you said it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| additional taxes basically that are paid by the property owners additional fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| that they assess themselves to this those who are within the CBID in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| to then invest back where their properties are. I might add one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| that the they have the CBID board is the group that votes on how those those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| monies are spent. So it's just people who live downtown or own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4720)|
| 1:18:44| downtown to pay extra and that money goes and the board of people elected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4724)|
| 1:18:48| those folks decides how that money is spent it it's very helpful to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| because it does things that we general taxpayers don't have to support. And on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| side note our chair is here Tim Hill and also see Rick Emmett he's on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| board as well so. Any other questions? Any other questions? Just in I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| say I'm really excited about the piece of education that you guys are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| be doing with the restauranteurs on Market Square about race relations. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| you. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much. Good discussion. So we have a I'm gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| vote on this again just to be sure. We had a motion and a second. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| Michelle. 11 Q is the resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| respectfully requesting that the members of the Knox County legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| delegation support the efforts of boards similar to the City of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| long-standing Police Advisory Review Committee by opposing legislation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| would negatively affect local government boards. Councilman Stair. Thank you Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4788)|
| 1:19:55| and thank you members of Council for for putting this on as emergency. As a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| background of how this came up the City of Nashville actually threw a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| referendum by the voters voted to to create a basically a Police Advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| Review Committee there in Nashville and some members of the legislature have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| responded by introducing legislation to sort of weaken the power of that body by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| affecting its ability to issue subpoenas and in doing so it also affects the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| Police Advisory Park the Police Advisory Review Committee here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4829)|
| 1:20:34| Knoxville which has been in existence for over 20 years and you know to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| it's just a very important place a very important role in community police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| relations. I think during my time on council across the country we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| community police relations deteriorate and I feel like Park has played a vital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| role in helping maintain those relations here in Knoxville and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| legislation affecting it essentially weakening that body I think is a serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| issue and that's why I brought it before this body and brought it on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| reading so I would certainly appreciate the approval and Mr. Vaughn did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| any additional comments on this is on what's going on in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4875)|
| 1:21:27| First I want to say good evening Clarence Vaughn Executive Director for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| the Police Advisory and Review Committee. Thank you Councilman Starr and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| Council and Mayor for allowing this matter to be discussed. I know I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| spoken with quite a few of you in regards to what's taking place. Park has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| provided a committed service to the City of Knoxville for over 20 years and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| also have been very involved throughout the state throughout the country really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| being a part of a national organization to speak on matters of civilian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| oversight which is important to key issues to cities. Recently about two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| weeks ago myself and our director for community relations also our lieutenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| Jerry Armstrong from the Knoxville Police Department and our board chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Rosa Mar was visiting Chattanooga but we spoke to Chattanooga City Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| council members or County Commission members about the importance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| civilian oversight about how we can engage and have better connection with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| our police environment. So I thank you again for bringing this topic up it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| very important that it will impact us statewide if House Bill 658 is passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| so that would affect us when it comes to how we engage or how we interact but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| we're thankful here in Knoxville that we never had to use our subpoena power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| because of our relationship with the Knoxville Police Department. Without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| relationship would make it difficult so I want to thank Chief and her team or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| command staff for continuing to keep that relationship strong. Right, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| you. Chief, did you have any comments to add in addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| Nothing other than we do have a great working relationship and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| the legislation proposed really does it would deteriorate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| relationship but it does it would affect how business is done and I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| it's needed and things are working great right now and we're doing a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| with the ordinance we have so I fully support this resolution. Okay, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| so much and I think it was a great point Mr. Vaughn made that you know they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| had the subpoena power but it hasn't been abused in any way and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| hasn't been used but it's it's important that it's there to allow that body to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| function properly so I would appreciate the support. Thank you. Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| McKenzie. Thank you and thank you Mr. Vaughn you and your staff for the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| that you do. You answered my question because I was going to ask if Park has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| ever had to use the subpoena power option and you said that you have not. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| can say that in the past I have attended meetings the prior chief where it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| been highly contestant you know the conversation and the investigative piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| of that particular issue and so the fact that you had full cooperation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| the police department from KPD and I know that you have that same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| relationship with Chief Thomas I think speaks volumes but it is good to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| that in the event that Park were to need that authoritative piece to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| subpoena that you have it at will to be able to serve the community and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| people who you serve and so I will be in favor of this. Thank you. Thank you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| council I would like to say we're pleased with this resolution encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| you to support it I think you all saw the statement that I made last week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| we sent to to our delegation and that we've shared with the the sponsor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| legislation and the speaker of the house that we are opposed to anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5079)|
| 1:24:46| would reduce the current powers and structure of Park because it has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| so well so effectively we have a good relationship nothing's broken so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5092)|

| 1:28:24| Heritage and I'm here in opposition to the proposed boundary we certainly are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| in favor of a medical boundary in our neighborhood but we don't support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5312)|
| 1:28:39| one that's before you tonight because of the inclusion of two historic properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| within that boundary these are two houses located on White Avenue that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| currently very well maintained and in good shape they're currently protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| by an NC1 overlay and they're also contributing structures as far as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| designation as a National Historic District so our concern is losing those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| properties and as you know we lost four properties earlier about six months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5350)|
| 1:29:16| we're just concerned about the number of historic contributing properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| specifically that we tend to lose a lot of in Fort Sanders so may I just ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5360)|
| 1:29:32| a clarification you're representing the neighborhood organization in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| yes because I received an email from Todd Morgan saying that Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| did vote to to support it is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| yeah yes please Mr. Morgan I'm just looking at the email just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| verify because I've received an email yes no we had worked with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| neighborhood Association and Covenant on moving toward a plan for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| neighborhood so we do support a medical district plan and we even support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| one that's there it's just we want to be sure that we're drawing attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| the two historic properties right which you did in that letter right so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| not implying that it's okay necessarily to just dismiss those properties but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| do support the district thank you okay yeah so I guess to clarify we I mean the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| neighborhood Association also we do want this district or this boundary to to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| happen we've been working with the hospital on it but our major concern are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| these again these two houses and I don't think anyone has the exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| but we're incredibly concerned about the number of contributing structures that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| we have in Fort Sanders and the possibility of losing our status as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| recognized historic district so I think the I mean I can't I'm not speaking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| behalf of Knox Heritage but there was concern there is concern among board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5456)|
| 1:31:01| members of Knox Heritage and there was it was brought up to ask for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| postponement this evening so that we could there could be further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| on the subject but my main goal tonight is just to be on the record saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| the neighborhood Association is not in support of including a hospital boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| that you know without a doubt agrees to the demolition of two contributing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5481)|
| 1:31:29| structures okay thank you and and again to reiterate mr. Morgan he said that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| board voted formally to reiterate their support to the establishment of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| medical district but that this does not that they are strong let's see how does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| he say this so that this that their support for the district does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| indicated a support for the demolishing or of the structures is that fair to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| right thank you okay so what we're voting on tonight is the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| district itself yes and my concern is that I believe it's the hospital's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| part of their plan in this medical district is to demolish those houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| that's where they want to put their patient pavilion so on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| neighborhood Association we feel like passing this boundary just solidifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| that that those houses would be destroyed all right thank you ma'am thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| you okay next us lined up to speak is mr. Birmingham Patrick Birmingham from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5552)|
| 1:32:39| the hospital please write your name and address for the record sure Patrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5559)|

| 1:32:47| two you know what you've heard and I think I've spoken to most of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| individually I mean the medical district was something that was we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| partner with both Knox heritage and with the neighborhood Association and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| were asked and we also included East Tennessee Children's Hospital in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| process of trying to define a boundary of where we would keep our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| as we looked out for the next 15 to 20 years and this is the boundary that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| that we created the specific properties that that Adrian was referring to on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5595)|
| 1:33:21| White Avenue are part of the area that they're adjacent to a parking lot that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| we own and as part of our long-term master plan that we've been you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| working on for a number of years that is the the next place to go and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| part of this to understand is the investment that we've already made in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| the facilities there at Fort Sanders the camp building the development we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| doing right now is 115 million dollars the next logical step would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5626)|
| 1:33:52| building of a new patient tower and it would require us to put four parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| decks below ground so you can imagine if you notch out that that entire parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| lot if it's not squared off you lose about 15% of the building going up but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| you'd also have an issue with you know how would you route the parking decks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| that are down below if you're taking out that corner I understand this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| difficult situation regarding the historical houses and part of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| just an issue with covenant health of the facility that's down there Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5663)|

| 1:34:51| that back in 2016 when we looked at a company called Dixon Hughes Goodman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5691)|
| 1:34:56| actually did a strategic study of not only where we were but all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| health care providers that are within the East Tennessee region based on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| we had our architects come up with a master plan and that's what we've really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| been working on I know it was discussed already tonight in relationship to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| Physicians Regional or the old st. Mary's Hospital but for centers regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5716)|

| 1:35:25| hospital are 60 years old and there's just no way to be able to update them we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| have a responsibility we feel about helping to provide for quality health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| care in this community and the only way we're going to be able to do that is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| be able to upgrade and improve the facilities that we have we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| find ourselves in Fort Sanders similar to a situation that Tenova found with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| Physicians Regional and that's part of the reason that you know we're moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| forward this medical district was kind of our promise to both the community the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| neighborhood and Knox Heritage that we would basically handcuff ourselves that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| any future development would be within that boundary and that we would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| really be able to do it unless we came back before MPC and came back before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| this governing body to allow us to do it so we're basically capping ourselves of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| where we're going to be for the next 15 to 20 years and unfortunately the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| does call for that area that does have two houses on it certainly covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| would be you know very agreeable to help like we did in the past in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| moving the houses or whatever we require if when we acquire the houses or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| those structures we certainly wouldn't board them up we would keep them in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| same purpose that they're using right now until the time comes that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| need to build a new patient tower and the truth matter is we don't know when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| that is that could be in five years it could be in seven years but we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| keep those structures in their current use until the time that we needed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5813)|

| 1:37:16| are voting tonight on a medical district and you've heard that described I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| very well the idea is that first of all the hospital can plan for how this very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| complicated medical facility can provide high quality efficient medical care for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5849)|
| 1:37:34| our region it allows them the ability to do that and it also is intended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| provide insurance to the surrounding neighborhood around sort of the cutoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| line for encroachment that I think has been a concern for a very long time so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| that's the issue that we're voting on tonight however I understand there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| more to it than that this is a very complicated neighborhood and there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| lot of interrelationship between the hospitals the neighborhood UT the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| hospitals been in that neighborhood for a hundred years and over that time there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| have been 40 plans that have been generated 40 plans and studies I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5888)|
| 1:38:15| not read through all of them but based on the titles of those plans and studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| I can tell you that in the majority of them there's a reference made to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| hospital this is not a new issue and sort of the struggle and the conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| between the hospital and a very important neighborhood have been ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| so it's not it's not an easy vote I mean it's not as simple as a medical district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| and I have had it's not an easy vote for me so I'm gonna say that and part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| that is because we have neighborhood groups and particularly a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5924)|
| 1:38:51| organization with a small number of volunteers and this is really because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| it's a neighborhood that over time has faced degradation encroachment and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| are a lot of owner-occupied or long-term residents remaining in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| neighborhood so it's a small group of very dedicated people who have put tens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| of thousands of hours over their tenure in the neighborhood into improving you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| know an important neighborhood for our community so there's a huge amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5961)|
| 1:39:27| disappointment and concern and I think probably a little bit of feeling of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5967)|
| 1:39:36| know there's just a lot of emotion I think around this when you've put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| much time into it and so I appreciate that and saying that I appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| really doesn't mean a whole lot because I haven't lived through all of that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| is all very understandable I can only make my decision based on what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5992)|
| 1:39:58| experienced over the past year and what we have in front of us today and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| the past year what I have experienced is that covenant the Knox heritage and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6003)|
| 1:40:10| historic Fort Sanders neighborhood association have met multiple times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| had what I believe were very well-intended conversations about how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6014)|
| 1:40:21| coexist there were several items that were identified that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| wanted Knox heritage asked for the hospital was willing to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6027)|
| 1:40:35| on and none of them have been perfect so there's been compromise with every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| single one of them on both sides I would say so the first one was around the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| houses that were moved from the property that has been a very long process there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6044)|
| 1:40:51| were four structures for a parking garage that is contributing to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| hospital's overall operations and the hospital wanted to remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| conservation overlay for that that was that's what they wanted to do that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| have made it a lot easier for the hospital they agreed to leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| conservation overlay in place and to allow that to go through the process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| make sure the design was not something that everybody was thrilled with but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| that it met the guidelines for the conservation district again compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| the city worked with property owners and the hospital and the neighborhood and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| Knox heritage to move two of the houses so I think that was a second compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| if I had to guess probably would have been easier for Covenant to just tear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| those houses down and I'm glad that they didn't an archaeological study was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| conducted on the site and there was a significant amount of reluctance around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| doing that but not only was it conducted but Covenant actually paid for it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6113)|
| 1:41:58| have that archaeological study done and then the last thing was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| establishment of a defined medical district which is before us today and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| that original boundary actually included seven or eight houses on Forest Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| that a request was made to remove those houses from the boundary and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| houses have been removed from the boundary so you know again not a perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| solution and now what we have left is two houses on White Avenue that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| significant and Todd Morgan and Knox heritage along with Jack Neely did some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| research on those and there is significance to those houses for sure so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| all of that is definitely something that I'm keeping in my mind and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| but on the balance we have two vacant hospital campuses in our community right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| now health care is an exceptionally complicated industry I feel like after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| having some pretty heated conversations with the Covenant architect and with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| Birmingham about you know why aren't you using this surface parking lot and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| aren't you moving it over here and have you considered this and we had multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| conversations about that it became very apparent to me that what Covenant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| trying to do is to survive and to provide efficient high quality health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| care for our community and for our region and that is really what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6204)|
| 1:43:29| tipping the balance for me in thinking about my vote and I support the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| as it's written but I also support making sure that our city continues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| pay attention to a neighborhood that is really critical both based on history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| and location and so that is something I'm committed to and just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| continue to remind our city that city administration how important the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| neighborhood is to our community thank you for being patient with me while I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| said all of that I appreciate thank you for all the work you've put into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| councilwoman Ryder I'd like to ask miss Webster when she became aware when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| neighborhood became I think I pushed my own button when the neighborhood became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| aware that those two parcels were included in the boundary because I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| think you my understanding from conversations is you weren't aware when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| it went to MPC that those two parcels were part of the boundary we I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| remember when we met help it was it was it was before MPC but Mr. Birmingham and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6272)|
| 1:44:42| met and when I pointed out the two houses on white as well as the houses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| forest and I think at that point he made it pretty clear that he might could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| something with the houses on forest but not the ones on white but I didn't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| the final proposal until maybe three days before it went to MPC and I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| I did not respond to him the the medical district as drawn to and I'm confirming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| what Adrian said has basically been the same since it really goes back but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| certainly for the last year January of 18 it's the same medical district when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| met with each one of you that we had shown with the exception of the the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| change we made before it went before MPC which was to remove those those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| structures the houses that front Forest Avenue but as I've explained that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6327)|
| 1:45:35| area with the parking lot across Clinch Street and the way we've drawn it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| always been you know where we need the medical district to be I mean that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| really the issue I do understand from the neighborhood Association and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| concern about you know about the houses you know but I can't you know I can't I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| mean the investment that we when we go to make make that build that patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| tower it'll probably be a 500 million dollar investment and we just you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| we need every square inch of it you can't knock out 15% of the area that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| want to build it on because when you build that tower from past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| conversations let me make sure I'm clear when you build that tower that's when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| you have the pieces in place to then go back and demolish the old hospital part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| so then you'll have vacant parcels in the center of the campus that's exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| for redevelopment opportunities you mentioned children's or others yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| right so we demolished these houses so we can demolish this part so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| build over here and trust me I understand health care I live it it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6392)|
| 1:46:37| how I pay my bills at home it's you know in and out of Children's Hospital my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| child has had every specialist there so I know that area and I've spent a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| time there so I understand that and I appreciate you working with it my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| problem with this is this is a 15-year boundary not a long-term boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| that's how you described it to me there have been boundaries before that went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| back I do also really appreciate the conversation I don't mean to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6423)|
| 1:47:07| chastising about you guys recognize the mistake in the past of demolition by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| neglect I have hard feelings against demolition by neglect and I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| to hold them back not against you guys particularly but everyone lost some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| structures in my own district last week because of that that's why the city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| the Jackson Avenue parcels that we're saddled with is demolition by neglect so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6448)|
| 1:47:33| I appreciate the conversation you have with me that once you guys acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| those two houses that you wouldn't board them up and have them vacated and go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| demolition by neglect I would be more in favor of continued conversations with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| you in the neighborhood I guess my question is what's the rush to us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| vote on this tonight for you guys not to have continued conversations to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| about you talked about those houses being able to be moved and why that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6473)|
| 1:47:59| conversation can't continue to talk about what the plan is for that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| here's the thing we tell neighborhoods to go out when there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| neighborhoods right now in the works to try and work on getting an NC1 so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| can protect their neighborhoods and my neighbors I wasn't there they did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| before me they worked really hard they failed the first time and they succeeded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6496)|
| 1:48:20| the second time to get preservation when I vote for this I am indeed voting not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| tonight but I am in voting I'm putting a nail in the coffin to vote to remove and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| repeal the NC1 even if we say it's in place it was for the parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| that's approval and review of a parking garage I mean Secretary of Interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| Standards review of a parking garage I'm not even gonna go there I feel like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| neighborhood has been asked to bleed a little bit they bled a little bit for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| those other houses Tennessee you know UT moved those other houses now it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| two more this is to get us to the 15-year mark and that's going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| little more and I understand the importance of health care I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| the ER waits I understand the importance of getting people attended to for stroke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6541)|
| 1:49:06| care etc but I just feel like there's a little bit more that can be done to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6546)|
| 1:49:13| a conversation because when we say we pass yes on this we say NC1 sure you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| have that neighborhood you can work your tails off and get that passed or you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| work your tails off and not get it passed and and not have it but once you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| get it if you get it then if somebody decides it's in their way then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| going to get repealed wink wink nod nod so I just I don't feel okay with it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| so I can't support that personally I can't speak for my colleagues but I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| don't feel good about it and I understand what your needs are I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| understand what your mission are I understand that it's a multi multi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| million dollar business and I understand the crunch that health care is in but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| want more wind for the neighborhood that has been eaten up and eaten up and eaten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| up when we're turning to other neighborhoods and saying yeah get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| yourself an NC1 because when it's inconvenient we'll roll it back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| things can be demolished. Thank you councilman go ahead do you want to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| Yeah Councilman Ryder and I appreciate that you know I think that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| genesis behind why the medical district is because it was one of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| the Neighborhood Association asked for is is their frustration when's this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| going to stop and so that was the reason we put the medical district in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| place to ask and I know I said you know we're forecasting out but as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| understand it even though this is added to the sector plan the one-year plan if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| we wanted to do any development even if it's 18 years or 20 years from now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| would have to come back before MPC and come back before this governing body and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| we'd have to justify why we would be doing it outside of that. I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| that anything you would do in the future would still have to come back to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| body or some other body for rezoning if you're tearing down things that are over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| a certain number of years old there's going to be a stay on the permit so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| mean there's a couple of triggers in place it's just this is not a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| boundary and the trade-off is the the neighborhood gets to roll out NC1 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| then when I have neighbors who say and I told you this when we met I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| neighbors who say well I don't want an H1 on my house either it got put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| place before I was here repeal that you got to why don't they get to and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6683)|
| 1:51:28| that's where I'm troubled and I have problems with it and they don't get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| because they're not multi-million dollar businesses but that's my struggle I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| understand you know it's yes Covenant's a very large organization but I do want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6698)|
| 1:51:44| to say we're a nonprofit organization I mean and and our commitment is to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| community about health care and I understand when the NC1 was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| in 2000 but who would have forecasted that we would be in the landscape that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| we are now with two major you know health medical centers that have closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| so it is a changing dynamic and I understand that about doing it it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| it's it's not like the hospital it just you know grew up there in the 50s or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| something we've been there a hundred years so we've kind of lived along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| this struggle I think what with this proposal and the medical district is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| say that yes there are two houses affected but basically we're handcuffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| ourselves as well as East Hennessy Children's Hospital for no more and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| was the the promise we made particularly they didn't want us to be going east of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| 18th Street and we agreed to that again I know it's not a perfect situation I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| just being very honest with you and Frank about you know we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| some some some real concerns from a community-wide health situation about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| are we going to meet the needs we're trying to deal with that right now I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| mean there was you know approximately 36,000 ED patients a year that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| still going to the physicians regional they shut that thing down in 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| okay and us and UT are dealing with that right now and we just don't want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| that happen and we're as an organization we're trying to do is work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| community work with the neighborhood work with a you know Knox heritage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| plan out and say this is what we think we're gonna need this is and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| agreeing to put a boundary on it to say we will develop inside that boundary but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6796)|
| 1:53:22| there has to be a give-and-take we have to be able to meet the needs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| community from a health care standpoint it can't be UT can't be the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| that's got a new hospital okay and it can't just be Park West that facility is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6810)|
| 1:53:36| really important not just about servicing the area but it services the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| entire eastern you know East Tennessee region as a referral hospital I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| you're very familiar with that so any sort of complex medical procedures have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| to be done you know are there being referred to that to that Center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| thank you councilman stair thank you I agree agree with a lot of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| member writers comments I mean I have some high heartburn on this as well you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| know when I was when I originally saw it I thought it was an agreement and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| you know it's a big sort of large area and it's a it's a sector and one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| plan and it really so I was surprised that it wasn't an agreement and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| also struck you know there's not really a rush here and I think if we do adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| it tonight I mean I think we are condemning those two properties and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| you know like councilmember writer with the the four properties on on Highland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| that gave me a lot of high heartburn because then see one overlay when it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6871)|
| 1:54:36| adopted I mean obviously the hospital was involved in that and they agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| that and you know they bought those properties knowing that they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6880)|
| 1:54:43| protected and and you know they ended up being demolished and there's you know a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| parking garage there now so you know to do this so so quickly afterwards while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| it's not an agreement I just don't don't see that so I don't know if other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| members I mean I'd be you know to postpone it for four weeks to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| perhaps that there there could be an agreement reached I think makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| especially since there's no real development plan for this for the sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6911)|
| 1:55:17| of the parcel and that's in contention for five to seven years so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| that's you know to me to me worth it you know especially given that you know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| are you know NC one overlay I guess we proved can be changed you know you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| and it's it's you know that I think that's a big deal and I think we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| take it seriously and I and this one there's there's no urgency so I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| know if councilmember Welch if you'd be open to a four-week postponement or you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| think it makes sense to to move forward tonight so would your idea be that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| the end of that four weeks if there's no agreement we would just I mean I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| I'm trying to it would come back on the council I mean it would come back as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| drafted you know so it'd be before us again and in four weeks and you might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| have another discussion like this but I mean I know you all haven't lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| through this so I guess I mean I have been at the table and I I mean I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| certainly would if that's what other members what council would like to do I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| don't I feel like there has been significant dialogue between all parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| involved and these two properties are what it's going to come down to I it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6987)|
| 1:56:36| hard for me to imagine having sat through the conversations what an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=6996)|
| 1:56:41| alternative outcome would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| well I mean I guess I'll make a motion to postpone for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7006)|
| 1:56:54| Councilman Campbell thank you mayor I just had a question now Patrick you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| own do not own these properties correct we own one of the properties and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| in the process of acquiring the other one okay I was just looking at the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| and I saw that the hospital aren't okay so you are working on purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| agreements for both of them as you're correct dealing right now okay all right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| okay first we have a yeah one of the properties we actually closed on last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| Friday and the other one we we have that the Basler property or yeah it's no it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| the other one it's the Malia property okay I just curious I mean again I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| it just because we rezone doesn't mean that unless there's some law that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| a taking eventually you know these property sellers may not want to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| and so I don't know the long-term effects but it just to me sets a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| precedent that a hospital or any entity could bully someone out of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| property if they wanted to if that's in their strategic plan and I don't mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| use that word bully strongly but I'm saying if someone wants to hold out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| doesn't want to sell and they're forced to regardless of the money and it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| seemed odd I didn't know you all didn't know them so let me just say this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| no one was bullied in terms of the properties in fact Andy Basler could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7087)|
| 1:58:11| be here tonight but I did speak to him today and if you call him he'll tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| that he's very much in favor of the establishing the metal medical district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| and he was not bullied or threatened or anything he's you know the deal that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| we're going to do he's very happy with and I think Maurice Malia would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| this the same thing and part of the agreement is to as we as I've said when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| we acquire the properties we're going to keep them in their current usage but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| know it and it may seem like councilman stair that we're rushing things but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| let's keep in mind that the history in terms of health care in this market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| that in October of 2017 to Nova said they were still going to be building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| that new hospital out on Middlebrook Pike and then in January of 2018 they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7133)|
| 1:58:58| said oh no we're not going to build that hospital but we are going to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| physicians regional open and then in October of the of last year just 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| months later they said no we're going to close it so the work that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| right now at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center we didn't originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| forecast as part of our master plan would do for another two years but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| doing it and making the investment now because we have to meet the needs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| community this isn't about us having something against historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| neighborhoods or houses this is about us stepping up and working in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7165)|
| 1:59:30| to make sure we can meet the needs so that if you get a member of your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| gets sick all right that we're going to be able to take care of you and do it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| that it doesn't look like you know some sort of MASH field hospital I mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| we want to be able to provide quality services health care is is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| there's new technologies we need to be able to do that and as I said some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| the existing parts of that hospital are 60 years old so we don't want to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7191)|
| 1:59:55| ourselves in the same situation that's going on right now in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| where st. Mary's is is doing and we're just being honest with everybody about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| what we need to do if we want to meet what the future health care needs are I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| know we're concerned about the houses but what about the people that that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| sick and I don't mean just the people here in Knoxville I'm talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| people that are around the surrounding East Tennessee counties okay if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7216)|
| 2:00:20| having a stroke or a heart attack and they go to the LeConte Medical Center in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| Sevier County and they're referred up here and we're saying well we can't take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| it because we don't have any beds for you and we don't have the ways to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7227)|
| 2:00:30| we're trying to make sure that UT is not the only hospital that's doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7230)|
| 2:00:36| and there I will tell you this there are certain procedures that are done at Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Sanders Regional Medical Center that aren't done at any of our other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| hospitals they're not done at Park West they're not done at Methodist Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| Center it is a very unique tertiary care hospital in terms of the things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7247)|
| 2:00:53| done there we're just trying to make sure that it keeps going council before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| we have more discussion we have a motion to postpone that's a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| motion I'm reminded by the law director so we actually need to take a vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| that and then if that fails we'll continue speak to the motion speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| the motion so Patrick do you think that you've exhausted your engineering and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7270)|
| 2:01:16| your site studies with you know consultants and all that you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7276)|
| 2:01:22| you've exhausted all those efforts and you've come down and that this these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| properties are are critical to the you know to the to the future building of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| Fort Sanders unfortunately yes that that that area is is the next phase of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7291)|
| 2:01:37| master plan and that is to build a new patient tower that's there that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| able to serve serves the needs the existing structure that we're improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| right now really becomes our our critical care unit where the ED is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7305)|
| 2:01:49| brand new ED in the basement then we're gonna have ICU critical care unit beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| in there eventually they may probably move the cath lab and surgery in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| and the idea is that all of those critical procedures will be done in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| that structure and then as the patient you know gets better or there it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7322)|
| 2:02:06| that serious they'll be able to move in into the regular patient so it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| question that from a site analysis standpoint that additional time is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7330)|
| 2:02:14| to be beneficial for you all to study it more you feel like you've exhausted your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| your site analysis at this point right and we're we're kind of it we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| you know we invested 70 million dollars when we originally built the camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7344)|
| 2:02:27| building and now we're putting in another 115 to 120 million dollars so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| you know we've already got a hundred ninety million dollars in it but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| all part of the master plan well if I thought four weeks was going to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7356)|
| 2:02:40| that and then you said you if you thought that and I mean you don't and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| think you still got to deal with the long term still got the houses there we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| still got a concerned neighborhood we have concerned citizens and you're gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| do your part to you know to amend that just like you did and moving those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| houses on the other street so I'm good okay are you councilwoman your lights on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| you speaking to the motion to postpone I have a quick question of mr. Birmingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| when do you anticipate breaking ground so you're you're saying you're in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| hurry so I understand I understand what happened to Nova to Nova was not a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| corporate citizen by closing in the way they did and I understand also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| hospitals in this town didn't think they were gonna close which shocks me and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| not talking about you I'll say no names okay I don't know why anybody thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7407)|
| 2:03:32| that I don't know anybody thought they were gonna build on Middlebrook there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| no room in the world for for-profit health care I got no love for that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| just don't get it but that's my piece okay when do you anticipate breaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| ground you have plans you are you aren't to engineering phase we're not it we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| not even there this is part of the master plan with there's been no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| engineering there's been no drawings it is just conceptually and that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| said I don't know what the timetable is I'd say it's at least five years it may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| be seven years it could be ten years so councilwoman Welch has seen plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7442)|
| 2:04:09| convinces her that there's no other way for you to structure your campus and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7449)|
| 2:04:13| build have you had that conversation and presented those plans and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| paradigms to the neighborhood representatives yeah all that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| understand that that has to be the block that this has to happen on we can I we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7461)|
| 2:04:29| can certainly do that we can certainly share the details of the master plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| you know with the neighborhood but part of it is the investment we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| right now in the cam building but yes we can certainly lay that out and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7477)|
| 2:04:42| you're willing to meet with us I think it's fair to meet with them to show them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| I understand that you've met with them to show them that there's no other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| to make this work right this is why we have to make this ask of you which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7489)|
| 2:04:54| not just about those houses it's what NC one means when someone works hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7494)|
| 2:04:59| pass it and I don't just mean that neighborhood it's not just about one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| neighborhood understand okay and I'm not criticizing you I just you know these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7502)|
| 2:05:07| are folks that are wounded from lots of broken promises and councilwoman Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| spoke to that and it's just lots of raw feelings and we just lost all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| houses in the initial offer from that was one house get moved and there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| lot of pushback and we got to two houses moved and we were we were hoping there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| was a possibility of three houses getting moved and that didn't happen so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| you know if we can make a better situation if you're if you're not ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| to break ground what's a four-week delay to say here's our plans this is why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| can't and if they you know there's willing dialogue and it's just no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| way and there's no other offers or ask and I guess my interest is councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| Welch has made comments or I don't remember if it was tonight or otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| about strengthening that neighborhood to solidify them for the future because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7550)|
| 2:05:58| they are encroached on from every different direction I'm interested to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| know what that is for that neighborhood and I don't mean just on your part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| you're not the only entity over there what does that look like and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| have to have that conversation tonight and then just the last question before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| we go to vote on something what are the plans for the parking lot in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| part of the middle district that you guys rent from our lease from Gordon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7578)|
| 2:06:23| Smith that includes a parcel from someone who also they weren't able to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7583)|
| 2:06:29| to the NPC meeting but the owns a house back there as well right so we don't to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| your point we don't own that lot we lease it from from Gordon Smith it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7595)|
| 2:06:39| used really for employee parking to your point the medical district does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7599)|
| 2:06:45| change any of the rights of that other property owner they don't it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| change anything about their zoning it doesn't do anything about the NC1 it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| simply the medical district was we were asked to do this by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| that's the reason why we're here the neighborhood asks for tell us where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| boundary is going to be so that we know what that what it is but it's the to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| include that area in your long-range plan is your long-range plan just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| keep leasing that as parking or do you have something in your long-range plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| for that we know at this point in time we don't actually the the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| calls for the campus to move more to where to where the new patient tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| would be and then to the point that you made is future development after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| would be able to go back and reclaim the existing parts of the of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| that we would be vacating one last question you guys did not include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| credit union and the Fort Sanders credit union and parcels in your district do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7656)|
| 2:07:43| you not own those the Covenant credit union yeah no Covenant Health does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| own that it's an independent credit unit it has the but we don't own that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7668)|
| 2:07:53| okay and there's no desire to include that in your district the need no at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| this point I mean what we've drawn there is what is our is what we're willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| commit to in terms of where the future needs will be all right counsel so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| have a motion before us to postpone for four weeks all in favor say aye aye any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil190212?start=7690)|
