| 0:00:00| Since it's the owner, I think it should be a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| He owns the business, and he's the one that's selling directly to these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5)|
| 0:00:09| and he can't go off with the excuse that he had a clerk that was too busy and they're hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=9)|
| 0:00:16| This is his livelihood, and I think he should have to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=16)|
| 0:00:19| And I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=19)|
| 0:00:20| It should be a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=20)|

| 0:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| Pay the fine, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| The officer there to your left, my right, will tell you how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=51)|

| 0:00:55| In consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| Raceway No. 67599002 Oak Ridge Highway, Hassan A. Sadiq owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=60)|
| 0:01:09| permit holders shall appear before the Knox County Board of Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| and give good cause why the beer permit should not be suspended or revoked for failing to provide a letter stating what steps are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| being taken to stop the sale of beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| As requested by the Board of Commissioners, August 24, 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| such appearance is required regardless if the letter is received prior to the date of the meeting announced herein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=86)|
| 0:01:46| You've been sworn, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Please state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Hassan Sadiq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Do you understand what the clerk just said in her report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Would you like to address this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| The letter was written and not engineered just by myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| but also with feedback from my staff to address what steps we're taking to avoid reoccurrence of the sale that took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=123)|
| 0:02:13| And it was mailed in the month of early part of the first week of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| Mr. Minot had informed me several weeks after the fact that no such letter was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| I asked Mr. Minot for the county clerk's information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| He said he suggested that I speak with Sandra at the county clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| I had called Sandra, and she had confirmed to me that there was no such letter received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| And therefore, rather than going through mailing the letter once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| I felt that faxing the letter was a more suitable alternative since it could be directly received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=164)|
| 0:02:53| Sandra provided me the fax number, and I went to the letter was already in my computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=173)|
| 0:03:00| I went to print the one basically to find the letter on my computer to print it and fax it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| And I was having computer issues at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| so I informed Sandra that it would be two or three days before I could have the computer up and running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| and then fax it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| Once my computer was fixed, we printed the letter and got the fax number once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| confirmed it, and faxed that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| The clerk who was with me during that shift when we faxed that letter is also present at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| And we had a confirmation, and therefore, I assumed that everything was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| Several weeks after that fax went through, Mr. Minard had left the notice that I was required to appear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| and I was kind of confused because I was very, very appreciative of the way my matter was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=222)|
| 0:03:49| And so it was news to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Sir, do you have copies of the letter with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Unfortunately, I had a printer malfunction, so I only have 10 copies of the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| as opposed to one for each member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Ma'am, would you just approach and bring them to me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| The letter is two pages, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| We can share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| I just want to make sure that the clerk can confirm everything that the gentleman is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| I'm not questioning that he didn't do those things, but it would be nice to know if, indeed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| you verify that he did call, that he did try to fax, and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| He did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| I called him initially to ask him about the letter because he had told Mr. Minard it had been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| So that's when we discussed him faxing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| He said, I will fax it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| And he said, I will make sure that you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| I never heard from him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| And so it was put back on the agenda for that reason because we never received the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| So you never received a fax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| And he called me after Mr. Minard gave him the notice, and he said, you know, I faxed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| And I said, well, you know, I'm very sorry, but, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| And he said, well, perhaps someone else got the fax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| And I said, well, actually, the fax machine is probably five feet from my desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| and there are only five people that normally use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| So we did not receive the fax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| Commissioner Carragher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Can I understand that you said you got a confirmation from the fax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| Do you have that sheet saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| We looked and looked and looked for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| That was several, that was three weeks prior to even the Thanksgiving break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| And just with all the paperwork, we could not find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Myself, my employee, we constantly looked for that and just couldn't come up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| I was hoping to bring that here to demonstrate actual evidence that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| we got a fax and we got information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And since the confirmation came, I assumed that I did not, and I think I poorly came to the conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| that I should have followed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| In retrospect, I definitely would have followed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| In fact, in retrospect, I would have hand-delivered the letter to the county clerk's office if I was given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=380)|
| 0:06:27| if I knew that we were going to have these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| For future, when you get a confirmation, you should always keep that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| If you had that, then we'd have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=395)|
| 0:06:36| So now, so we really don't know that there was a fax that was done for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| So apparently, she didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| So that's why I was just wanting to see if you had that confirmation that said it was sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=404)|
| 0:06:50| And you don't have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| I don't have the paper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| But the confirmation was printed, and my clerk took evidence to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| But unfortunately, it's gotten lost in the pile of paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| Is this young lady here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Is she the clerk who was with you when you sent the fax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Ma'am, have you, did you take the oath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| She did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| She did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=442)|
| 0:07:23| And will you testify today that he did send the fax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Is that what you're here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=447)|

| 0:07:34| Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| Either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Is it a 6700?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| 9002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| 9002 Oak Ridge Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| That's good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| You know, I've experienced the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| We have to do a lot of faxes where I work, and I've had instances where the fax machine has printed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=468)|
| 0:07:56| confirmation and then to get a call later saying, you know, where's your work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| It didn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| So it is rare, but it can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| But, you know, I don't know what the rest of you guys want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| I guess this is a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Did we do something kind of unusual in this as related to the fine that we waived the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=497)|
| 0:08:25| Because I know we were really impressed with his presentation that day and we felt that he was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| truly sorry for this mishap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| There was a departure from your general regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| This was very, I guess, unusual at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| But in terms of the letter, was it returned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Did it come back to your establishment as not being sufficient, not having enough zip code digits or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| No, it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| And one of the things that when we mail, we don't receive mail at the business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=542)|
| 0:09:08| And we've had issues in the past with the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| We use a post office box to receive our mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| So when there's an outgoing mail with our business address on it, we do have issues with mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| because we don't receive mail at the physical business address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| There's no mailbox present at that address and the postal service does not deliver to the business establishment itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| And that could be a reason why there was nothing returned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| But as I said, to avoid any complications with mailing again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| we came to the conclusion that it was best to fax it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| And I would not have imagined that we'd have further issues with faxing it because I thought that would be the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| immediate way to make sure that the letter would get to the appropriate person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| I'm a little torn with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| And I'll probably yield to my compadre from the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| But I think the merits still stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I mean, we kind of have the letter now and it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| But, again, I'll yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| We do have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Yes, it is late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| But in looking at it, it's very detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| I think that should this happen again, we have on file what he said he would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| And if these things aren't done, then I think we take that into consideration should we have another instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| But I'm of the opinion that we have the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| And we just wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| I would like to then make a motion to accept the letter as sufficient to meet the criteria this Board established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Commissioner Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you and Merry Christmas to you all also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=658)|

| 0:11:09| Jennifer Hatcher, Oak Lounge, 7211 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| The Commissioner recalls I was directed to send letters to the two owners that the Department encountered having on the premises illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| We have before us Attorney Charles Burks, who I believe is representing Ms. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| Mr. Burks, state your name and business address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| My name is Chuck Burks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Address is 1816 West Clinch Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| I'm a practicing attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| And this is Jennifer Hatcher, who is the owner of the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| If you don't mind, Mr. Burks, first we'll hear from the Commission because we're treading new ground here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=712)|
| 0:12:02| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| We had a report from the Police Department with regards to these illegal gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| And I believe that in our discussion last month, we were told that this is something that we probably needed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| And as I recall the discussion, we said, well, let's take a look at it and ask these folks if they would come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=735)|
| 0:12:22| And so they're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| So, Mr. Burks, I'm interested to hear what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Well, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| I'm in a little bit of a loss as to procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| I do have Chief Deputy Law Director Joe Jarrett's letter that talks about wanting to come and talk about some steps taken, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=752)|
| 0:12:43| to assure the Commission that this would not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| I have been in communication with Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| And I told him that my only reservation would be to let Mrs. Hatcher make any statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| because I have not had the opportunity to review the case in terms of whether the state would take any action in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| The county, Andy Nichols, thank you, office, to take any action in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=787)|
| 0:13:20| And if you wanted to hear from her, I'd like to at least talk to General Nichols' office first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| But in terms of trying to resolve this, this is unusual because it's not like your normal beer violation in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=806)|
| 0:13:37| having someone sell beer to a miner and then you take remedial steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| The machines that were confiscated, we are not objecting to that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=822)|
| 0:13:50| And one of the things that I would present to the court, if you all wanted to resolve this in a manner of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=830)|
| 0:13:59| there was some monies that were taken from the machines, I think it was $257.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| We would not object to forfeit that to the county as a remedial step to try to resolve this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| But I'm not sure really what, we don't plan to put anything else in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| I've talked to my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| This has not occurred with her permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| This is a situation that there's been no prior charges of anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| And so I'm not sure exactly where we go with this in terms of taking necessary steps to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=873)|
| 0:14:42| I will assure you that in talking with my client that there's no interest on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| to have machines in this establishment in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| I mean, I won't speak for the commission, but obviously the commission is looking for post-remedial measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| to preclude a recurrence is basically where we are at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Mr. Law Director, would gambling fall under one of the items that would preclude someone from having a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=907)|
| 0:15:19| Well, the way the statute reads essentially, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| is that whenever someone holding a beer permit or license under these laws are maintaining premises that are detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| to the public health, welfare, and safety and morals, there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| Now, some counties and cities in the state actually enumerate in their code gambling machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| ours is silent because this is not an issue that the board has heretofore dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| So in this instance, applying that retroactively I think would be problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| But in the future if she were to, I mean, I guess at this point she's probably not even been adjudicated, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| Has she as far as this is concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| There's not been any charges brought and that's the reason why I wanted to talk to the Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| before I would allow her to make any statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| Mr. Lee, could you answer what's the procedure here that normally happens as far as you're concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=972)|
| 0:16:21| The gambling machines are confiscated under state law that they're illegal to possess in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| The monies are turned over to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| Anything to $257 was turned over to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| It doesn't stay at the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| And the machines are, the only time anyone is charged by the Attorney General's office is if they go up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| and claim the machines, then General Nichols will prosecute them for the gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| So, and then you destroy them after a certain amount of time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| We get a court order, take them out to the dump and run a bulldozer over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1024)|
| 0:17:04| So as long as no one claims these machines, no one is going to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| So without even being prosecuted, I don't know what grounds we have to do anything here today other than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| I think it's a, you know, something that shouldn't be going on, especially at a beer establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| We have cited one person that the third time we got machines out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| that the Attorney General did tell us that we could cite them to court on gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| But this is the first time this establishment has had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| This particular owner, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Before at the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Have you ever been out at this location before, even under a different owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| No, I don't think we've done any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| You know, if there were more I could do today, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| But it doesn't sound like I can, according to what the law director said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| especially since it doesn't appear that General Nichols is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| according to his standard practice, is going to do anything about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| You know, I don't even know that we can fine him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Mr. Law Director, could we even pose a fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Sir, I think it would be subject to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I think in this instance, because your code is silent, because there has been no adjudication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| and there has been no finding by the State Attorney General that a criminal act has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| I would say in abundance of caution, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| However, I do think you may want to consider respectfully amending the code for future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| I could bring an amendment back in January for you to include specifically possession of gambling machines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| regardless of what the Attorney General does, which would give you some enforcement authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| I would like you to do that, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| I will do it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| And I hope to not see you back here again, Ms. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| You answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Mr. Houston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Yes, this is a question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| How does that apply about these people that are selling lottery tickets, were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| You know, that's gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| It's state approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| It's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I know, but I mean, I would just like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| Okay, well, if you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| When the State of Tennessee passed the lottery, they made all other gambling illegal in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1173)|
| 0:19:40| If you remember the rubber duck race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| they had to get a special legislator because that was considered gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| And so that's -- everything else is illegal except for the lottery tickets in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| unless you have a special permit from the state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Well, then apparently our legislatures down there don't think lottery is gambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| I think they've got the money coming in for the education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Thank you, Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Wolfie, on these gambling machines, when we go in, can you describe to me what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| I mean, are you following, you just walk in and, like, see gambling machines laying around all over the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| and you decide to grab them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Or how do we come about these gambling machines in our possession as a county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| We usually have compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Someone is either a mother or a wife has called and said, my husband or son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| or my daddy has spent all of his money playing the poker machines at such-and-such place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1245)|
| 0:20:52| Not only do we get them at the bars, but we also get them at the convenience stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| In the last three and a half, four years, we've probably confiscated 100 video poker machines in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| Are these just, like, sitting on the counters or, I mean, they're in plain view when you walk in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| Some are, some aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Those that aren't, do we have to get warrants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| When we're out doing beer inspections, we're allowed to walk anywhere in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| They have to let us in the offices wherever we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| We get to look in the back rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Is that by statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| It is, and it's likewise with the criminal code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| They have full and complete inspection authority for the health, welfare, and safety of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| So if they see drugs in plain sight, automatic, you know, illegal weapons, they've got pretty broad enforcement powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| In plain view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| I didn't know I had it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| Does anyone else have, do you have something else, Commissioner Armstrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| Mr. Chairman, I don't think there's anything we can do except wish these folks Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| And we hope not to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| And put them on watch that we will be changing that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| The same for the next one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1345)|

| 0:22:35| Make a motion the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Sir, did you hear the communications of the commission regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| I'm Attorney Gail Wortley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I represent B&M Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| And he's behind you at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Do you have anything you'd like to ask this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| This will be the same scenario, members of the commission, but I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Is this the same or were you the owner, sir, when the machine was confiscated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| For the same reason, I'm not going to let him answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I'll answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| There was an employee there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| These machines were in a locked storage room and the door was busted down to get the machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| I think there was one machine that had 75 cents in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| The other machines were completely had nothing in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Okay, but he was the owner at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| He was the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Officer Mays, do you want to comment on that assertion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| There was no door broke down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| Yes, so, I mean, it looks like this was not the same, so I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| Even if that door was locked, he still has access to that as the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| And if you deny him that access, he's got every right to break it down if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1425)|

| 0:23:57| I'm going to assume as far as like the last case, he's not been charged with a crime as of this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| Or is that where do we stand as far as that's concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1447)|

| 0:24:20| Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Wolfie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| When was the first time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Do you remember how long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| Has it been within the last year or has it been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| It's been longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I mean, if it's been the last couple of years or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1474)|
| 0:24:45| 10-3-0-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| So it's been about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| Sir, all I'm going to say is that, you know, once we get our ordinance changed, then as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| I'm going to come down hard on the gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Much harder than what you might want to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| So I just want to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| You've been warned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Mr. Law Director, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| Once we get this ordinance in place, I know we can't go back and penalize them for anything before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| but the fact that they have been and if he gets back again, it's going to be his third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| True, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| We can be harder on him than we can somebody on the first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| With the newly enacted ordinance, you can look back retroactively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| so you'd have to treat any subsequent offenses as the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Then I suggest we make that first fine adjustable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| I'll certainly give the commission a wide range of options within the confines of the law, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=1554)|

| 0:53:42| Our devotional this month will be led by Commissioner Bud Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| followed by the Pledge of Allegiance by Commissioner Greg Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I gave a lot of thought of what we needed to talk about tonight in terms of a devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| I could invite a preacher and I could say a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I've got a few words that actually came from my mother as a message to me that I'd like to share with you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3243)|
| 0:54:11| So the words come from 2 Chronicles 7.14, and it has to do with people and what they are called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| And in that particular Scripture, God says that if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3262)|
| 0:54:31| and pray and seek my face and turn away from their wicked ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| then will I hear them from heaven and will forgive their sins and heal their lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| And the key word there in our devotion is call by my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| It reminds me of an instance that happened a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| And in a place far away, there was a tent sitting in the middle of the field where a general was within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3297)|
| 0:55:05| and they had just finished today's battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| And the general was preparing for the next day's battle when one of his officers walks into the tent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| and he throws this lad at his feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| The general didn't even acknowledge what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| He kept working on his plans and thinking about tomorrow's encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| But he did speak when the officer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| What brings you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| And the officer said to the general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| This young man ran in the face of battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| The general kept looking at his papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Not looking at the young man at all, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| What is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| And the young man, still laying upon the ground, sat up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| My name is Alexander, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| And the general gripped the edge of his table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| His knuckles turned white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| He stood up and he reached down and he grasped the boy and he pulled him erect and he looked in his eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| And he said, What is your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| The young lad looked back down at his feet a little ashamed and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Alexander, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| And the general, the great Alexander, the great, looked at the boy and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| Young man, either change your ways or change your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| And we at this body are privileged to be called oftentimes honorable, oftentimes commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3391)|
| 0:56:40| oftentimes county commission of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| And we have the privilege of representing the people all across this county in the duty of their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3404)|
| 0:56:51| And I think we need to stop at times and remember that we are called by a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3411)|
| 0:57:00| And we represent that name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| And in our devotion tonight, let us pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for an opportunity to come together as a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=3427)|

| 1:07:45| and as public servants who care deeply about the citizens of our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| we wanted you to have a copy of this, a complimentary copy of the Salt and Light Guidebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| Just very briefly, it is sort of a massive work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| This is the third edition that we've published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| It has 440 pages, and so very briefly, I know you have a full schedule, a full agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| but I just want to give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| There are five sections to the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| In the first section, there are 28 chapters, and for every one of those 28 chapters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| we put together a focus group here from citizens of Knox County that deal with that particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| It might be homelessness. It might be those who are in the foster care adoption system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| It might be those suffering with HIV-AIDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| It might be victims of domestic violence and abuse or single moms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| And in every one of those chapters, what you have is an essay at the beginning of that chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| about the realities of what it means to live in Knox County as a single mom or as a homeless person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| And then in each one of those chapters, we have a glimpse in the life of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| We've gone out and interviewed someone in Knox County who found themselves in that particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| and we've told their story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Then we have a story of hope that really tells how when an organization, an agency, a nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4145)|
| 1:09:14| an individual comes alongside someone and walks with them and serves them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| and now they're in a different place, maybe a single mom that's in a very different place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| from where she used to be or a homeless person who now has housing and has a job and is living on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| We tell that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| But I think the most important aspect for you as commissioners is at the end of every one of those chapters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| is every possible resource that we have been able to uncover in Knox County that deals in that particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4176)|
| 1:09:47| We have contact names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| We have website addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4189)|
| 1:09:54| descriptions of what that particular agency or nonprofit does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| So when people come to you as a commissioner and they need help in a particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| we trust and believe that this will be an amazing resource for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| One of the other sections, one of the other five sections is a section on collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Compassion Coalition really believes that we should avoid duplication of services as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| So instead of recreating the wheel or starting something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| we believe that people who have a heart for service should come alongside existing organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| and agencies in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| So we have a whole section in there on the importance of collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| So we hope and trust and believe that this will be a useful tool for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4233)|
| 1:10:39| We've had 10,000 copies of these published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| We've had them about two months, and we have distributed about 2,000 copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4243)|
| 1:10:49| They don't do the county or the citizens of our county any good if they're sitting in a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| So if you know of others who would benefit from this resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| just have them go to our website at compassioncoalition.org, and they can order one off our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| I just wanted to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| That would be a great resource, because we do get hit up a lot, and this would be a good resource for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| Thank you for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Thank you for your heart of compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Mr. Mayor was down in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| He can come on back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| Your public forum time, you've got five minutes, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Remind me when I've got a minute left, and I'll be sure to wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4294)|
| 1:11:39| Well, first let me begin by saying I appreciate the interest in economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| I've made no secret of the fact one of my four priority items during the term of my administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| is to create new and better jobs for our citizens, and that just doesn't happen because you wish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4307)|
| 1:11:53| It happens because you work at it, and I think we've done a pretty good job there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| Prior to the recession hitting us, you can recall that we had created 30,000 new regional jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| and we worked closer together as a region than we ever have through our efforts with Jobs Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| and going forward to Innovation Valley because we live in a worldwide economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| and it's important that we work together as a region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| Because of our efforts over the past several years, more years than not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| we've had the state's best employment rate as a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| which also means we have the state's lowest unemployment rate as a county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| and again, I applaud those who work in economic development offices every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| During my first term in office, I made 400 business visits to firms of all sizes, both large and small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| and during my second term in office, I've made over 200 business visits, again, to both small and large companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4362)|
| 1:12:48| because both represent the backbone of our economic infrastructure and the future of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| During those visits, the purpose has been pretty simple, to encourage them, to thank them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| and to find out what we can do to assist them to grow and prosper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| We've recruited new businesses, Green Mountain Coffee, Tennessee Steel, Exedy Corporation, National Partitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| That list goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| And the reason we've been so successful in that area is because we've worked at it collectively together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4394)|
| 1:13:20| Just last week, we had a nice announcement, one that Commissioner Smith brought to me several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| and at our development corporation meeting, we sold him some additional property in the East Bridge Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| I appreciate Chairman Strickland being in attendance, Commissioner Norman, you were there that day, 200 new jobs for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| Again, a great example of how you can work together to grow your economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| I mentioned that we are in an international economy, and we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Recently, the Governor visited China, Mayor Haslam visited Japan, Mayor Cunningham in Blount County visited the United Kingdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| and as President of the County Executives of America, I went to Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| And let me tell you a little bit about Kosovo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| It is the world's newest democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| For years, it was a part of the Soviet bloc, part of Yugoslavia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| A dictator named Soledad Milosevic went into Kosovo and wreaked havoc, executing hundreds and hundreds of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4452)|
| 1:14:20| The United States came in, along with European allies, and provided relief, and now they are living there in peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4460)|
| 1:14:29| So it's gone from a socialist, communist-type country to democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| Prior to my trip, I was briefed on what I should do by the White House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| and also multiple briefings by the United States State Department, which I appreciate greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| In Kosovo, there are no golf courses, there are no luxury hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| The places I stayed didn't have air conditioning, and it was the middle of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| But I can tell you this, they have wonderful people who really appreciate Americans and what we've done for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| I couldn't have been treated nicer or more warmly during my visits there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| So you'll know I plan on going back to Kosovo and work with them in any way I can to help move them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| In terms of opportunities for American companies there, there are many, but there are also many challenges to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| Will we be moving American jobs to Kosovo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| Absolutely not, nor have we in the past, nor will we in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| But there are opportunities there for American companies to invest and engage in that economy, and I hope we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| I think democracy succeeding in Kosovo is critically, critically important, and we want to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| Again, when I was there, I visited with a large group of mayors, the United States Embassy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American University, the United States Agency for International Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| and it was a wonderful experience, which I will always value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| But again, no luxury trip, no resort, and I would encourage some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| if you ever have the opportunity to take a trip like this, to take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| And I hope I have a couple of minutes left because I want to change gears for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| and clear up a few things that have been out there that some people have said that are just totally incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| First, as it relates to our budget, some good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| We have the second largest fund balance in Knox County's over 200-year history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| We have the best bond rating in Knox County's history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and we've been able to go 10 years or longer without a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Some people say we've ran up some debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Well, we have, but let's look at what we've ran up the debt for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Hardin Valley High School, Gibbs Elementary School, Powell Middle School, the Cedar Bluff Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| $15 million in capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| We've increased spending on education annually by $90 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| We've opened Amherst and Bricky McLeod Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4607)|

| 1:18:02| Brad, you've got your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Jolie, could you patch me into the big screen, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| If the folks at CTV would like to get a shot of the big screen as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| the folks at home can see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| Let's see if this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| As I've told you several times, somebody changed your annual reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| both your state and your federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| This is on file in the local TDAC office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| Now, I know the annual reports were on file before I filed my lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| but miraculously, after I filed it, they all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| No one has turned over the original state or federal EPA report for 03, 04, or 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4725)|
| 1:18:54| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| I can prove that the EPA 503 certification statements were worded improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| and I have recovered a portion of the original reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| I'm still waiting to get a full set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| and I'm very curious why they disappeared as soon as I filed a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| that was basically based a lot of what was in those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| I wanted to cover that tonight, just to let you all be aware of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| I was going to cover over $100,000 of money that I found in addition that you all don't know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| but since Mr. Weitrich is here tonight, I decided to cover a different topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| and I'll save that $100,000 for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| As I made you all aware earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Mr. Rockett informed me that he had went to Solway and tested the material on multiple occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| and the material was contaminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| and he tells me he warned his superiors about it, that the mulch was highly contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| This particular test is on March 14th of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| The fecal coliform bacteria limit was 1,000 times higher than the legal limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| The question is, did Mr. Weitrich know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| On May 7th of 2008, this is from his deposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| As soon as we found out they were tested positive, I told Tom Salter to not only contact TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| but to contact Natural Resources and let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Pull the product out and go out and verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| This all took place in a time frame of six to seven hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I told them to contact Natural Resources, pull the products from sale, contact TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| let them know what we found, and to follow up with Natural Resources by doing a site visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| and verify that it had all been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Question, now, were any of the customers that had purchased these materials informed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| Answer, that I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| The problem is, one month later, Mr. Weitrich signed and presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| with a mediated settlement that stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| whereas Knox County has diligently investigated and reviewed the various recent third-party allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| that the products produced are somehow unsafe or present a health risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| and believes these allegations to be unfounded and without merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| Why would Mr. Weitrich present you with this after he admitted in his depositions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4868)|
| 1:21:13| he knew the mulch was contaminated and that he had been notified about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4873)|
| 1:21:19| So since he was here tonight, I thought I would throw that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| and see if he wanted to give you all an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| The other thing I was going to bring to you all's attention is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| I've told you all about county vehicles parked across from my business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| those bottom two pictures were taken out of the window of my storage building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| looking across the street in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| You can see a white Chevrolet truck with an aluminum toolbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| This truck in particular, you can see the occupant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| This isn't a real good picture, it's digitized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| but it appears he's holding a pair of binoculars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| I snuck behind the truck one day, got a picture of the tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| You can see it's GX0891.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| That truck is located, consistently parked for hours on end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| within 500 foot from my business, hiding behind the swing sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| of Ball Camp Elementary School ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| This happened all through the summer of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| and I have ran that tag, GX0891, and it's assigned to Tom Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| So maybe Mr. Weitrich can explain to me why one of his employees has been spying on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| Mr. Rocket has also went on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| and told me that he has rode along with Mr. Salter while he watched me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| Now, I made this statement and this allegation a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| and I thought I was took across like some people took me as being a paranoid nut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| but I never make an accusation if I don't have evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| What's this guy doing at an elementary school playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| oftentimes while it was closed, with no other cars there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| parked for hours on end, burning county gas on my nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4975)|
| 1:23:04| So I want to reserve the remaining two minutes I have to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| if there's any rebuttal coming from engineering on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4987)|
| 1:23:16| I suppose not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| I have one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| This is not the way to spend my tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| I know of things that are going on that are wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| I know of at least 100,000 more dollars that you all don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| It's been six months and nobody can give you a straight answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| about how much money was stolen out at halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| I have multiple sets of books for how many tons of green waste they process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| that vary 5,000 and 6,000 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| I only have one set of books that says they passed everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| and sold it all for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| but the records they filed with the EPA says that everything failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| and we went for three solid years and never sold a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| because our products were contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| I have the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| But my major question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| what's Tom Salter doing sitting across the street from my business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| I'm not exaggerating when I tell you my wife has been terrified over this crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| This is inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| But it happens and I've grown to expect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| I knew what I was stepping into when I'd done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| But the thing that I've done is I don't always tell all my cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| and you've got to be careful what I file open records requests for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| because a lot of times I've done got those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| And I just wait to see if people will lie, falsify or withhold or follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Brad, you need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Thank you, Tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5079)|

| 1:24:45| Brad, I'm going to ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| I know you're in the middle of an investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| I mean, to me, this is serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| that a person sitting there is stalking or watching whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| That's inexcusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| And, Bruce, we need to get an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| But, anyway, is there anything that we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| But I don't want to mess up your investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| I don't want the people at home thinking we're sitting here on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| The number one thing that I need help on is the original EPA reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| I can cover the state reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I don't have the original state reports in their entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| but I have the faxes that were sent by Natural Resources to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| to prepare those state reports, and they have all the relevant data on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| I do not have the original EPA reports for all of the original years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| And who has that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| There should be in file in the Solid Waste Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Now, so far, they've told me they don't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| but they also told me a lot of other things don't exist that I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| and proven that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| Also, Natural Resources should have copies under their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| I can prove, I have a letter from the EPA that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| when they inspected Natural Resources back in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| that they had absolutely all of their EPA 503 records and data on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5163)|
| 1:26:09| So if they had them in the summer of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| me filing a lawsuit shouldn't have made them disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Would it help if the law director sent a letter requesting that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Mr. Law Director, will you do that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Or do it for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Commissioner, members of the Board, is this an ongoing litigation matter, this documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| This is an open record that I'm entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| No, what I'm saying is, is this part and parcel of an open litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| It will involve the open litigation, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Okay, so do you have an attorney representing you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| I do have an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| He has sent a letter as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I've sent open records requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| They swore up and down these documents don't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| I can prove that to be untrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| And I'm entitled to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| I mean, they can't go missing if they never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| I mean, oh, these documents never existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| John never done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Well, how did they go missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| How are the EPA 503 certification statements improperly worded if they never existed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| And how come I got copies of portions of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| I've got some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| I don't have all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| I filed this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| What happened is I told Dean Farmer on December the 6th that this entire case could be proven directly from the TDAC file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| The very next day, David Draper, attorney for NRR, signed the file out and inspected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5247)|
| 1:27:32| And the next business day after that, while the case was under seal, Tom Salter, Neil Denton, Rodney Rocket, Sid Bryan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5252)|
| 1:27:40| the owner of NRR, and their attorney all met at the TDAC office while the case was under seal, and nobody's seen these documents since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5260)|
| 1:27:47| I'm not saying they got them, but I'm saying that's the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Now, those meetings don't show up in the file indexes, but they all screwed up and they dropped the ball, and this is how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| There's a security guard at TDAC, and you have to sign in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| and they all signed in with a security book at the exact same time on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| And I got pictures of the security book to prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| And in addition to that, Mr. Draper sent an email to the purchasing department and invited them in on the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| And I have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| They were invited to go all eat lunch at the Green Hills Grill the day after I told your attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| who was supposed to be representing you, that all the evidence was right in the TDAC file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| And it all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| It all vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I got a letter from TDAC saying they vanished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| I can prove they all signed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I'll pull you up a picture of the, I mean, it's in this file right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5313)|
| 1:28:42| Case summary, evidence, certification timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5322)|
| 1:28:51| Here's where they all met in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| This is where they signed in with security, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Every one of them, while the case is under seal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| And right here is where Mr. Draper, Mr. Draper requested I inform you of the luncheon meeting being held at the Green Hills Grill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5340)|
| 1:29:11| at noon on Monday, December the 10th, prior to the TDAC meeting, which begins at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5351)|
| 1:29:19| The case was under seal at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| What are they doing over their meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| And where are all the original documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Where are the original reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| I can prove they exist, and all the ones I've recovered were all changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| I'm going to ask you one more time, then, so I'm clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| You need what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| I need the original EPA biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Mr. Law Director, can you request that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| Well, you know, Commissioner, clearly I could write letters all day, but here's the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| Either the documents are in the possession of Knox County or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| Either he's entitled to them or they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| This is an ongoing litigation matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| He has an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| The remedy is, I mean, I could write letters all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| You know, if I was his attorney, I would sit there and say, I want these in discovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| You're not going to give them to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| You go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| You tell the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Now you're under the contempt powers of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| But, again, I mean, if the commission wants me to write a letter saying turn over the documents in your possession, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| If they come back and say we don't have them, I don't know what further assistance I can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| Brad, would that help you one way or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| If it won't help you, we're not going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| If the law director would be kind enough to send natural resources and solid waste, both a letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| and request the original reports, I would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| That's the one thing I fought for the hardest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| I've got a portion of these records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I need all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I can prove they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| This is a letter that I got from the EPA files that states, let's see what page it is, records and reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| All in-house data and records concerning EPA Part 503 were kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| They're telling me they didn't keep them before Tom Salter done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Well, the EPA says otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| And this letter right here was back in July of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| That's before Mr. Salter went to work for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| The original ones were improperly worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| I've seen all of them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| I know what they say, but I need copies of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| They were asked to redo them at one time because they were improperly worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| Brad, we have some more questions from other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| Well, Mr. Lauder, I would like for you to get what he is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| And it just makes me mad that people are spending taxpayers' time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| and money sitting there watching with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| And, ladies and gentlemen, this is what, two years or two years more this man has been coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| He has never been wrong on anything that I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| And he knows what he's doing with this and this stuff what he's saying about he has some of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| He has this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| Bottom line, he's trying to save us taxpayers some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| That's the bottom line, what he's trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| And I'm frustrated that it's going on this long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5529)|
| 1:32:14| and that nobody else wants to get in and put a stop to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| these department heads that have this and say, if we did wrong, we did wrong, let's move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| We keep dragging our feet on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| This is Knox County's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Mr. Jarrett, do we have somebody that's outside the council that's looking at this issue for the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| Presently, Rob McConkey in my office has, in the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| has been essentially litigating this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| Pam Reeves was looking into some issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| Oh, yes, I'm sorry, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| She's been asked as an independent investigator, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Do we have any kind of, I mean, have we had anything that we can share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| Or I don't want to, I think this isn't litigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| and all this public discussion is not beneficial as far as gathering evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| And when is this going to come to a conclusion, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| She was engaged by Mr. Lockett and communicates directly with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| I have had no conversations with her about this whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| I do know that she experienced a death in the family and that did have some delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| But, again, I guess what's troubling me is Mr. Mays has a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| and there's immediate access to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| Again, the rules of procedure are clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| If you have documentation in your possession to which the other side is entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| the court will order the disclosure of that under penalty of contempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| And, again, any letter from my office is going to have to come under Mr. Lockett's signature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| because he's the law director and you're asking essentially the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| to direct an individual who's employed by the mayor to divulge documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| that apparently he's claiming he doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Whatever the commission's will, of course, it will be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| However, again, I'm troubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| If I was Mr. Mays' attorney, I'd have been in court and demanded it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| and make the attorney for the other side say why it's not being produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5647)|
| 1:34:12| Hey, Brad, has your attorney asked for discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| We covered this in depth in Mr. Salter's depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| My question, has he covered the ask for discovery of all the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| We have asked for these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| More appropriately, have you asked the judge to issue an order for the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| We asked for production of documents when we went to the motion to dismiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| and prior to that and during depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| We actually had some documents we discovered that they had withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| After the motion to dismiss was, and Mr. Salter testified they didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| I actually pulled a sting on one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| I actually took one of these documents they swore up and down to me didn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| sent an open records request to the Solid Waste Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| and they sent me another certified letter jerking me around saying we can't help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Then I gave a copy of it to Mr. VanGilder of the Hall Shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| He's sitting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Larry called him up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| I've got this document that has totally different sets of numbers on your green waste reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| I got an email like an hour after Larry made this call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| and miraculously they found the original 2003 green waste report and sent me one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| My question, though, is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| We've asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| In discovery, have you went to the judge and said we're not getting this in discovery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| We haven't been to the court himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| I believe that's your remedy to your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| I mean, Commissioner, like Larry said, the remedy is from the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5741)|
| 1:35:47| We have no means to punish or no means to make them give you a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| Well, I didn't come here tonight for this particular subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| I changed it because Mr. Weitrich showed up this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| I came to talk about another subject, but since he was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| I wanted to cover these while he was in attendance to give him an opportunity to see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| And also, it was more than just the subjects, more than what I've brought to your attention today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| I came here with three prongs in this five minutes, which is now bleeding over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| One of the major things I was concerned with is engineering vehicles that spent a good portion of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5780)|
| 1:36:28| I mean, if that truck was over an hour, it was over there 200 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I mean, I agree that that's improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| But, again, the discovery of your evidence needs to be done through the court commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| You can't punish nor force paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| And, I mean, as much as I would like for this to be resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| because I think the discrepancies that we see need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5809)|
| 1:36:56| But I don't think this public forum is the place to resolve this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| The court needs to resolve the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Well, I see we have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| It's a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| I should be entitled to it no matter how I apply for it or ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Dwight, did you have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| Thank you, Commissioner and Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| I just want to make a suggestion to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| And as Commissioner Anders has alluded to, I think the key to this discussion is to keep it in the proper forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| So let's revisit a couple of the things that we do know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| Mr. Mays, as I've previously stated from this podium, is a litigant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5852)|
| 1:37:36| Let me remind you that he is suing you and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5856)|
| 1:37:41| Therefore, the matter is going to be heard and dispensed with at some point in time in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| If he has evidence that any member of the mayor's staff has not provided solid waste reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| and he can prove that to the contrary, and as Mr. Jarrett has said, motions for discovery have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| that would be the appropriate venue in which to provide that evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| and demonstrate that discovery was not complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| This commission has got a simple decision to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| Do you want to try this case in court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| Remember, Mr. Mays is suing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| Do you want to try it in court or do you want to try it in public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| Secondly, Commissioner Smith, I respectfully disagree with your assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| I don't know exactly how suing Knox County is supposed to save us money, but thus far it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5904)|
| 1:38:29| I also remind you we're spending money on the services of Pam Reeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| who is as good an investigator and mediator in this town as there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Why don't we give her an opportunity to do her work and file her report and let's see what the facts say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| When Ms. Reeves provides a report, you can rest assured it will be rooted in the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Just because Mr. Mays says it doesn't make it true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5927)|
| 1:38:51| He's not under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| He's simply down here under public forum offering his opinion on these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| Finally, if he has a complaint against a county employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| whether it's in the executive branch or any other branch of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| he can approach either the office holder, in our case that would be the mayor's office, come to Dr. Fogerson in HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| file his complaint, provide his evidence, and we'll act appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| This is neither the time nor the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| We can do this every month from now ad infinitum, but we won't get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| I'd like to rebut one statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Do you have anything else, Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| I'd like to rebut one statement that Mr. VandeVeet made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5970)|
| 1:39:39| The only thing I have sued Knox County for is document production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5979)|
| 1:39:43| I've never sued them for a penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5983)|
| 1:39:45| I have sued contractors who owe us money to make them pay us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| There's a distinct difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| If I'm successful in my lawsuits, you all get a wheelbarrow load of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| That's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| There's a lot more money here than you all have ever been told about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| There was $100,000 I was going to cover with you tonight I didn't get an opportunity to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| Commissioner Allman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Well, that goes to one point I wish to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| This is about money in the sense that we may be owed money, and that point should be stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| We also should stress that there's a public health concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| If material was sold that was contaminated, then there's a public health concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| I think it's perfectly within the realm of the legislative body to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| and maybe we should just keep asking questions until we get answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Granted, court suits will limit our ability to action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| But to keep the public pressure on, I hope people will continue to look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| because if there was a public health hazard and the government has lost money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| it seems to me both of those are relevant concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6050)|

| 1:41:05| I need your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And I'm here, and there will be some pictures coming up on your screens about storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| And if you'll look at this, the guy across the street from me built a nine-hole golf course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| and a driving range with no permits, no nothing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| He rearranged everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| This has been to the MPC, BZA, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| I need to bring it here, because if you'll look at these pictures as they go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| this is when it's dry down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| I live on the left-hand corner up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| If you can go on to the next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| And this is all when it's dry and it's not raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| But if you'll keep going, you'll see the rain when it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| This rain comes off of the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| And like right here, if you'll see, they raised that back level back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| You can see in the top right-hand corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| They raised it up seven feet, three and a quarter inches tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| And when they raised that up, they rushed all this water down to this drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| which drains out to the street, which comes across the street onto my piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| And when it comes onto my piece of property, it floods my garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| It floods my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| It floods the underneath of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| Now, this is only started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| We have owned this house for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| This has only started in the last 18 months to two years since the man has built the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| which was built illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| If you'll see that picture there, you can see the water that's just rushing across the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6161)|
| 1:42:47| down towards my house down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| And you'll see more pictures as she keeps going along down through of water that's standing in my yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6169)|
| 1:42:57| from this man doing this production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| And I was up here a couple weeks ago when Mr. Armstrong was talking about Ms. Cole's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| Ms. Cole does have a problem with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| But at least the person that caused this problem got permits from Knox County to do their work in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| This man got no permits from Knox County, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Ms. Cole voted for this man right here to keep his golf course as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6201)|
| 1:43:29| Now, I would like to know if my house is not as important as Ms. Cole's creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| That's what I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| My house is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I talked to Chris Gonjoo eight weeks ago, nine weeks ago exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6218)|
| 1:43:43| And he said he was going to send a crew out to take a look at this and see what could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| Well, about a week later I get a call from Chris and he says I turned it over to one of the guys that worked for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| to come out and do an evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| Well, about three days later I get a phone call from him telling me next Wednesday, which was six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6238)|
| 1:44:05| we'll be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| This is underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| This is the water that's underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| And he said I'll be out there next Wednesday to start and we're going to re-clean that ditch line out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6250)|
| 1:44:15| We're going to do all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| We're going to raise this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| We're going to do everything and stop that water from getting on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| They never showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| That was six weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| I called Mr. Gonjoo on December 2nd and December 11th and left him messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| Please call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I have water that's underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| My house is settling from this water underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| If you can see that picture right there, the water is actually underneath the pillars and the house is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| The ceilings are cracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| The door jams are dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| The doors are starting to drag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| And it's all because of an illegal operation that was across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| Now the MPC has decided, hey, he can go ahead and enlarge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| So he's going to add more parking area up on top of the hill, which is going to bring more water down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6303)|
| 1:45:12| When I went to the BZA, I appealed this to the BZA, and I went to the BZA meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| and at the BZA meeting I called Lumpy and asked Lumpy if he would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| He said he had a flight training thing that day and he couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| I asked Brad at the commission meeting the week, about a month before, if he could make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| and he said he had tried, but he didn't show either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| That's my two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| When you look at these pictures and you see the damage that's being done to my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| and nobody's doing nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| And when I went to the BZA, a Mr. York spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| And come to find out, Mr. York is real good friends with the man that owns Target Golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| And he got this passed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6353)|
| 1:45:55| He got it pushed right on through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| Okay, which they said, we're going to look at this as a brand new construction site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6359)|
| 1:46:07| The construction's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| The nine-hole golf course is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| It's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| But my house is being destroyed, and there's nothing that the commission wants to do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| My question is, is I know there's been a lot of speak about Laura Cole's property being damaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| Is it because she works for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| I mean, this is my home that's being destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| not just a stream that's getting a little extra water and mud in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| This is my home that is being destroyed by a man that did this illegally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| and Ms. Cole voted for this man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| But she has the right to come up here and complain about a little bitty creek that's being overrun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6403)|
| 1:46:51| I don't understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| and I wish that this body could help me in some way to get this guy to revert the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| or to get Knox County Engineering out there to get this water problem fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| My house is sinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Is it going to take my house falling and washing away before Knox County does something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| or is it going to take a major lawsuit to get Knox County out there to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| Is that what it takes to get this county to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| is to file a million-dollar lawsuit, a $100,000 lawsuit before something happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| Or can it not just be brought up here and say, listen, this is what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| Where is the people that are supposed to be helping the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| Stormwater is a big issue in Knox County at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| There's a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| There's a lot in West Knoxville that needs to be took up in the Cedar Bluff area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| Ms. Cole's property, my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| But these areas, these other areas that we're talking about, that you all have been talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| these contractors have got permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6472)|
| 1:47:56| They got their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| They did theirs legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| The guy that lives across the street from me did his illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| Mr. Conrad, you have a couple of people who wanted to ask you some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| I actually want to talk to Bruce, if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| Mr. Weatry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6494)|
| 1:48:22| Is this something you're dealing with, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| When I say I'm, I know of the problem, but I'm not familiar enough with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| I've not personally been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| I don't care to make an appointment to go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| We go out there the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| What I want to know is when they do the Ex-Nomura construction on the golf course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| are we going to make him then keep his water on his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| I need to go back to the very beginning of this to actually see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| to go start from start to finish to find out if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| he did not have any permits, what permits he may have obtained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| what plans he may or may not have submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| I'd like to go back and look at all that before I can tell you what's going to happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| I want to see what's going on in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| because I don't know what he's looking at as far as an expansion and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| But I want to go all the way back to the very beginning and take a complete look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Do you know if permits have been issued for construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| I mean currently for the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| I do not know whether permits have been issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| I would prefer that if you're going to, if we haven't issued permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| that if he's going to, if we're allowing him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| if his new construction needs to keep all of his water on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| I know this is a little, just from what little I do know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| it is a rather complex issue in the sense that some filling may or may not have taken place in the flood plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| and there's some things that have taken place over a period of time that we have never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| that we were not able to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| So it is kind of a little bit of a complicated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Looking at this picture here, in front of that truck there is a practice putting green, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| and that is higher and that land prior was lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| So if he's pushed that water in his new construction that's permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| we need to make sure, I'm requesting you to make sure that it keeps more water on his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| because it is a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Mr. Conrad, is that kind of a start to the beginning of the process for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| But like I said, Chris has been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| Chris Gungew was supposed to have been working on this ten weeks ago, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| and it had been passed down to the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6624)|
| 1:50:26| And then, you know, I was confident that Chris was doing something because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6626)|
| 1:50:31| well, actually at the BZA meeting, Chris told me he was going to do one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| He was going to say, no, you know, we want this man denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| And then when Chris got up there, he hauled around about it and he said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| he said, I don't know, I haven't got all my information that I need yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| Well, if you'll call and make an appointment with Mr. Weitrick and he'll come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| and maybe if my schedule allows I'll come out and we'll sit down and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| And, you know, I'm just worried about my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I mean, it's been destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| I mean, if you've seen the pictures, you've seen the water underneath, it's been destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| It's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I already know of at least $20,000 worth of damage that's been done to the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| And that's quite a bit of damage at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And if it consists, the damage is going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| If you'll call and make an appointment with Mr. Weitrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| I'll try my best to be out there with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6684)|
| 1:51:25| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| I turned my light off to keep that answer to the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6691)|
| 1:51:32| You made a reference there that Mrs. Cole worked for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| She had voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| Who does she work for and how did her vote get involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| She's with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| She voted for him at the MPC for this to pass through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| and for him to get permission to do his expansion of the rest of it, which he's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| And so all he was doing was begging for forgiveness at the BCA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| And that was, if you'll look at the BCA meeting records, that's what he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| And even they said at the BCA, you're begging for forgiveness on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| And he said, yes, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| But he had already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| He said that he didn't know because he was doing the work himself that he needed permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| Well, he knows better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| In 1999, the man was cited for not having permits for filling in the wetlands in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6736)|
| 1:52:22| He was cited again in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| So the man knew what he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Now, he's not an idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| He's very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| And so he knew what he was doing at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| So what he did was he was trying to sneak this in because he knew he wouldn't get the proper permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6754)|
| 1:52:41| Stormwater wouldn't have given him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| TDEC would not have given him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| The Department of Tennessee would not give him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| And the EPA would not give him the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| He knew this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| But now that he's already done the work and he's filled it all in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| we have the pictures of him doing the fill-in, hauling all the dirt and stuff in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| Now that he's done all this work and everything, they don't want to take that away from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| They don't want to make him dig all of it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Sir, going back to Mrs. Cole there, is she an employee of Knox County or is she a volunteer on MPC, an appointee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6790)|
| 1:53:17| I think she's an appointee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| She's not actually an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Well, the only thing I can say is it looks to me like you've got a larger problem than Mrs. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| I will have to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6813)|
| 1:53:35| Bruce, I have a question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6815)|
| 1:53:46| Now, I know you haven't looked into this and so there's no specific information that you can really give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| but here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| We have a fairly strong stormwater ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| I think we have a great stormwater ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Is he going to have to comply with current stormwater standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| Because it's pretty obvious from these pictures that he probably doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Or is there any kind of grandfather process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Is he going to be able to slip through by saying, back when this was built, this was compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| I mean, and here's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| I mean, I understand it's easier to ask forgiveness than to ask for permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| but what I'm saying is that there probably needs to be a consequence of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| of that when he is caught, he has to comply with current standards rather than saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| well, this was fine three years ago when we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| And so that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| When you all start looking into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| are you going to make him comply with current standards or backdated standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| Currently for any new construction, it's got to use current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Anything that transpired prior to the new ordinance being adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| you would not be able to require them to use the new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| But what's key here is really going back and looking at what approvals either BZA had given them or what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6900)|
| 1:55:06| because they can override our stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| and essentially if he went in and did a bunch of work without permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| and they went ahead and grandfathered them in, that may have trumped my stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| That's why when Commissioner Anders was asking me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| is I really want to go to the very beginning of when all this started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| and find out exactly what transpired, what permits were issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| what approvals were given by various agencies so I know where we stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| and I can give you a more definitive answer to your question after I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| And I mean, you know, I mean, I know that he's been cut a lot of slack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| and a lot of people really appreciate that, and he's a nice guy, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| A lot of people really appreciate that he hasn't built yet another, you know, subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| or condominium complex that, you know, a golf course does keep it somewhat green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| but, you know, and I understand we need to cut somebody like that a little slack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| because they are preserving some green space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| but not to the point where it floods his neighbor's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| And I don't want to leave the impression that we have cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| that Engineering and Public Works has cut him any slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| No, no, I mean, I'm talking about the legislative body zoning BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| and I understand why they have over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| and can appreciate that to a certain degree, but not at this gentleman's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6978)|
| 1:56:28| I got one thing to say to that, Lombie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| When he was given permission by the MPC, the MPC, and I've got it in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6991)|
| 1:56:37| stated that this, at that date, would all be as of new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=6997)|
| 1:56:45| So he had to apply from that date to get the permits from the state, the EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7005)|
| 1:56:53| Stormwater, and everybody else knew permits for that to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| They had to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| So the work that he's already done has to be reevaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| That's my understanding from the MPC, that it was going to be looked at as a new project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7030)|
| 1:57:11| Well, that makes it a lot better because, I'll tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| this body passed a very strong stormwater ordinance a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| that I think if he has to comply with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| he's going to have to take care of his water better than he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| But keep in mind, you probably want to consult with a private attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| because if you've been damaged because of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| there's a lot more than just what Knox County can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| You may have been damaged in a way that, through litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7055)|
| 1:57:40| you can seek compensation for those damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| So you may want to consult with a private attorney as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7066)|
| 1:57:48| We have one more question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| Commissioner Broves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| I was just going to ask Bruce to come back next month and give us an update on this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7072)|
| 1:57:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7079)|

| 2:01:00| I think we've already passed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7260)|

| 2:01:20| He has dedicated his life to protecting all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7280)|
| 2:01:26| The two most important things that we do in this community, one being education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| and the next is law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| Because without law enforcement and without the following of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7293)|
| 2:01:37| then all we have is chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| And we wouldn't be able to enjoy all the freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| and all the privileges that we have by living not only in this great country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| but this great community here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| And I want to thank Tom Spangler for all that he has done for all of us here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7309)|
| 2:01:55| And I thought I'd have if the mayor and if the sheriff would like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| I would just add to that that Spanky and I have been together since 1980,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| so I'm surely going to miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| I would only add that he has spent more than half his life serving Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7328)|
| 2:02:13| and we're all much better for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7333)|

| 2:06:43| He does that after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7603)|

| 2:06:51| what those representatives of those neighborhoods should go back and tell their neighbors what to be concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7611)|
| 2:06:59| whether there's vandalism going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7619)|

| 2:07:12| And I just would like to extend my gratitude for all the many years of dedication to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7632)|

| 2:07:29| Basically, the same thing about Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7649)|

| 2:07:37| And, again, we are all better for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| I have one little added bit of information about Ben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7660)|

| 2:07:59| Don't call me, call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7679)|

| 2:08:06| I've known that for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7686)|

| 2:08:21| Ben's been an exemplary law enforcement officer a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| But more than that, here's what I really appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7705)|

| 2:08:40| And there are lots of other things he could be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| But he has given so much of his time to civic and charitable endeavors, as well as to make our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=7722)|

| 2:14:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| If we set the numbers on this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8055)|
| 2:14:18| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| I think Commissioner Briggs would like to be recognized first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| I will refer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8061)|

| 2:14:25| I need a second to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8067)|
| 2:14:28| May I make a request first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| What I would like to do, because this is so important, I won't go over all of this again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| because we've been through it both at the Finance and the Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| is to split this up because I think that we all agree that something needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| because we need to repair some of the deficiencies in 8-05 so we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| And I've discussed this just a little bit with the Chairman on the proper way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| I would like to split it so maybe we can approve all except for Paragraph C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8092)|
| 2:15:01| which deals with the number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| So maybe we could vote first to approve the rest of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| and then we can debate and decide on the number of signatures if that seems to be the wisdom of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8106)|
| 2:15:13| Is that allowable or proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| And if that's the case, what I would like to do is to make a motion that we approve all but Paragraph C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8116)|
| 2:15:22| which deals with the number of signatures that's required on a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8122)|
| 2:15:29| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Let me make clear a parliamentary inquiry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| So what you're doing is, in effect, making a motion to split the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| that we would consider all but that one portion, and then we would return and consider that portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| And then, I don't know, since we're going to require a two-thirds vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8144)|
| 2:15:48| if what we need to do, just so we can get back to one, but let's all agree that we need to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8148)|
| 2:15:57| because if we vote on something and it's voted down, then the whole thing is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| And I don't think any of us want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8160)|
| 2:16:02| We just want to be able to decide then separately on the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8162)|
| 2:16:08| Is everyone clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8168)|
| 2:16:10| Before we vote, I want Erin Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8170)|
| 2:16:18| I want to speak on, I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8178)|
| 2:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| My name is Erin Lowness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8185)|

| 2:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| As I understand the recall amendment, it simply affords voters an opportunity to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8194)|
| 2:16:38| or remove an elected official when a specific reason is spelled out on the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8198)|
| 2:16:43| I ask you to think about why this amendment was crafted in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8203)|
| 2:16:48| In September of 2008, Mr. Bill Phillips ran unopposed for school board in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8208)|
| 2:16:54| He received 3,800 votes and took his seat on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| Last December 26th, Mrs. Karen Phillips called for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| She reported that her husband had threatened her with a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| Seven Knox County police officers responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| Mr. Phillips reported to the officers that he had taken 30 Ambien and was taken to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8228)|
| 2:17:15| Some three weeks later, Mrs. Phillips recanted her statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| thus facilitating a plea to a lesser charge of misdemeanor assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8239)|
| 2:17:24| He was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8244)|
| 2:17:29| Had Mr. Phillips received a sentence of just 24 hours more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| we would have had the option to file an ouster suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8253)|
| 2:17:38| The school board subsequently censored Mr. Phillips and requested his resignation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8258)|
| 2:17:44| Thus far, he has refused, and it is my position that this is exactly the kind of situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8264)|
| 2:17:50| that the recall amendment was created for in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| There must be a reason, and the citizens need to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| Last summer, 30 to 40 citizens formed a group for the purpose of recalling Mr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| We created an informational website, an email address, secured a post office box, and a bank safety box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8285)|
| 2:18:14| In September, the language in our petition was approved by the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| We understood that we had 90 days to collect signatures from 15% of the registered voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| Although there were only 3,800 votes cast in that race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8305)|
| 2:18:29| we were required to gather 4,000 ballot signatures just to put the question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8309)|
| 2:18:35| That deadline has nearly come to pass, and I would like to offer my insight as to why we are going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8315)|
| 2:18:42| To begin, the list of registered voters does not accurately represent the actual registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8322)|

| 2:18:55| My district is greatly rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| We have some subdivisions and some older ones that are partially composed of rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| I, however, live on a farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| My home sits 900 feet off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8345)|
| 2:19:08| If you attempt to come to my door, after crossing the wooden bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8348)|
| 2:19:13| you would find a cattle pedal fence and an electric gate some 600 feet from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| My situation is not unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| Approaching a door in a rural setting can be a dangerous proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| In my experience, on a good full day of knocking, we were lucky to garner 40 valid signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| My district is the largest landmass, and yet it lacks the typical community gathering spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| We don't have parades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| There is no duck pond and definitely not a town square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| We did, however, gather signatures at the Community Recreation League games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| Our greatest success was on days when there was an away UT football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8388)|
| 2:19:53| On Saturdays, most people were not home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| During the remaining weekdays, catching voters home before dark, yet after work, proved fruitless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8396)|
| 2:20:03| In 90 days, there are only 12 Saturdays, and we needed 4,000 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| I can report that those voters we were able to contact were happy to sign the petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| We only encountered six individuals unwilling to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| Although political activities have been allowed on school property in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| Knox County has decided that now and in the future, there will be absolutely no political activity on school grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8422)|
| 2:20:30| With all the resources that the Election Commission has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8430)|
| 2:20:34| it seems unfair to expect a citizen's group to gather in excess of 100% of the votes cast in a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| Had we been successful, the need for a vote would be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| Basing any number of signatures gathered on registered voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| is basing it on a misrepresentation of the actual registered voters living in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| I actually wonder if the entire process of signatures and petitions is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8456)|
| 2:21:02| And finally, as an elected official, you are held to a certain standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| It is a reflection on you when your fellow officers behave badly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| My recommendation for the number of signatures is to be 25% of those that voted in the race of the official in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8472)|
| 2:21:19| To gather that many would still be a huge challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8479)|
| 2:21:22| It only takes 25 signatures to nominate a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| Where is the logic setting the bar so high that the recall option is unattainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8486)|
| 2:21:32| And let's not forget that after jumping through all the hoops, the goal is simply to put the question on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| A ballot that gives the voters a deserved chance to choose for or against that official, a chance to right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| I would also request that the 90 day time limit for gathering the signatures be dramatically increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8505)|
| 2:21:51| There is a one year in office waiting period before a recall can be initiated, so why 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8511)|
| 2:21:58| How does the time limit serve the voters? Why not six months or a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8518)|
| 2:22:04| I submit the current recall option does not serve the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8524)|
| 2:22:12| In its current form, the recall amendment serves no purpose for misuse if it isn't attainable for legitimate reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8532)|
| 2:22:21| I would also suggest that not only it should contain consequence for impeding the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| but should offer a remedy when impeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| I don't have any questions. I'll answer a couple of those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8567)|
| 2:22:52| Now, right now, the issue that's before us is to approve everything but the signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8572)|
| 2:22:57| Probably a year is not impossible, because the petition has to be turned in and approved by the Election Commission 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8577)|
| 2:23:04| before the next general election, which if you wait a year before you can start it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8584)|
| 2:23:09| then that would push you past the next election date by a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| So really, about nine months, even if you hit it exactly right, would be the longest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| We do, according to state law, have the option of making that date anything that we wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| And so if we wanted to, we could extend the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| I picked the 90 days because that was already there, but that is a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8609)|
| 2:23:34| We can make it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8614)|
| 2:23:39| Probably the maximum amount that you would want to make it is eight months, if we wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| And even then, that might run your deadline past the deadline for turning the petition in for the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| The other point that I wanted to bring up was to have penalties for anyone that tries to impede the process of collecting these signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8629)|
| 2:23:56| That is prevented in the present recall amendment that we have, and it's going to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| and it is addressed in the one that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| There are laws and there are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| There's no remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| And state law does have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| There actually is. It's under Section...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| Let's see here. It's under Paragraph H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| I'm sorry, Paragraph I, if anyone's looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| Number four, about who to report to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| And in three, it's any manner to practice intimidation upon or against any person in order to induce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8682)|
| 2:24:47| or compel such persons to sign or refrain from signing a petition for recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| And then it goes ahead and says what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| If that impedes us, if we have such a short period of time and that impedes us any portion of that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| and we miss the number we need, I mean, there has to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| Well, I mean, the remedy would be to put your...is to refile your petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| And then start the 90 days over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8717)|
| 2:25:22| Of course, you'd have to go back and get your same number of signatures that you would have to do that over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8727)|
| 2:25:32| I agree with much of what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8732)|
| 2:25:37| But there's things we can do and things that we can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8737)|
| 2:25:42| The two things that we can do, we can change the length of time that the petition can be circulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| and we can determine the number of signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| We don't want to encourage it to be impeded. See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8752)|
| 2:25:57| Those are the two things that we can decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| I believe, I don't know if anyone wants to make any comments on that, but anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| I think that the motion on the floor right now is to approve this up to the signatures unless someone wants to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| the amount of time that the petition can circulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8772)|
| 2:26:17| I think it would be up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| Incidentally, this is 15 days longer than our 85, yeah, it's 15 days longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| The state, to recall state offices under the state constitution and out of charter counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| they have a 75 day circulation period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| And so we are making it longer than the state at 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8804)|
| 2:26:50| And here's the reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8810)|
| 2:26:55| That would give people a year plus nine months to sign a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| And we make a lot of votes up here regardless of what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| It makes people mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8825)|
| 2:27:10| We vote on zoning issues and people would, you know, sign that petition just because they're mad at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8830)|
| 2:27:15| We don't vote to put people out of office because of some of the tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8835)|
| 2:27:21| We vote for tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| You understand, there would be things like that, but I'll go along with the 90 days, but nine months I can't go along with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| I just think it's a good point that when you're trying to do this in one of the rural districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8856)|
| 2:27:41| 90 days is a tough deadline to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8861)|
| 2:27:46| We might want to, I mean, I'm sorry, 90 days is a tough deadline to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| So we might want to look at extending it maybe not nine months, but maybe, you know, six months or five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-091214-part-one?start=8871)|
