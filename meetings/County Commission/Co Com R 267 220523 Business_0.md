| 0:35:12| and we determined that we wanted to continue to preserve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| so we're now under the process of taking steps for putting it in a better ownership structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| and conservation easements in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2121)|

| 0:47:18| This means people will be on the road for vacation, even with $5 a gallon fuel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| and they'll be on the lake for some fun in the sun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| We've got to urge our folks, all of them, anybody that can hear us, to be careful and smart when they're out on the roadways and they're out having fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2847)|
| 0:47:37| Our new ladder truck will be in town by the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Look forward to that coming up soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| To say that we are excited to get it here is an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| My wife says we think of fire trucks like most people think of new babies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| So we're excited for their arrival, but then know that when they get here, we'll have to put a lot of work into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| Well, in our case, we'll put a lot of work using them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| Always know that we're here for you if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Please don't hesitate to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2888)|
| 0:48:14| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Bagwell, for your, as always, thorough yet concise report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| This brings us to the first segment of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| We do have four individuals who have requested to speak on a particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| And these individuals will be given up to five minutes each to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| The first speaker is Ms. Diane Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| And Ms. Montgomery, if you'd like to go ahead and approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| And if you'll just state your name and county of residence, you do have five minutes to address county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| Diane Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| I live in West Knoxville at 2106 Treywood Lane off Tulespin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| I'm here on behalf of a large community organization called the North Shore Corridor Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2937)|
| 0:49:06| And I wanted to share with you the experience of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| I am also the former immediate past president of the Amberley Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| and I'm one of the founding members of the Knox County Planning Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| The way that all of that has come about for me was that a developer proposed a very, very large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2964)|
| 0:49:32| it would have been the largest single family residential development in Knox County at the time, about five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| down off Tulespin Road, which is a pioneer trail that was paved some years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| and really never improved much since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| So when that happened, the neighbors began to organize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and really have spent the last five years organizing and staying organized because of what happened to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| I'm speaking to ask you to reconsider Commissioner Smith's proposal to weaken or eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3006)|
| 0:50:15| I don't think I fully understand the proposal about BZA, but I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:25| Sending Knox County citizens directly to court is a very poor option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| It's extremely expensive, and it's extremely time-consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| As I mentioned, we formed about five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| We're still at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| We have spent so many thousands of dollars that I'm embarrassed to tell you the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| We were extremely fortunate in that among our group of volunteers who formed, we kind of had it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3050)|
| 0:51:01| I personally am a retired professional fundraiser, so that was a pretty good skill to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| We had managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| We have engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| We have lawyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| We have home builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| We have large general contractors, a lot of homeowners, and lots and lots of individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| We were lucky enough to have a few individuals who had substantial wealth and stepped up early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| and gave us the confidence then to go and raise money because they were willing to put up the first funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| That, I think, brought our lawyers to the table because I'm not sure that the lawyers we were able to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| at that level of quality would have done so without that kind of guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3104)|
| 0:51:52| It was hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| For some of us, the core leadership team, it became the equivalent of a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| Some of you know me pretty well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I think some of us are now friends because I have been down here so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Our experience probably could have been avoided early on if we and the processes down here had been clearer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3130)|
| 0:52:22| if the understandings were clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| It should all have been resolved at BCA, but there are some things there that need to be strengthened and smoothed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| and I would urge you to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I think you might be already planning to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| But because it wasn't smooth, things did not go smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3160)|
| 0:52:47| We had expert witnesses who prepared documents for us, and our lawyers submitted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| They didn't progress through the system as they should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and so we didn't know that and BCA didn't know that at the time that those were critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| so it did progress on to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Taking that option of BCA off the table for ordinary citizens and ordinary citizen groups I think is just an injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3189)|
| 0:53:21| We had it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| We are lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| We happen to be on the west side where people are a little more affluent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Help and help the rest of the neighborhoods around the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| and the individuals around the county who can't marshal those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| That should not be taken away from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| So happy to answer your questions if you have some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3220)|
| 0:53:51| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I was wondering how long was the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Today is five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| The court ruled just several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| It progressed from circuit court here to court of appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3241)|
| 0:54:07| and then the developer and property owners tried to take it all the way to the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3247)|
| 0:54:17| and the Supreme Court upheld what the court of appeals had done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| and all of that happened really because of just a mistake at BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| Robert Thompson was the chair of BCA at that time, and the evening that we were heard, he urged the group to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3269)|
| 0:54:37| Don't take a vote that evening because he saw that they didn't have enough information to make a good decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:44| but other members of that entity pressed really hard that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| and a vote was taken, and it was that that the court said was an arbitrary and capricious decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3289)|
| 0:54:58| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Commissioner Smith, I'm going to allow one more question, and then we're going to proceed on with public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Hi, Ms. Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| How long did the process while you were at BCA take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| Are you speaking of just the hearing itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| When you filed your appeal, yes, until you were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| You know, it's a long time ago now, and I don't remember that clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| I don't remember, you know, maybe weeks or months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| But it ultimately took going to court to correct what the BCA did for you all to get your justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3333)|
| 0:55:42| Yeah, and as I said, we were very fortunate to be able to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| I think that most groups would not be able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| and I urge you, especially you, Mr. Smith, to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| I think that's an injustice to the citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you, Ms. Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Our next speaker is Sandra Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3366)|
| 0:56:16| Welcome, Ms. Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| My name is Sandra Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| I live at 5212 Daphne Drive, and Commissioner Beeler is my new commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Hello, Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| I'm three days late, and I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you for this opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I understand you've got a big, long agenda, and I'll keep my marks very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| I speak as a trained and experienced urban planner, credentialed with AICP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| a former planning commissioner to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| and a board member of KCPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| I'm here to speak about the resolution introduced concerning the appeal process for uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3420)|
| 0:57:08| I looked over the work session video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| and I understand that there were a number of topics that came up that should be more directly addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| through the planning commission on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| I think that if the resolution directing planning commission for a recommendation and review was more specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| that would save time for the commission here once it returns to you for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| I've identified five topics, and I'll run through them very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| One is, first, this is a process that would affect all of the uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| Are there unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| It's more than just planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Two, what are the actual costs and time typical of a appeal to BCA as compared to the chancery court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:15| Three, should this resolution, the BCA appeal process, be considered in isolation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| Are a part of the advanced Knox program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| which is looking at a comprehensive land-use transportation and our land-use processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| Four, what are the problems with the existing planned residential regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| Really, all of this is coming about because of the way that that regulation was drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| It's very ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| You can't figure out exactly what is to be required of the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| hence the number of appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| a quasi-judicial body that has the freedom and flexibility to actually negotiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3537)|
| 0:59:04| and come to a solution agreeable to both the developer and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| Chancery court is much more restricted and difficult to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3549)|
| 0:59:17| We know that the study for revising planned residential was undertaken in 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3557)|
| 0:59:25| because the Planning Commission itself identified several problems that needed to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| That was stopped with advanced Knox, hence no more progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| and hence the dilemma that we're facing with the concern about housing units in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| Finally, and this is a little bit of an aside, but I've got your attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| the staff recommendation, the analysis and the staff recommendation comes out six days before the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:59| I've heard developers as well as the public complain about that time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| and can we ask the Planning Commission staff if they can allow that more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| So in summary, because I'm running out of time, one, are there unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Two, what are the actual costs and time for the BZA appeal versus Chancery Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| Three, should this proposal be considered in isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| or should it be sent to evaluate through the advanced Knox program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| Four, what are the problems with the existing PR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| I mean, that's the kernel, isn't it, is that PR isn't working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| And then five, can the staff report be delivered sooner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| KCPA believes that the topic of use on review appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| should be considered as part of the advanced Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Removing the BZA from the appeals process denies the public an affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| and more friendly public participation in reviewing an important decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| The appeal process actually just takes a few weeks or months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| Chancery Court, poof, who knows how long that's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| It depends on so many other variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| And then finally, the quicker the issue is resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| it's a hang-up for the developer, the applicant, and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| You're in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Let's find the fastest process, the easiest process, and stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| Look at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Just a note in your packet in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| I think it was handed out later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| These five questions should be in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| and please do look at them in your resolution to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you, Ms. Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Keith Britt is our next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| I don't mean to be flippant whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| but I have no doubt that after tonight national-based developers will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| celebrating the new laws that are recommended tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| I have no doubt that there will be an erosion, as Commissioner Hill put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3741)|
| 1:02:31| of our agricultural heritage and, as Commissioner Buehler put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| of the love of our land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| I have no doubt that our community's natural resources are going to diminish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| and our community's infrastructure is going to be overwhelmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| and this very well may destroy our community's identities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| We recognize the need for more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| and we welcome those prospective new neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| but removing the oversight of community leaders in favor of a complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| and expensive legal maze is taking 10 steps backwards to take one step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| Furthermore, this is a naked attempt to confound what is legal and what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| moral, and Jesus warned us about that sin over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| So, please, for the sake of this county, for the sake of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| for the sake of my kids, who I want to grow up in this county, reject this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| Leave the power with the people trying to preserve their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| and not with the developers trying to maximize their profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| At the very least, you have Commissioner Smith here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| You have Mayor Jacobs here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| At least help us ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| Help us understand how this resolution came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| Help us understand why this is a good deal for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| because it sure seems like a bad deal for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| Thank you, and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Thank you, Mr. Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| We have Lisa Starbuck, who has requested to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| and Ms. Starbuck, I'm going to go ahead and let you talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| because your item is just one item away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| So, you'll state your name and county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Lisa Starbuck, 6229 Baberly Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| I'm going to be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| I'm speaking regarding the acceptance of new roads into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| That's an item that happens every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| and this month we have, oh, it looks like about 14 roads or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| that we're taking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| It's kind of buried down in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| If you go through the agenda and actually click on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| you can see how much each road is anticipated to cost taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| but we made a spreadsheet that showed all of the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| that are going to be accepted this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and it looks like around $327,000 is how much it will cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| to resurface these roads in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| I know that roads and new subdivisions are something that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| and have to live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| However, I think that it's something that commissioners should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| when we are accepting new subdivisions and new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| to realize that this comes with a cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| and it's a very measurable and real cost when we are, correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| someone if I'm wrong, I believe about $40 million behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| on our road budget currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| and yet we are continuing every month to add more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| roads to our requirements for resurfacing in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| without taking a serious look at our road budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| So I just wanted to bring that to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| I'm sure you're all very well aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| but I think that it's something that we need to make people more aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| and that it should be a factor of consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| when you are thinking about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you, Ms. Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4009)|

| 1:11:03| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| Item 55 is consideration of the closure of a portion of O'Taswell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4264)|

| 1:11:14| This is on First Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Chair will make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I have a motion by Commissioner Beeler with a second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| I just want to, before we vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| I just want to highlight that we had a few constituents who emailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| and talked about the dangers of closing that road down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| and I don't know if Mr. Snowden can kind of explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| People, I guess, and I understand when you grow up in a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| you're just used to taking that road, but would this cause any risk factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| any increased wrecks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| It looks like they said that it's hard to turn left on O'Taswell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| because of the traffic, and I can understand if you're elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| and it's already nerve-wracking to deal with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| but just kind of wondering how we thought about that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| Mr. Snowden, you have the podium, and I have a couple remarks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| Yeah, I received those emails, looked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| That is something we considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Obviously, you know, there's both ends of that roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| where it ties into Murphy Road is very close to O'Taswell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| and the signal and the queuing of traffic is problematic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| And then the intersection where it ties into Luttrell and O'Taswell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| is probably one of the most unusual intersections you'll ever see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| It's like five points, literally, with no throat separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| And the O'Taswell Park itself in that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| the other section north of there is actually a much better street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| It's probably 18 to 20 feet wide, centerline and edge pavement markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| The section that we're proposing to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| and one of the main reasons why we were proposing that, is its width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| At the nearest intersection on the north end near Luttrell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| it's very narrow, probably 13 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| You can't pass another car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| We've, over the course of time, received complaints about that cut-through traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| If you go out there today, there's speed humps on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| to kind of control and mitigate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| So as this development came in, we wanted to try to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| to solve a couple of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| I admit there is some inconvenience associated with this closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| but I still stand behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| I think it is the best thing from a traffic safety perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| Granted, there are inconveniences, but I do think this—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I think if the state were to ever redo Tazewell Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| they would greatly modify that intersection of Luttrell and O'Taswell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| And probably close some of those legs anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| So I'm certainly conscious of those folks' concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| but I do think for the overall public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| this proposal is the best thing from a traffic engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| Thank you, Mr. Stodden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Director Stodden, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| are you saying that the state is going to widen Tazewell Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| No, that was just—if and when they do widen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| there would be significant challenges with the alignment of those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| So it would be something that—my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I may have misled you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| I lived on Ridgeview Road for most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| and I've cut through old Tazewell Park many, many, many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Used to do it almost every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Would not do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| And my parents still live on Ridgeview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| and it is hard to turn left onto Tazewell Park from Ridgeview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| But they do it, and I do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| and it's better than taking old Tazewell Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| because it is very narrow and just simply not a good pass-through road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| And I did speak with a couple of the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| And there is another month if the public wants to weigh in further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4500)|

| 1:17:31| This is the General Government Resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| requesting the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| to recommend amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| to provide for use on reviews, appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| to a court-competent jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| Mr. Smith, I wanted to give an opportunity to go over this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| When Mr. Britt spoke during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| he said something about approving new laws tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| and I want to make sure it is clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| that there's nothing being changed in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| If I understand this correctly, and please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| this is a recommendation to send it to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| and ultimately Planning staff at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| to examine the idea and look at zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| and looking at the appeals and the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| and essentially vet it out in a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| and then come back to us with more in-depth research analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| recommendations, and other information for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| This is not changing anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Is that an accurate statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| Yes, Commissioner Jay, that's an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| This is just to send it back to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| where the experts in planning, along with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| can look at this and see what next steps we need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4754)|
| 1:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| When I looked at this, we talked about it last week briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| I looked at it again and talked about it this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| Actually, what's interesting is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| much like many things in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| once you start pulling on different threads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| different things come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| I've heard five or six different that this may be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| that may be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| this may be a totally different jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| county commission may play a different role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| BEZA did a different role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| Obviously, it's confusing as it is now in a normal sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| much less thinking about how things might change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| I'm ultimately in favor of this resolution for the simple fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| that it sends it back to really be vetted in an appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| I mean, we can certainly do it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| but we have a planning commission, we have a planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| that we task with sort of digging into the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| It may be part of something that should be part of advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| It may be something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Ultimately, I would rather them vet it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| and really come back to us with much more detail than to us do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| And I want to make sure the public knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| that we're not actually changing anything in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| This is simply asking them to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| I'm interested to see what they come back with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| I'm interested to hear the discussion and to better understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| is this the process that we should take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| Is there a completely different process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Is there something that we're missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I think the citizen's voice is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| I also think the courts are the subject matter expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| ultimately, when it comes down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| And so I have information from Mr. Murphy that he's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| I have information from our planning commission they've provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| I feel more comfortable that they kind of kick the tires on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| in a detailed way and then send it back to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| and then we can sort of better understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| So thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| Thank you, Commissioner Jaye. Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I'm just piggybacking off of Commissioner Jaye. I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| I want to thank the public for coming out and sending us emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| and calling us and texting us about your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| You were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| I'm supporting it, too, just for planning commission to go vet it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| because they are the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| And please continue to use your voice. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| Today I received a memorandum from Director Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| and I was just wondering if he could take a little bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| and kind of give us like a brief summary of kind of what that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| and the differences that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Well, of course, the request came to draft a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| that would explore the BZA's authority to hear uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| And during the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| it became apparent that what was really being sort of the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| was development of subdivisions and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| So the thing about our zoning code is it's kind of evolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| over a very long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I don't know when the last time was anybody sat down and wrote it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| from start to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| It was probably in the 1990s or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| But in reading the regulations closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| what you find is over the years there's been a conflation of two terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| that are important in the concept of zoning, particularly in this context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| One of them is use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| It's what everybody thinks of when an MPC looks at something in subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| or in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| But there's also the concept of development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| And, for example, when you read the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| which seems to be the zone that a lot of these issues arise in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| the administration section says that the MPC will look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| and approve or change or modify the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| It does not mention uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| And, in fact, within the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| there are uses that are permitted by right and uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| And those are different than development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| And when you look at the powers of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| the Board of Zoning Appeals specifically has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| to look at uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| It is pointedly not given the authority to look at development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| And so I believe that when you read the code closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| there's a real question about whether or not the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| has the authority to review development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| which would include subdivisions in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Now, this could be a problem with drafting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| If we want the BZA to have that authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| we may need to specify that clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| I think Director Brooks and I have had several conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and she understands and agrees that there's some slack in the terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5043)|
| 1:24:10| So this is just something that I wanted to put out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5050)|
| 1:24:16| that the resolution that we're on right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| and the ordinance that has been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| would remove all use on review authority from the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| It may be that if what we want to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| is to have subdivision plans be reviewed directly to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| that's my understanding of what was being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| it may be that nothing needs to be done to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| Or if we want the BZA to have that review authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| we may need to amend the code to make sure that it's specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| But I think as the code is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| I have some real questions about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5100)|
| 1:25:05| the BZA has the authority to look over those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| Uses on review are generally specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| They're laid out in Article 4, Section 2 of the Zoning Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| and they include things like demolition landfills, auto wrecking yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| and a number of other uses that are listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| They're not, generally speaking, subdivisions within that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| So there's some things in the code that need to be tightened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| There's some policy decisions that need to be made by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| by the county mayor, by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| I was just pointing out in that memo that I think that BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| is assumed to have power that I'm not sure that it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| when you read the Zoning Code the way it's written today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| I'm sure that's probably confused everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| but I do much better with paper than I do with the spoken word, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| Thank you, Mr. Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Commissioner Durett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Would planning staff actually get to offer their opinions on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| or would it just go to Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| Oh, it would go to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| Under the Zoning Code and under the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| any amendment to the Zoning Code, which this ordinance would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| has to be reviewed by MPC and recommendations made first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| So we send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Staff will probably consult with the commission itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| The commission, I think, will vote out recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| which then this body can act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Okay, and could this actually potentially be a part of advance NOC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| since that is a whole revamping of our land use policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| and something that we're spending so long to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| and to make sure we're getting things right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| You are the legislative body for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| and this zoning ordinance is your product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| and you can amend it, you can word it any way you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| now or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| That is your prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Thank you, Commissioner Durett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5232)|
| 1:27:21| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I'm well, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| Last week you and I had a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| about how many uses on review filings had been to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| and you had it for the last four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| You've seen the document that was prepared, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| from Mr. Murphy where he went back 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| Is the number on that chart accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Yeah, we compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| I had my code staff put together every case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| that had went to BZA since 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| and we shared that information with Mr. Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| so I believe that information is now consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| So is that 13 appeals in the last 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| 13, I'm sorry, expand a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| 13 appeals to BZA in the last 15 years, use on review appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| Is that the right number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| There's a few more than that, and I'm going off memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| I think there were 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Okay, 19 in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Yeah, I think there were some that were withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| before they were heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| But yeah, my number's correct, is 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| I mean, when you have that few in that many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| I don't understand what the problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| and what the race to get this done is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| You know, like one of the speakers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| why didn't this go to advanced NOCs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| And, you know, what's the big rush to get this done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| I mean, you know, sometimes in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| it seems like the folks up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| they try to solve a problem that doesn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| and I just don't want us to be solving a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| And when you only have 19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| which some of those would have been withdrawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| I don't see that we really have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| I would say, as far as it relates to advanced NOCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| advanced NOCs is a land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| What we're really talking about with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| is a code amendment that is a zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| So that's one of the things that I think we want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| once advanced NOCs gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| but I would believe that to be a secondary step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| because the land use plan should come first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| and then the zoning code update comes second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| So I would make the case that it would be done secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| And then are you already aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| that this is on the NOCs planning agenda for June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| Yes, I believe when I spoke to Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| she had advertised it for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| Is she the originator of doing that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Well, I think she put Knox County as the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| because it did come from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| So I think the applicant would be Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| On 19 since 2008, what has been the numbers the last two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| I think in calendar years, including this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| calendar years 20, 21, and 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| I think it was six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| It's been a higher percentage the last few years, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| Of those cases in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| did BCA ever overturn the Planning Commission staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Not the most recent ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| I think we went back and found two instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| in the total time frame, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| that they did, I guess, overturn the MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5461)|
| 1:31:10| We have a motion on the floor from Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| with a second by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| to approve this resolution to ask the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| to study this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| If I could take just a moment to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| I think there's problems with the language in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| and I think it's something that needs to be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| It's kind of like the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Once you start pulling the onion back, you find veins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| and we're at a point that we can't work de facto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| from this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| If we have a problem, we need to fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| because it will cause legal issues moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| It could, but it's one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| that a court eventually would probably resolve if it came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| Jurisdiction is always an issue in these matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| and so we have to determine where the proper jurisdiction is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| And I'm open to whatever comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| and what this body decides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| If you want BZA to hear things, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| If you want appeals to come to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| I'll be fine with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| I just want us to be on solid ground moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| with the process we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| The motion is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Let the record reflect Commissioner Schoonmaker was a no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| so the motion passes 10 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| This is item number 62,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| consideration of a resolution approving an economic impact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| submitted by the Industrial Development Board of the County of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| in connection with the multi-use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| founded by Kingston Pike and Concord Road in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| to be known as the Biddle Farm Farragut Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| This is resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| I have a motion to approve by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| and a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| Commissioner Smith, your line is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| First, I want to say I am going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| but I have some questions and some things that I want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| so that we all know where we're at with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| This is much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| A tiff with Farragut than it is with the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| With the City of Knoxville, the tax increment financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| that comes from property tax generated from the project is split 60 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| The city pays 60% of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| We pay 40% of it because of our tax structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| When we do one alone, it's all on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| but we typically do this in a place like Grassy Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| where we get a cash register into the county where we get the revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5659)|
| 1:34:25| With the city, they give 72% of their sales tax to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| The county gives 72% of their sales tax to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| and 28% goes to our general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Now, in a development like this that's within the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| that has no property tax, we'll be paying for the tax financing increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| solely with Knox County new generated tax dollars from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| and only 50% of the sales tax will go to our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| which is a reduction from what everybody else pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| Now, how much will that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| How many people will not go to businesses in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| and go there and move that money downward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| But I am going to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| basically in the spirit of cooperation with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| I want them to see that we're here to help them support their goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220523-business?start=5727)|
