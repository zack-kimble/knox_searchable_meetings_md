| 0:11:40| This resolution shall take effect from and after its passage of welfare of the city requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| I got to know Lynn like a lot of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| You know, if you ran for your office, pretty soon someone, really a lot of people, would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| have you talked to Lynn Redman? That's the person you need to talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| So eventually I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| The one thing I really noticed in my time on council is just how much local media has waned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| And I think we're going to need a lot more people like Lynn Redman that are really following local issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| that really spend the time to get to know all the candidates, know their backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| And he did it out of love of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| And he found what he thought candidates that were in it for the right reasons and supported them and advised them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=748)|
| 0:12:36| So I will certainly miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=756)|
| 0:12:39| I know a lot of people and colleagues that are interested in good local government will miss him as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=759)|
| 0:12:47| And I think there's, I wanted to give you a chance to speak, but I think, I know Mr. Silverstein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| there may be others that wanted to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| Yeah, Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Did you want to say something first or pull down the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| You mentioned a skilled orator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| What you're going to get from me is nothing like that, but I'm going to give it my best shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=795)|
| 0:13:19| Okay, so what about Lynn Redman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Who was he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| What did he accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| What was important to him and what did he think about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| What did he think about at the end of a great day when all the lists were completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| all the numbers added up, and even his printer worked like a dream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| What did he think about on those days that weren't so perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=822)|
| 0:13:48| One word keeps returning to me whenever I try to answer these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| Useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Lynn was useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| When he thought about how he wanted to live his life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| I believe he decided on purpose that he wanted to be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Useful to his neighborhood and to his city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| He wanted to be useful to the people that God had surrounded him with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| Useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| It is a privilege to accept this resolution on behalf of Lynn's daughters and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you to the members of the Knoxville City Council for honoring Lynn tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| and for remembering him with fondness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=881)|
| 0:14:58| Larry, did you want to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| On behalf of the members of Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| I want to thank City Council for this resolution to honor the memory of Lynn Redman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| who was a founding member of Community Forum in 1987.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| Lynn Redman spoke many times at this very podium at meetings of City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| County Commission, and MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Lynn spoke passionately on behalf of his beloved Norwood neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| but really on behalf of all neighborhoods in the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Lynn commanded the respect of everybody who knew him because of his wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| his determination, his persuasiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and his knowledge about the history of what took place in the community in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=947)|
| 0:15:53| Lynn didn't have to yell to make his points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| which were based on reason and logic and common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| and a basic sense of what was right or wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| and in the best interest of average people who would be affected by the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Lynn is greatly missed by members of Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| We miss his big smile and his sense of humor and his mild manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| We could always count on Lynn to be with us to help advocate on behalf of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Those of us who knew and worked with Lynn know that because of the hard work of Lynn Redman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| Knoxville and Knox County is a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Our memory of Lynn will motivate us to continue his good works in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Our condolences go out to his family and friends who he loved so dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you again for this resolution to acknowledge the contributions of a good and kind man, Lynn Redman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I also want to recognize Chairman Randy Smith of County Commission who's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| and May and Jack Moody, all of who worked closely with Lynn over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| Also, I gave a personal tribute to Lynn at the Neighborhood Conference a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| and won't repeat that other than to say when I think of Lynn, it is, I think, the long game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| That was what he understood, that the work that we do, you may not win today, but you might win tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1045)|
| 0:17:32| Good and reasonable people disagree. He's sort of the epitome of understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| Council or the mayor might not support him on one issue, but we'd be his biggest ally on another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| I see other folks in the audience who understand that and they are here for the long game as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| That's the type of citizen participation that we need and understand that we don't always agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| but that we all want a better Knoxville and we keep plugging away at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| meeting after meeting, month after month, year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| That's what he certainly did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Our warmest thoughts to the family, to the friends, and to those who share their devotion and love with us for Lynn Redmond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1087)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1097)|

| 0:20:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| I just had a question for engineering, I guess, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| So the initial amount that was approved for this was for a design that's not going to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| and now we're approving an additional amount for, like, a change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| Yeah, Jim Hagerman, director of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| That's essentially correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| The original design, the original materials that they decided on the design approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| just didn't meet the needs of the fleet, so we took a step and went in a different direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1252)|
| 0:21:02| to change the design so that it's a more conventional construction method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| which is more effective, more efficient space-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| There's more space inside because there's not as much structure in the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| And the other thing that was decided was that with the conventional construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| they'd get more competitive bids, so the ultimate price would probably be lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| So in looking at our packet, so part of the issue with building on that property is because it used to be landfill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| But we've also already built the existing fire structures that are there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| Are they also on landfill property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| I believe that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| That whole site is a challenging site, and so fleet and engineering had an original design concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| that they were moving forward with, and because of the location and the geotechnical work we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265180703?start=1314)|
