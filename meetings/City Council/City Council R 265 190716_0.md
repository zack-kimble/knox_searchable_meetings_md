| 0:02:02| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=122)|

| 0:02:06| Thank you. You got a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| Any opposed? The minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| Items for postponement. We have a couple items that we would like postponed. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=136)|
| 0:02:22| Thank you, Mayor. There are four items I would like to ask for postponement. Item 11I and J and 11L and M for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=142)|
| 0:02:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| So that is the impound lot. I and J on the impound lot and L and M on the contract dealing with the public safety complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=159)|
| 0:02:49| The two items. Ready to vote? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Any opposed? The ayes have it. And those four items are postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| Anything else for postponement? Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| The consent items. We don't have any consent items today. So now the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| So there's a lot more I could report, but for the sake of getting through this agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| I just want to bring up that the Community Development Department launched its planning for the five-year consolidated plan last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=199)|
| 0:03:29| In an unusual way, the staff set up a booth in the City-County building and asked passersby to complete the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| Knoxville needs dot, dot, dot, fill in the blank. So people wrote on sticky notes, which were then posted and which prompted a lot more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| Responses ranged from more help for the homeless and affordable housing to better access to substance abuse treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| more parks and children friendly activities and many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| So input will be gathered through September and six public meetings are scheduled in August and September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| for residents to get information, ask questions and provide feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| What people tell us will help prioritize the community's needs for affordable housing and services for homeless individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| veterans, single mothers and other groups. So we do need to hear from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| This, again, we do an annual plan, but this is the five-year plan that really actually guides our annual plan for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| So the easiest and quickest way to share with us your priorities is to take an online survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| You can visit our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov slash development to participate in the survey or to get information on the upcoming public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=272)|
| 0:04:45| There are several meetings scheduled, six meetings scheduled in August and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| You can also call 311 and ask for the meeting schedule there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| So please get involved. We'd love to hear from you, either online or in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| That is the end of my report. Any reports of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| Yes. I would like to make sure everyone's aware, because we don't have another council meeting coming up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| that the Uptown North Broadway Bash is coming up on Saturday, July 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| That's an event that's going to be held in the Broadway Shopping Center with the North Knoxville Business and Professional Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| There's going to be kids' activities, including inflatables, antique cars, as well as the very successful event from last year that was the brainchild,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=324)|
| 0:05:36| I believe, of Councilman Roberto, which is the Stuff the Bus event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| That is tax-free holiday for school supplies that particular day, that whole weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| We'd like to invite you to come out to the Uptown North Broadway Bash and help stuff the bus from 12 to 4 there at the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| Those are school supplies for Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| They use those to pull during the school year and supply students with things like backpacks, pens, markers, tissues, hand sanitizer, spiral notebooks, binders, and notebook paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=359)|
| 0:06:11| If you would like to grab a few extra supplies when you're out on tax-free weekend and bring those by, that event runs from 12 to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| That's both Stuff the Bus and the Broadway Bash there in the Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=379)|

| 0:07:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| I'd like to share an event that's going on July 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| It's a mayoral candidates event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| It's put on by Community Voices Coalition, which is a group that has come together from some of the lowest incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=470)|
| 0:07:59| So it should be a pretty interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| The questions will be quite different than what have been asked before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=482)|

| 0:08:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| I just wanted to recognize that former Councilwoman Barbara Pilo is here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| a former Councilperson from the 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Welcome, Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=501)|
| 0:08:31| We also have Councilwoman Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| But we see her more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Good to have you all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| We're now on resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Seed Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| to provide $43,000 in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Lead Hazard Control funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| to carry out an outreach program in targeted neighborhoods for education and enrollment in lead-based paint remediation programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| I would like to recuse myself on this vote as I'm a volunteer at Seed and involved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I just wanted to ask Becky Wade just kind of generally what the measurement tools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| and how do you, when we're going door-to-door and checking this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| how do you measure that this is how often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| and how do we measure that this is our success with that program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| This is a new grant that we are doing with our new Lead Hazard Control Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| We were awarded $3.6 million from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| and this will be a new effort for community outreach to engage families in certain neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=581)|
| 0:09:49| where there's a predominance of lower-income families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| predominance of older housing built 1978 or before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| and where there's a large number of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| because those are the factors that go into what could have lead paint in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| the house age plus it's more detrimental to children under the age of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| And so we've contracted with Seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| We'll be contracting with them to go door-to-door, educate people about the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=617)|
| 0:10:24| do some prescreening, and sign them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| And I believe their goal is 500 families over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=634)|

| 0:10:52| Hi, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| My name is Stan Johnson, 2805 Woodbine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 3791.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thanks for coming out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| This is our new process with working with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| We want to make sure that people in these underserved communities are also hearing the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| We've been really working in our community to make sure that young people have jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| and also the people that are in these communities that are affected by this information get that information first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| I just heard about the new survey that you guys are going to be doing for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| I hope we can get involved in that as well because just doing it online, not saying it's not a good process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| but going door-to-door is the most ways that these young people get their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| So we just want to make sure that people are getting the information directly from community residents that actually live and are affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| And you're training your people how to engage with the homeowner, the tenant there, the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| So it's kind of training on both sides, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| We want to make sure that these young people are not just being recognized as people that are doing the violence in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| but they're also helping train our community members in the effects of lead paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| so that way we can actually help kill two birds with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Thank you, Stan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| I just wanted to thank Mr. Johnson and see the program does some tremendously good work in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| and so I just wanted to recognize him and his staff and volunteers for the work that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| And this isn't the first time we've contracted with SEED on one of our projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| He's worked several others with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| Are you finished there, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=758)|

| 0:13:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=808)|

| 0:13:31| 11D is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Jones Brothers Contractors, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| for an amount not to exceed $1,188,554.14 for the Mineral Springs Avenue Bridge Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I just wanted to point out that one of the things that wasn't included in the packet was diagrams or drawings of this bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=828)|
| 0:13:55| and so I had some back and forth with Director Hagerman this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| The Greenway Corridors Plan that was put out several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| this is actually the route that the Greenway will take to get towards Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| which is one thing I get a lot of requests about, is getting that connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| And so we had multiple messages today to confirm that it is big enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| and once we spend this money we'll have to spend more money to make the bridge bigger for the Greenway to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| So I appreciate the staff getting the information to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| and I'm excited that we're laying a foundation for that to happen in the future, one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Thank you for verifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| 11E is a resolution authorizing the Mayor or her designee to execute all documents necessary to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| Elmington Capital Group to construct a retaining wall and small portion of fencing in a public right-of-way of Hollywood Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| at no cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Director Hagerman, let me address this with you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| It looks like what we're dealing with here is a lot of response from some of the concerns we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| or the neighborhood had originally about water and then line of sight regarding traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| The constraint that we put on the development was that it not flood the road any more than it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| It doesn't flood the road in a 25-year event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| The only way that they could come up with doing that was to raise the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| I guess you can say the sight distance improvements, which are significant, were sort of gravy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| because it was really designed around the flooding issue and the retention on site of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=954)|
| 0:16:06| But we get both benefits and there's a sidewalk that goes all the way up to the end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=966)|
| 0:16:15| Right, that's what I was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| So there's also sidewalk repair and new sidewalk as a part of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| So many of the issues that we heard from the neighborhood that they wanted addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| flooding, traffic with line of sight, and then additional sidewalks and repair, all are getting met here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| And Mr. Shepard, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=999)|
| 0:16:51| Go ahead and introduce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| John Shepard with Elmington Capital Group, 118 16th Avenue South, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| I did have a message from one person in the neighborhood who asked about a delay to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| but I understand you're under some time constraint with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| The project has been awarded more than $10 million in federal tax credits to help finance the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| and those are on a deadline that expires relatively soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| So, I mean, normally I'd want to have some time for the neighborhood to be able to talk to you about it beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| but since time is of the essence here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| and really what we're doing is addressing the issues that the neighborhood wanted us to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I'm comfortable with proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| They do have a neighborhood meeting this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Is that something you think you could send somebody to to maybe give them an update on what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I'll get with you later so I can make sure I get you the information and where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Because they did request that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| So I'm good with approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| I think our motion's already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you, Mr. Shepard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1085)|

| 0:18:10| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Barge Design Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1092)|

| 0:18:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1111)|

| 0:18:40| necessary for easements and certain associated expenses within property located at 409 Bidel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1120)|

| 0:18:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Mr. Swanson, if you need to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Yeah, if somebody's willing to do it, we need to get an amendment to this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Actually, an amendment in three places because the address is transposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| It's listed as 409 Bidel Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| It should be 904 Bidel Street, and so we need to get an amendment that will change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| address to 904 Bidel rather than 409 Bidel, and that correction would occur in the caption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| in the second whereas, and in the first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| So one motion will cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Move to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Okay, so first we vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay, so all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Now we go back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| And that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Does that settle what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I think that handles it, and thank you to Councilman Ryder for calling that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| She was quick enough to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Someone sent it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| I don't take credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| That's why I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| There's a lot of wise people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| I couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| I was like, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Take credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| You couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| You had the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| And then GPS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Number H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Robin Easter Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| to provide professional design services for the urban wilderness wayfinding and branding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| for one year in an amount not to exceed $50,000 and no dollars, with the option to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| the term for two additional one-year terms at an hourly rate of $150 and no cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yeah, so is Cheryl Healy here, or you can answer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Maybe David Bryce can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Yeah, Rebecca Jane Montgomery is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| She'll come out and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| So it's just the use of the LEAF logo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| Is that what we're talking about using out there, the continuation of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| And do we own that LEAF, or who owns that LEAF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| That's actually protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| It's a symbol that's protected that's part of Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| We have an agreement with them to use it to have a common brand throughout the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| This is really about, you know, the urban wilderness is city, county, private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| And so this is about trying to have consistent signage and wayfinding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| especially if we have new facilities that come online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| But Rebecca Jane can talk more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Hi, Rebecca Jane Montgomery, the Urban Wilderness Coordinator for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| This contract is really to continue the use of the existing brand and styles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| throughout the new park elements, and also to update existing signage as necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| throughout the trail system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| So part of that's the LEAF, but much further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| But the LEAF is owned by Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| Yeah, it's owned by Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| We're excited to use it, and that will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| We're going to continue to use that throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Yeah, you know, assuming that we follow their guidelines for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| And we have, in the last contract with them, we had formalized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| They've always been incredibly supportive, and we've been supportive of them on this common branding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| So this is really about bringing together all the partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| and I think, Rebecca Jane, there's Urban Wilderness Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| which is city, county, Aslan, Iams, all those parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| and making sure that we have the resources to have consistency of branding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I just wondered, I had a similar question about who owns that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| We hired an in-house graphic designer last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| so I'm wondering why they couldn't do that work instead of an outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Dan will help with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Dan has quite a bit of work on his plate right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| Basically, he's the first designer, graphic designer, that the city has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| Robin Easter has also had significant experience with the urban wilderness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| so there's really, she already has all of that knowledge and experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| and it actually worked on the original design materials that we're trying to implement throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And so this is a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| This is to allow us to have up to 50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| It doesn't mean we would spend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| It's to have Robin on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| They will work with Dan as well, so that's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1395)|

| 0:24:18| We are glad to add a tenant representative to the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Does that need to be part of the motion, or can that be part of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| You can amend it to include a tenant representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Then we'll have to come back later, and unless you have the specific name in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| we'll come back later and then add that name by new resolution appointing that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1475)|

| 0:25:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| Okay, now we're back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Councilwoman Welch, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I just wanted to note that I served on the Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| I served on the Stakeholder Advisory Committee prior to being elected to office, prior to running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| and I conferred with our legal counsel today to make sure that it would be okay for me to vote on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| and he tells me that I can vote despite that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| Because it's very clear we do not pay you extra to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| You have no financial benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I might be owed payment for it, but in any case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I also wanted to acknowledge that there are several folks who have served or will be continuing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| I think I saw Caroline Cooley, Pat Phillips, Gail Atherton, Mary English, and John Sanders out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1543)|
| 0:25:53| and there may be others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Oh, Amy Nolan, I think, is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| So there may be others that I missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Did we miss anybody else who's on the Stakeholder Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| They've put a ton of work in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| There has been a ton of work on the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| We appreciate you serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| We appreciate you being willing to continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| I just wanted to ask, so to speak to what this body will continue to do moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| and to some of the feedback that we've gotten in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| Gerald or Director Green or Mr. Director Ahrens, if he's around somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| we've always had zoning, and that's been obvious from some of the feedback we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| A lot of people aren't aware of the zoning that led to their property being built as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| or, you know, it overlays their property already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| As over time, how have amendments to the zoning code come about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| and how will they get triggered to go to the Stakeholders Committee in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| Gerald Green, Director of Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| In the past, they've come staff-initiated, planning commission-initiated, city council-initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| Some come from the residents and property owners in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| Those are wording amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| That's putting the wording amendments in one category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Most of the rezonings of property, which we hear quite often here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| are initiated by the property owner or their representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| That process has been used in this community and other communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| It's established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| The basic process was established by federal enabling legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| and state enabling legislation in the 20s and 30s of the last century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| The way they will come to the Stakeholders Committee would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| one of the charges of the Stakeholder Committee members is to be a liaison to their constituency group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| They may bring them through that liaison activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Our staff may become aware through conversations with property owners and residents of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| that there's a need for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| The staff would then present that to the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| City Council may identify some and direct them to be reviewed by the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| The Planning Commission may identify some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Pat Phillips, whose name was mentioned, is a member of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| and he may pick those up from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and then present them to the Stakeholder Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| So there's a wide range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| What we really want is for the citizens of the city of Knoxville and the property owners of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| to realize that a zoning ordinance is a dynamic living ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and it's currently amended monthly with the rezonings, and we want that to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| We want this document to address the needs and the concerns of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| and its residents and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| So will there be anything in place to say, to analyze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| hey, we notice this is constantly going to this type of thing, whatever X, continually goes to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| We are doing that now, and we're building an even stronger relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| with the Plans Review and Inspections Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| One of our staff persons, Amy Brooks, our Manager of Planning Services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| attends every city BZA meeting, meets with the city staff prior to those meetings with the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| and is well aware of the requests that go to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| and is keeping track of those needs, and we'll continue that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Okay, so we have a motion and a second on the resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| 11-0 is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute a three-month extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| to an agreement with Golden Gloves Charities Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1790)|

| 0:30:06| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| 11-P is the resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1807)|

| 0:30:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| Chad West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| How did we get here on a short-term, middle-of-the-season contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1865)|
| 0:31:12| Sure, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Chad West, City Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Definitely an odd time to bid this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| We bid it out in the winter months to start in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and our contractor did not do a very good job, may have been noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| and we had to let them go at the end of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| so we had to re-bid this contract, and that's why it's coming to you now in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| And you had a minority-owned company bid on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| And they were not successful in the low bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| You made every effort to make that effort, but it didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| That is correct in both cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| The local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Yeah, we went through our normal procurement guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| and it was an evaluated bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Price is 70% of the cost of the evaluation on the bid, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| yes, they were not the lowest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| 11R is the resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| to negotiate and accept from Blueprint Group LLC payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| with respect to property located at 835 North Central Street, 1117 Pruitt Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1936)|
| 0:32:23| parcel ID numbers 094-DQ-032, 094-DQ-021, and 094-DQ-01201, respectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1943)|
| 0:32:32| and responding such payments are deemed to be in the furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 7-53-305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1957)|

| 0:32:46| I actually have some questions, and we're going to have Ms. Foster speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| but I have a motion for an amendment to go along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| In discussions with Ms. Foster, the parcel 094-DQ-01201,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| which is one of the lots that the owner has acquired for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| does not have a value placed on it right now by the tax assessor, and it will probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| I may be speaking, I get this correct, it will likely be reappraised and reassessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| The motion to approve with amendment, so the amendment is to authorize the chief policy officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| to perform administrative actions regarding the pilot in the event that the tax value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| as assessed by Knox County, changes on that parcel, 094-DQ-01201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| That is your motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| All right, any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| So what do you think will come of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So they'll apply a value to that lot, and it won't be 15 years, it will be less than 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| No, I'm going to let Ms. Foster explain it, but if they go and they, right now it's assessed at zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| and if it is assessed at a higher rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Don Michelle Foster, Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| And this has happened on several occasions where we have recommended with the city IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| for our chief policy officer and deputy to the Mayor Bill Lyons to make an administrative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| so it won't bounce back and forth to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| In this case, when the property was bought for Axle Logistics as part of its development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| there was no assessed tax value on the property yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| It's going back to, after talking to Barry Mathis with the Knox County Property Processor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| it will be assessed in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| From that time, as they establish their pilot terms, they will probably have a value at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| and it will be adjusted in their term of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| It's a parcel that's going to be used for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| The main building is at 835 North Central, which has a tax value on it, as well as the second parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| It's the only parcel that's outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| If I could add one thing to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| When the property is assessed, that will set what the value is that the pilot will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| in lieu of payment in lieu of taxes payments will be, rather than the zero that it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Councilman, did you have more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Oh, well, yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I'm sorry, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| I just wanted to ask her, or Bill, how we, this is a little unusual on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| It involves jobs and not necessarily property improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| So, speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| It didn't require a third-party review, as some of them did, and talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| This one is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| The public interest here isn't purely the improvement of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| which is a secondary interest, and we're glad it's a real benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| The real benefit to the city here is the attraction of very good jobs with a local company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2156)|
| 0:36:03| and the very high prospect that those jobs will increase over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| So, we're making sure that actual logistics stays not only in Knoxville but in Knox County in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| So, it's a job creation slash retention, and also has the secondary benefit of bringing about a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| But there isn't really a but-for that would apply here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| other than I guess you could say the but-for was that the jobs would very well go somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| It looks like over 15 years, the value that they're gaining is a little over $2 million out of city taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| And a little over $3 million, or almost $4 million, when you combine city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| And to attract those jobs into that really vacant, delinquent building is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2202)|
| 0:36:49| We think that's very much in the interest of the city, not only because it brings in these are very high-paying jobs, retains them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| Here, it also brings customers to other businesses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| It does bring the building back to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| And we think it would be also a tremendous start for many structures in that area to come back as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| So, we get many benefits from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| We've got investments in the laundry building right next door to it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| Okay. No, that's good. I think that's a good move, and I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I have some questions about the extra lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Is there, you know, the pilot, they're investing I think $17 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| I think that's the right amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| So, I understand a pilot for that piece of property, but not to include the other parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| And I was under the impression city and county, what they would be having advantage of was about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2259)|
| 0:37:46| Well, the lot is necessary as part of the entire package to allow them to use the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| to have the required parking they would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| So, that is in conjunction with the entire package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So, the taxes that might come in the lot are included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Do we know how much that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I mean, I know it hasn't been assessed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| Well, we don't know what the appraised value would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| I don't think it would be excessively high, and I'm not sure what metric the assessor uses in going to a property like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| but it would definitely be north of zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| So, the taxes that we would be missing on that particular parcel wouldn't be particularly high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| because the parking lots are not appraised at high value when they're not used for commercial purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| but rather to supplement a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| I mean, it just adds to the pilot, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| My question is not about Councilwoman Ryder's amendment, so I'm not sure if I should hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| Are we speaking only to the amendment at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Because we're supposed to be, but I'm not sure I've enforced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| I thought we were addressing all issues the way we were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Well, I'm happy to ask my question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Well, let's vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Are there any more questions about the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| I made a motion for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Did anybody second the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| The amendment passes, and now, Councilwoman, on the resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| And this is just a continuation of Councilmember Wallace's comments and questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| So, Donna Schell, are there provisions in place to ensure that the economic and job creation targets are met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| And if they're not, is there any trigger to kind of change the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| In regards to the job measurement, there will be performance and default provisions as a condition in the pilot term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| When they go to CDIDB, they will establish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| CDIBD has a methodology to track job wages and job performance and number of jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| And how does that then impact the pilot if those targets that are set by CBID are not met?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| There's some language of default there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| I can't speak on behalf of what that is in regards to the representative of the general council that writes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| But it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| It will be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Well, Councilwoman Welch just asked one of my primary questions that I had with Ms. Foster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| which was how do we make sure that these jobs go here versus they've chosen to make this their headquarters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| but how do we know that they stay here and not go to any of their two other locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| I would like to ask Mr. Petrie to elaborate on a couple points, if he's here, about the plans for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| And I will introduce that by saying as someone who lives down the street from this in this neighborhood in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2450)|
| 0:40:59| this is going to be very impactful to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| This is one of the largest developable buildings in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| and this is one of the largest investments in the area since a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| So please tell us what the plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| and how the pilot hinges around what the plans might be for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| My name is Joe Petrie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| I own Conversion Properties, 520 West Summit Hill, Suite 903, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2483)|
| 0:41:30| And I'm here on behalf of the Blueprint Group, which is the same ownership as Axel Logistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| We're a fee developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| We don't have any personal financial interests other than our fee, of course, in developing the property for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| These are two South Knoxville-reared guys, John Clay and Drew Johnson, graduates of South Dole High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| graduates of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| came out, worked for larger corporations in the logistics field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| and a few years ago started their own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| So I came to know the two individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| One was actually a renter of ours in college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| but I came to know them as a company when we introduced them to the Langley building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| They came in with eight employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| That was about four, four and a half years ago, if my memory serves me well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| And now they have, I'm losing track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| So it was, at last count, 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| So eight to 78 in about that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| We are developing this building and designing the building to hold up to between 300 and 350 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2554)|
| 0:42:44| They do have other offices in Nashville, Chattanooga, but they're from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| They recruit highly out of the University of Tennessee logistics program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and that's very important to the development of this building, or I should say the converse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| The building development is very important to the recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| This is the tool that they'll use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| So you may or may not know that there are four to five large logistics companies in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2586)|
| 0:43:14| They're in the Millers building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| They're in the First Tennessee building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| They've been in the Langley building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| So this is a way for this ownership to own their own building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and control that growth through controlling the real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| And so that's the whole purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| It is a corporate headquarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| It is their intent to grow where they're planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| And I don't think we can even calculate the ancillary benefit of all the jobs that can come to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| Selfishly, my company is developing three projects in that small vicinity within two blocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| probably either way, for probably $6.5 million or so roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| And we're doing some apartments, so guess where we hope our apartment dwellers will come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| These are really well-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| They are commission-based, but they start around the $50,000 a year range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| and within about three years they average $150,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| And so we think all those employees will be paying it forward into the community that they're walking to and from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| And to your point about the parking lot and where that is in proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| they've got a variance for 10 parking spaces for this 43,000-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| Everybody knows that's not enough, and so they've been very forward-thinking in buying the other lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| It's a block away, I guess you should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And they're providing their own parking for whatever that holds for as long as it holds it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| and then they'll have to make other arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Well, looking forward to seeing this progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| It's been a long time coming to see this whole block develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| I agree, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| All right, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to vote on the resolution as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2700)|

| 0:47:36| Read this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| 12F is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville to regulate the location, height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2857)|

| 0:47:55| residence, recreation, public activities, and other purposes, and for such purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| to divide the municipality into districts or zones of such numbers, space, and areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2879)|

| 0:48:24| amendments thereto, all as a product of the public process known as Recode Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| So we are on Recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| Just a little reminder, a little background as we get started here, you all will recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| that this proposed ordinance has been discussed and amended at special called council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| on May 14th and 30th, and then postponed for six and a half weeks to this meeting in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| to give plenty of time for public review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| The ordinance was also amended and approved again by the Knoxville and Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2935)|
| 0:49:00| Commission at their June 13th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| During the month of June, council members had the opportunity to meet one-on-one with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2943)|
| 0:49:08| our Planning Director, Gerald Green, to review and submit any comments or questions or proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| revisions to the Zoning Map, which is in its final draft, in terms of drafts, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| Draft 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| So, at last council meeting on July 2nd, I recommended a plan on how to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2963)|
| 0:49:33| and so I'll just review that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| There are two different pieces to Recode or to our Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| One is the actual text of the document, all the words on paper here, and the other is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| the Zoning Map, how these zones are actually applied on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| So, my recommendation, without objection from council, is to begin by reviewing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| text of the zoning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| We have worksheets that we have been working off of, thanks to our law department, Christina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| who's kept up on all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| We will start with review of the council-initiated revisions and start going through there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3009)|
| 0:50:18| take whatever action is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| We will then review, and this all has been online and available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| We also have the updated worksheet of staff-initiated revisions, which is what I have on the blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| paper here, and we will take action as appropriate or desired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| We then want to review the Planning Commission's June 13th amendments that's actually incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| into this and take action as appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| And then, after those are done, if there are any other amendments that any council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| members want to recommend, then we'll also deal with these in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| Then council can decide where they are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Are they ready to vote on this, on first reading, or do they need more information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Following that, I propose that we begin looking at the Zoning Map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| As I said, it's Draft 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I would ask Mr. Green to give a general review of Draft 4 of the Zoning Map, and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| would review and take action as appropriate on proposed revisions to Draft 4 of the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| as recommended by council and by the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Also in the packet was another worksheet, which listed the proposed revisions to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Zoning Map, and the first 16 or so were submitted by Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| And then the following 17 through 33 were presented by planning staff, and so we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| We'd go through them, and then action would be taken as appropriate from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| And then we'll open it up and see if there's any other actions that council wants to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| And then council will determine, do they need more information, or are they ready to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3123)|
| 0:52:10| on first reading on the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| So, council, is there any objection to any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| I also want, council, there are several people that have signed up for recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| I want to check with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I think some of them probably just want to be on here in case a matter comes up as we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| going through the revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Others may be here to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| And so, without objection, we'll go through here and see what each of these individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| just to clarify why they have signed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Mr. Silverstein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Silverstein?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| I always get that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| You're going to make a statement now, or you're going to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Ms. Malone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Larry Dearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| You'll wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Constance Everey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| Ms. Everey, are you here to make a statement to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| Would you like to make a statement now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Well, is there a particular item that you're going to speak on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| Some of these folks will speak on specific items if they come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| She's going to speak against it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3195)|
| 0:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Well, then, I want you to start walking forward, please, because we will call on you in just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Sarah Elizabeth Rowland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| Elizabeth Rowland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| I want to speak on the residential occupancy figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| So when we start talking about that, please work your way towards the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| And Michael Conrad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I want to speak on the development in residential areas around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| It's affected state properties and a lot of places that don't have some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| I couldn't hear all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| So is that a specific issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Is that a specific issue that we're going to come to, or it's a general statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Lot sizes or divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Sarah, can you come forward and just state that, and then we'll know whether to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| and let you speak after Ms. Every or whether we'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| And what is it that you're here to speak about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| I'm here to speak about people that have properties now that are in residential areas that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| like, an acre and a half, two acres, developers coming in and buying that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| and then having it rezoned into two pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| And it's actually taken away from our community to making it rezoned, you know, to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| a, where you put four or five dwellings on that one piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| And we don't want that in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| So hold on a second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| So that's a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| So if you would just step aside for a moment and let Ms. Every speak, and then I'll call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| on you, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And then we want to hear your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| So Ms. Every, please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Let's get our information up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Do you have the timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Technical problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| I can always, as we're doing that, I'll go ahead and set my timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| Well, it's 7-12 to record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| So will you start your timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Ms. Every, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| My name is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| My home record is 301 North Charlie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| So we're going to discuss the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| The thing about, for me, the recode is actually I'm not even against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I do believe that Knoxville has grown and expanded, and we do need to go look back at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| 50 years' worth of documentation to make sure that it's actually servicing our growth and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| infrastructure as we expand as a community and as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| However, there is no way anyone in this building or anyone that's in a recode project can convince| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| me that in two years' time frame, you all have went through 50 years' worth of documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| blueprints, maps, and other information that will really help you make the proper decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| behind recoding and say that it is an agenda that really includes every single not civilian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| It is too much documentation to comb through and really take a real insight to what these rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| regulations are affecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| Like, for example, have you realized that some of the things that recoding could do, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| about people that are small-time entrepreneurs that have in-home businesses can be affected by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Or what about the homeless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I have looked at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| There are maps, information that I went and saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| And I'm looking at these maps, and I see no inclusion of any type of projects for homeless development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| or growth as far as with their housing needs in the sense that they have as homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| The other fact I also look at is I've seen the maps, and there are places where, you have to be honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| it is also showing the agendas of gentrification taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Because on some of those maps it shows things that's called low density versus high density population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| At first I didn't understand it, because there was an area that is now no longer Walter P.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| but called Five Points, that was considered a low density population at the time I looked at that map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| at New Harvest Center sometime last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| When I looked at that, I thought, there is a heavy population present there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| However, today it is a low density population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| So you could be marking where you're doing your gentrification developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| And then I look at this picture, and I look at it more where they have the area marked off as known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| Northeast Knoxville and North Central Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Well, those extensions of that map are extending down into what is known as East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| and the Lonsdale area community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| So really what this whole agenda hide behind is really expanding downtown Knoxville is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| That's what I look at when I look at recoding, how you are basically being deceptive behind your extension of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| And there's nothing bad about it, but don't lie about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| Tell the truth about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Because this is something that basically we feel pressure of a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| I just watched you give $1.1 million to a contractor to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| But we got over 300,000, I'm sorry, about roughly 3,000 homeless people right now in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| No, there's something wrong with that picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| That can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| If we're going to develop infrastructure, we need to consider things that really need development and infrastructure in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| And that's not the way we need to be spending our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| I come with a message of hope today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| This is where the people come back with the power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| See, right now this city is going through a dynamic, radical change election as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| And some people are going to come in here that's going to stand up for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| So that's why we, as the people, got to make sure we vote for these people that are going to come in here and talk some sense into some of y'all about the things that need to come first when we talk about infrastructure of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3511)|
| 0:58:41| Rezoning needs to be reconsidered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| And therefore, it is not the proper agenda for this community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| I'm not against it, but it definitely needs to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| If you sit here and vote through a two-year evaluation of 50 years' worth of documentation, I can't say that I can trust you with any decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| And that means, like as we've already been calling, it's time to clean house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| So I say again, recoding is not the answer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| We really need real evaluation of people input to what is going on as far as with this recode agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3551)|
| 0:59:19| Michael Conrad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3561)|
| 0:59:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| I agree with mainly what this lady just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| Well, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3565)|
| 0:59:26| And you see the timer up above my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| If you would just keep an eye on that, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I live 605 Hickory Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| I see all these things like she sees, that the rezoning is just trying to make the city bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| When we rezoned Knox County out here and took all the way out to Emory Road for the city because they needed more tax money, I see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3583)|
| 0:59:52| But it ruined a lot of farms, a lot of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| Now it's nothing but flooded areas because subdivisions have come in and built roads in there and built houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| They took away the tree structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Everything that stops flooding they have took away with new housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| They didn't need to do that, but they needed the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And it's not all about money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| It's sometimes about your personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| I own a huge piece of property right off of Clinton Highway, right inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| Every month I get at least 20 developers come in there and try to buy my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| If they bought my property and developed it, it would flood everybody out below me, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| So I won't sell my piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| And I think that rezoning that area for a residential area to rezone my piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| to where people can come in there and build around it with other stuff and flood my property is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3644)|
| 1:00:51| It's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| And rezoning should not be going on at this present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| I think it needs to be left up to the next administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3660)|
| 1:01:08| So we will now proceed with the council-initiated revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Now, council has their worksheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Did you sign up, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3681)|
| 1:01:28| I'll recognize the gentleman to come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Okay. Yes, sir. Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| In the future, you sign up with the recorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Sir, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Can you name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| Yes, my name is Donald Beamon, and I live at West Jackson Avenue 118, West Jackson, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| And I feel very much the same as that young lady did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I feel the city of Knoxville government is uncaring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| I was beat by one of your police officers one year ago because I was gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| My husband was there, who's black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| We tried to check in, and a gentleman, a clerk there, screamed us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| And one of your officers, Travis Shuler, stood there as a night security guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3731)|
| 1:02:16| and he took the gentleman's word, the clerk's word, that I was being harassing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| when really we had a paid-for room for a hotel at the Tennessean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| But because my husband was black and we were gay, this gentleman screamed us out in hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3747)|
| 1:02:34| just like the—probably very much associated with that officer that spewed the hate against gays recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| and was an officer of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| That's why we question the leadership of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| If they really have a heart for the city, all the people in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| why do my two children go to an L1 school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Why are there L1 schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Why isn't every school treated the same, given the same funding, provided the same rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| have the same education, have the good teachers, have the good principals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| Why is it that after this incident of me being beat, the city didn't respond to my request, Mrs. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| I didn't get a call from the hotel. I didn't get a call from the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| But yet Eddie Maness, who's running for mayor, he applauded the sheriff that's currently in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| And I say we need new management. We need a new government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| We need—this is your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| These—you here are people that are saying you're doing something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| You're caring too much about the people with deep, big pockets, people that can own multiple blocks of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| That's what you care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| And what we care about is knowing that our children can feel safe in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| My two children do not feel safe in Knoxville because your officer beat me because I was gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| And I had to pay $13,000 to clear my name, and he's still an officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| There's a question. The question is what care does your—do each of you have for each of the people that are in your city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3849)|
| 1:04:20| When you're talking about redevelopment, how is it going to impact my children's school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| Are they going to get new funding, better funding, more improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| Are they going to be treated like the kids from West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| Do we have to live in West Knoxville to get recognition by this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| Do we have to work downtown to get recognition by this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| Do we have to go to a church that you attend to get recognition by this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| Do we have to make sure we don't have tattoos on our sleeves to get recognition by this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| Do we have to not be gay to get recognition by the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| What are you doing for diversity in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| When hate is real, what are you doing in the city to really bring about true change and true leadership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| I say Knoxville needs real leadership, and I'm going to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| Each of you are responsible for my attack because everything rises and falls on leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| And this leadership has silenced me, but I'm here to say I'm not silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| Each of you are responsible for the hate that is in Knoxville, for the hurt that is sitting in these seats, because they believe you do not care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3930)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Sir, sir, before you sit down, do you see Ms. Avis Reed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| Raise your hand, Avis, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| Avis is the director of community relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| We have a police advisory review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Yeah, I'm suing the city right now, so they won't talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| And also, I would ask that you talk to Chip Berry, who is our deputy chief of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| He is our LGBT liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| I called your office, and you failed to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| I do not recall having a message from you, but if you would please call Chip Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| I'd like you to know what our city is doing proactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| I'm going to have to stop the conversation because this is actually not on the agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| but we'd be glad to let you know what we are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| The issues you have raised concern all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| And, by the way, most of us don't live in West Knoxville, so we are not biased towards West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| But I would be glad to have folks talk to you about our efforts towards LGBT, towards equality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=3996)|
| 1:06:45| what we do towards our schools and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| We do care, and we'd like for you to know and be able to share with you what we actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you, sir, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| So now we are moving on to the council-initiated revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| There are extra worksheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| So if you want one of these council-initiated worksheets, Fiona and staff-initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| Fiona has some extra copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Just raise your hand, and she will try and spread around among you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4045)|
| 1:07:26| If you're on the council with the council-initiated revisions, if you look on that sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| we actually, if you advance forward, our first item for action is on page 7 of the council-initiated worksheets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4054)|
| 1:07:49| That's the white package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| That is the white package, the council-initiated worksheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4070)|
| 1:08:01| It is page 7 of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| It's page 733 in the council agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| Council, get your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| So if you look at the top of page 7, it's item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| This is dealing with article 2, general definitions and measurements and methodologies, page 2-24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| Council directed staff to revise seven definitions beginning at temporary contractor office and contractor yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4110)|
| 1:08:38| through temporary warehouse sales in a way that does not include the word temporary in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| So staff suggests replacing temporary in the definitions with the term short-term, but leaving the terms unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4125)|
| 1:08:55| The term short-term does not need to be defined because the permit terms are covered in article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| Hopefully, council remembers that conversation from our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| And if you do, I would entertain a motion to approve that staff suggestion in response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| If you go down to number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Okay, this is hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| So we have both items on the council packet and on the staff, the blue packet, the staff revisions, page 8 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4163)|
| 1:09:39| But to simplify things, just to keep it simple, if you look, we have a handout, which is attachment number 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4179)|
| 1:09:50| Is that at everybody's desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| Fiona in the corner has copies in the packets as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Council received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| I had it in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Now mine is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| May I borrow that for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| So this is attachment 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| What Christina in law department has done was incorporate all the different changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4213)|
| 1:10:22| The blue text is the revision that was recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| The green text underlined is per council direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4228)|
| 1:10:38| The first thing to look at, I would think, just to walk us through this, is the yellow highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| This is at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| I'm kind of getting out of whack here from the worksheet, but if we're working off of this, okay, if you look, the yellow highlight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4247)|
| 1:10:55| as council will recall, at one of our previous council meetings, council voted to have the hillside protection overlay apply to all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4255)|
| 1:11:14| Planning commission recommended that it apply in all residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| That is one change that came from the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| Also, Christina or Gerald, do you want to work through the other changes in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Gerald Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| In section B, the green underlying was added to clarify that it's the hillside protection or HP overlay regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| and then apply to, in blue, development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| The green, as noted in the headline, was recommended by council at the last meeting to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4311)|
| 1:11:59| Staff recommends that we put the word development in it to clarify that the standards apply to development of property located within the hillside protection overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4319)|
| 1:12:10| Any questions on that first sentence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Before I get to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| The next on B1, to clarify that this applies to these exemptions, any exemptions in these lists, the exceptions to the hillside protection overlay standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4337)|
| 1:12:31| Legally existing structures, existing as of the effective date of this code, are exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| So if there's an existing legally approved structure, it's exempt, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4358)|
| 1:12:49| On B2, the blue language talks about the exception of lots of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| This exception applies only where the lot of record is one acre or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| And this was requested by the planning commission in their proposed recommendation on the hillside protection overlay language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4380)|
| 1:13:09| This also addresses some of the comments from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| The final change that is on this sheet is on section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| And this provides an option for developers who want flexibility from the strict standards of the hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4400)|
| 1:13:29| The strict standards address density and limitations on grading or land disturbance based on the slope of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| This exception, and I'll read it and then explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| The Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission, following the procedure in Article 16.2.D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| and applying the guidelines of the Knoxville-Knox County Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| may issue a certificate of appropriateness for any application for any deviation from Article 8.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| This provides an option for the planning commission to provide some flexibility in the application of the hillside standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| I'll give the example of a recent development on Hollywood Road where there was a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| In order to protect that slope, the building was moved forward somewhat at the approval of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4454)|
| 1:14:21| So we realize that we have an intent to protect those steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| We have provisions to protect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Sometimes there may be a development that needs some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| This provides an opportunity for that flexibility in a public forum where there would be public input, a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| and the ability of the planning commission to weigh the benefits of protecting the slopes with the benefits of the development being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4478)|
| 1:14:47| Okay, so we'll start discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| Councilwoman Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| I am fine with the changes that you've described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| I have three other things that I'd like to have discussed and added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| The first is that I would like to add to be applicability in that first sentence in all residential and commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4504)|
| 1:15:17| The second is that I would like to see in addition to B, 4, under applicability, another exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4517)|
| 1:15:32| And I can read that if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| This is where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| B2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| It's under applicability B, and it would be in addition to that list of three, so it would be 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| So it would be a fourth exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Lots that have been previously legally disturbed or developed would also be accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| provided that any new or additional disturbance does not exceed the previously disturbed area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4557)|
| 1:16:07| or the maximum land disturbance permitted by Table 8.6 below, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4567)|
| 1:16:17| For the purposes, Christina, I think maybe I sent this to you, but are you typing too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I'll slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| For the purposes of this section, disturbance shall mean any activity that changes the physical conditions of landform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4594)|
| 1:16:47| vegetation, and hydrology, creates bare soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4607)|
| 1:17:00| She's very fast at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| This may cause erosion or sedimentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| Yeah, you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| The third thing that I would like to add is, sorry, let me get back to my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4632)|
| 1:17:22| Sorry, I just hit mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Under C, density and land disturbance limitations, the way that table reads right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4643)|
| 1:17:32| it is applicable to residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| In order to make it make sense with the addition of commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4657)|
| 1:17:47| I'm not sure this is the right legal language, so I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| What I would like to say is maximum density and maximum land disturbance in Table 8.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4670)|
| 1:17:57| are applicable in residential districts that are within the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4677)|
| 1:18:06| Could you go one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| I sure can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Yes, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Maximum density and maximum land disturbance are applicable in Table 8.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4692)|
| 1:18:20| are applicable in residential districts that are within the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| I think that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| And then only the maximum land disturbance is applicable in commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4711)|
| 1:18:38| that are within the HP overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| If I may...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| I may have that wrong, but I think you know what I'm trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| I think it would be clear the first sentence you stated is already stated in the first sentence of Section C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| What we may want to do is state that second sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| the maximum land disturbance is applicable in commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Put that up as the second sentence so I think it reads better and is more understandable that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4740)|
| 1:19:06| As long as it's clear, as long as we're just clarifying how that table is to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| for residential and commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Council Member Welch, did you mean to exclude office districts and industrial districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4757)|
| 1:19:25| I did not mean to exclude them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Should we just remove residential in the first sentence in Section B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| Is that what we're trying to achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Which is what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| State all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| I guess I was just seeing if you wanted to modify your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| just to remove the word residential there in that first sentence of Section B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So that will be part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| Just for clarification, does that mean that the sentence that you added to Part C would not be needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| No, it would still be needed, but it would apply to all non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| So change commercial to non-residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| That is her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Her motion are the changes that she just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Yes, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Okay, so discussion on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Well, I remain opposed to adding commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| I think that MPC has done a very good job of administering this over the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4849)|
| 1:20:56| And I think that, you know, not all commercial has the ability to gain density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| I mean, you have the ability to gain density in multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| We don't have the ability to gain density in a warehouse or industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| So it's a little bit unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| And I think to come back and apply it now after eight years of practice is a bit unfair to the people that have used it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| I'd like to call on former Councilman Joe Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| He was on the hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| He co-chaired the hillside protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| He was on council when this was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| And I'd like to call on you for some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Councilmembers, as a former member of this body, you may or may not know, some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| that I co-chaired the hillside and ridgeshot protection task force along with Tony Norman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4902)|
| 1:21:49| who was then county commissioner and is currently a member of the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| And we went through quite a process, a public process, many public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| And Councilman Kampen was a member of that task force also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| So we did a lot of work, and that's been a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| And so, what, at least ten years ago since that all transpired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| And I think one of the things that's happened is a loss of institutional memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| And that's no one's fault, but the people on the staff side that took the lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4940)|
| 1:22:27| meaning the former director of what was then the MPC, Mark Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4947)|
| 1:22:35| I mean, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Anyway, and the head of planning, long-range planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| I have to stop and think of these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| I knew they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| It's been so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Mike Carberry took the lead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| And on the staff side, well, the point is that the institutional memory and staff is gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| because those people have retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| And so, it's nobody's fault again, but amongst us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| other than those of us that were directly involved, that memory is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| So one of the things that I thought was important to bring up is that there was consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| Amongst other things, there was consensus on three exemptions or exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=4998)|
| 1:23:24| One was downtown, and that's pretty obvious, the reasoning behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| There are slopes in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| The new residential tower on Hill Avenue between Locust and Henley is an example of something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| that could not be constructed under those guidelines without some appellate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5018)|
| 1:23:48| Another one was interstate interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| And that was not something I initiated, but there was consensus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| And that could be debated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| TDOT controls a lot of what happens around interstate interchanges, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| But the point is that was number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| And number three was the South Waterfront Redevelopment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| And the reasoning behind that was that that is anticipated, has been for over a decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| as long-range urban development similar to downtown in terms of its planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| all the planning that went into it and the potential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| So I wanted to make sure that there was awareness of that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| because I'm not so certain there is at this point broadly shared awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| within this body and within the planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| So I felt like it was really important to bring that back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| We did a lot of hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| And, again, I believe there was consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Mr. Norman sent his apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| He could not make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| He wanted me to make clear to this council that he would be happy to come at a later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| or a later opportunity to speak either to the council as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| or to council members individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| But he couldn't, unfortunately, make it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| So that's essentially the point that I wanted to make is that there were three exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| And I will say this, parenthetically, that with the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| even though the entire redevelopment district isn't currently zoned under the special form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5121)|
| 1:25:28| that was set up, the intent was over time for that to grow into more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5128)|
| 1:25:33| if not all, of the redevelopment district that exists for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| And with form-based code, all the concerns that apply to urban development with steep slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5140)|
| 1:25:51| can be addressed through the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| As it expands, currently the form-based code that's in place now, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| does not cover any area with one exception on the west side of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| where the overlay, the hillside protection overlay also applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| But as the code does expand, which I think is an inevitability over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| then that can be addressed within the code itself, within the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| because that's the nature of form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| It's very easy to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| So unless anyone has any questions, that's what I wanted to interject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| So removing all, making it all would certainly give great limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| I don't think that there's really been an adequate amount of time spent on talking about the ramifications of the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5200)|
| 1:26:50| Even with the amendments, I appreciate the amendment on BE-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| That's really addressing already previously disturbed properties that are on hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5217)|
| 1:27:04| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| I'm opposed to making it all, and I think it's way too far reaching for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5225)|
| 1:27:11| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I just, I don't understand how, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Maybe I'm daft here, but I just don't understand how we can apply it to residential and not to other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| And so I'm going to be right where I was the last time we voted on this, which is to apply it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| And through the Stakeholders Committee, if we find it's some kind of hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| But with the flooding that we had in February, I have businesses that were asking for assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| and there isn't a pot of money to help people with the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| I had constituents trapped in their homes for over a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| And everything that's developed, particularly hillsides, impacts the water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5270)|
| 1:27:57| And if we're going to do it in one place, we need to address all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| I agree with Councilman Wallace, and I voted against this last time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| The recommendation from the Planning Commission, I'm very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| And I am comfortable, Councilwoman Welsh, with the addition of B4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| But to impose this now, I think, adds a level of confusion that is not healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| And I would prefer that we leave this alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| I think this will not be the only time we are able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| And as time moves on, I'm sure it will be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| and evolved into something a bit stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| And I think I hear you, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| but I think right now it's really awkward to put this in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| I think that's going to upset the whole pattern of development that is present right at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| Councilwoman, I mean, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| You know, environmental concerns and flooding really impact all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| Previously, when Council addressed this, I was supportive of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| this amendment applying to all properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I support it still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| In consultation with many of my neighbors, you know, in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5369)|
| 1:29:36| they are still supportive of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| So I intend to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| Any other discussion on the amendment proposed by Councilwoman Welsh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5384)|
| 1:29:58| So what have we ended up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| What is the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| We ended up with this page plus what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| It would end up looking like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| So this page you have removed residential, and then you've added number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5410)|
| 1:30:20| which I can't read it from here, but can you all read number four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| You've added number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| What changes are in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| I see making it clear that only the maximum land disturbance is applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| in non-residential districts that are within the HV overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| The density limitations would not apply in the non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| The density limitation and the land disturbance limitations would both apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5441)|
| 1:30:45| in the residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| But, again, only the land disturbance limitations would apply in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| non-residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Are you all clear about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| There is one other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| There is a provision, and this was provided to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5462)|
| 1:31:07| the provision for the Planning Commission to review plans to allow flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5467)|
| 1:31:14| in the application of the hillside protection overlay standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| That's at the bottom of C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| That's at the bottom of C, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| Everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| So let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| So does that part in C that's highlighted in blue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| it still belongs there with the changes that we've proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| Vice Mayor, your questions were answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| So like we had before, there's good discussion, difference of opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| so we are coming down to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5507)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| That's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5522)|
| 1:32:03| So it passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5523)|
| 1:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| So now that was page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| In the council-initiated, let's move on to page nine in council-initiated packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5534)|
| 1:32:28| This is number 30, which is Article 9, uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| So for halfway houses, you ask us to consider including all permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| and special uses as they exist in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| So to match the current code's equivalent, staff suggests adding S for halfway houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| In RN-5, RN-6, RN-7, O, OP, and IMU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5572)|
| 1:33:00| staff also suggests adding P for halfway houses in CG, CH, CR, and DK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5580)|
| 1:33:12| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| Is there discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| Any clarification needed on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| This is what we discussed previously, and council has responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| So what we're doing is just replicating what's in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5620)|
| 1:33:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| That passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| So moving on, the next item is on page 11 of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5626)|
| 1:33:55| Article 13, dealing with signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| We were asked to consider whether subpart of this is on page 13-15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| You're following along that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5647)|
| 1:34:17| Page 13-15 in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| It's consider in 13.9C, under historic overlay zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5663)|
| 1:34:32| Do you all see where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Consider whether subpart C should be updated in light of the change to part D below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| Staff reviewed and determined that the introductory language under the title bar for 13.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5681)|
| 1:34:48| and in subpart C match the current code's language, and therefore we recommend no changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| The signs in 13.9.C in the historic overlays are in addition to those allowed in the base zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5693)|
| 1:35:05| So unless you disagree with staff, then we'll move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| I don't think we need to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| You don't need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Yeah, unless you want to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| Motion for no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Motion for no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| So you're on 40 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Number 40, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| One of the articles I'd like to bring back up for reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Can we do that now or you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Under 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| No, on one you've already skipped over, on 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| Are we going to do it like we did last time, though, where we go through this packet and then we go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| Do you have other ones you want to bring back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Why don't we go back, if that's what he wants to do after this, just so we can then continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| That's how we did it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Cleared a packet and then started from the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| We'll clear the packet then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| So, okay, there's no action on 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Is that correct on item number 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| No action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| Per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Then we move on to page 12 of the council-initiated packet, number 44, row 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5771)|
| 1:36:19| This has to do with article 14, code administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| Council direction was to insert current code language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5785)|
| 1:36:30| This has to do with the infill housing review committee organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Council direction was to insert current code language regarding the terms for committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| if any such language exists in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| Staff has reviewed the current code and determined that this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| which only makes recommendations and not decisions, has no term or renewal language in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| Therefore, no changes are recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| So we're basically keeping it the way it has been in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Everybody agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| So no action is recommended or is taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Page 13 in the council-initiated packet, if you go to your article 16 in the recode document, throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5837)|
| 1:37:28| this has to do with zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| Throughout article 16, there are images that show the flow of different processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5852)|
| 1:37:42| Council's direction was to update this image in light of possible confusion regarding the path to council from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5862)|
| 1:37:50| appeals, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| So you have, actually, you have an attachment three series of pages that are new designs or new flow charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5872)|
| 1:38:05| You all have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| You have your packets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| Have reviewed that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| This was the packet that was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| This was in the, I know it was in the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| In the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| And so each of those, so staff basically went through each of the flow charts, you might call it, in article 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5901)|
| 1:38:30| and updated to be clear on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| And there's some examples up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| And that's attachment three in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| Are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| If not, then I'll entertain a motion to approve and include those updated images.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| On row 47, still in zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5946)|
| 1:39:15| If you see the second under staff response and or proposed edits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5955)|
| 1:39:23| Staff seeks clarification from council regarding its intent to delete the remaining portion of the sentence right to the left of this row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5963)|
| 1:39:33| Following foreseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Just read it please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| We're okay with it the way it reads, but council had some questions on whether or not this is what you intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5976)|
| 1:39:42| We think it's fine, but wanted to verify with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| Because you voted last time to strike the wording after foreseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=5986)|
| 1:40:01| We're on the second part of 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| The second part of 47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| You already voted on the first part, which is reflected to the left there under the fourth column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6005)|
| 1:40:24| I think I need clarification on what staff is asking for clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| If you look at your handout, the wording in green that does not have a strike through it was what council asked us to insert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6030)|
| 1:40:41| We weren't clear on whether you wanted us to delete what has the strike act through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6041)|
| 1:40:49| We think that's what you said, but we wanted clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| It does not appear to be needed in light of the phrase that council asked us to insert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| It was getting near the end of a long night at the end of May, and we weren't clear on your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| We feel this is your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Again, we don't feel that that wording that has a strike through it is needed, but we wanted to make sure that was council's intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6066)|
| 1:41:15| I honestly don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| But you're okay with deleting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| The last two lines is what you're asking on 16-2A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| I've got to look at this packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6092)|
| 1:41:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Motion to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| You need a motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| If you are okay with it the way it is shown here, if there's no objections, then we can just leave it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6097)|
| 1:41:45| We just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6106)|
| 1:41:47| No objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| That was your intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Then at the bottom of that page, this is another one of those minor things, but based on the changes made above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6111)|
| 1:42:00| staff recommends re-lettering the subsequent subsections in light of this change, law housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| No different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| Moving on to the next page, which is page 14 in the Council-initiated packet, row number 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6138)|
| 1:42:28| This has to do with required site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| So we're still on Article 16, zoning applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6152)|
| 1:42:39| And under the staff response, you see that in light of the change above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| Article 14.2.F.2 should be moved to Article 14.4 as new subpart G for consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6166)|
| 1:42:57| So flipping to Chapter 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6180)|
| 1:43:19| 14-1 and 14-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6199)|
| 1:43:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| Article 14.2.F.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6216)|
| 1:43:42| If you see page 14-1, Article 14.2.F.2, where it says site plan review applications for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6222)|
| 1:43:53| I'm on the right thing, right, Christina and Gerald?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| And multifamily dwellings in the RN-4 district per section 4.2.B.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6236)|
| 1:44:03| That should be moved to Article 14.4, which is the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6243)|
| 1:44:12| I think, Mayor, if I may, I think what we're proposing is as shown on the screen up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| that we're deleting number 3 from here and relocating it to 14.4 here on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6257)|
| 1:44:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| Well, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| So in that section, 14.4, 14.2, this is on page 14-1, 14.2.F.2, site plan review applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6278)|
| 1:44:50| for townhouse and multifamily dwellings moves to zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| Actually, that's a typo, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| It's 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Is it supposed to be 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| It should be 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Yeah, that's where I got off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| It's actually 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| Which is what's green with the line through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| And so in my packet for May, it's blue and underlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| Landscape plans for all development that require landscape per Article 12 with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| of alternative landscape design per section 12.2D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| That is going to move to zoning administrator powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| So I think the only thing is I had a constituent question about and I'm confused about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| let me find the right Post-it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| Over on page 12.2, because we're flipping back and forth from 16 to 14 to 12, on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6341)|
| 1:45:51| 12.2, maybe I'm not making the synapse connections in my brain, but on page 12.2 in part C there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6351)|
| 1:45:59| towards the top, Ms. Magrins, it says, we struck, we voted to strike zoning administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6359)|
| 1:46:08| in there and change it to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| That was a council-initiated change that's in another part of the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| Now we're moving it to the zoning administrator's powers on another page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| That was another change later on in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| So what we are suggesting in the staff-initiated and council-initiated documents is all geared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| at making everything consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| So this is something that, you know, council's intent at the May 30th meeting was to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| the landscaping approval in the zoning administrator's authority and not the planning commission's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6402)|
| 1:46:51| So why did we vote to, because that's not my recollection, on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6411)|
| 1:47:03| When I look at, let me go back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6423)|
| 1:47:15| When I look at page 11 of this white packet council-initiated changes, we specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6435)|
| 1:47:23| voted 9-0 to make that review by the administrative review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6443)|
| 1:47:32| Last edit of D2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Okay, that's D2C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Maybe it's page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| Alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6466)|
| 1:47:55| I'll just make a note and come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| That's particular to the alternative landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| Mayor, I think I remember what was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| It's in the blue packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| Peter, or Mr. Ahrens, wasn't this a change that was made for kind of a better customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6492)|
| 1:48:23| experience and then maybe efficiency for your staff to be reviewing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6503)|
| 1:48:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| As I recall, section 12.2 was changed initially, as Councilwoman Ryder had described, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6512)|
| 1:48:42| there was a typo, but then later on in Article 14, that's when there was a conversation with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6522)|
| 1:48:56| Councilman Roberto, and we discussed efficiencies, and we made that wholesale change to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| So I think you've identified an area that we need to go back and flip, but it was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6544)|
| 1:49:13| understanding after the last council workshop that the landscape review enforcement was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| going to fall under plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| And if you look in the white packet on number 50, the first part of it, you can see we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6565)|
| 1:49:32| and council approved deleting what was there to allow the landscape review to go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6572)|
| 1:49:38| the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6578)|
| 1:49:40| So what we're proposing here just creates consistency and cleans everything up to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| it consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And Director Aarons, while I have your attention on this, you don't currently have any staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| that would be able to do this landscape review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6599)|
| 1:50:00| I've been in discussions with the administration, and we are making preparations in anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| of the landscape requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| If RECODE was to pass, I would assume you would have the staff required to enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6617)|
| 1:50:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| So if we're going to change it in Article 16, Article 14, then we're also going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6624)|
| 1:50:30| to amend Article 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| Can I call on Ms. Feld to speak since this recommendation came from Scenic Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Ms. Feld, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| So I'm a little confused because MPC recommended in December that this landscape review, landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6648)|
| 1:50:56| plans be reviewed by planning staff instead of plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6656)|
| 1:51:05| I know that plans review requested additional staff to help with this, but my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| is that staff is not going to be forthcoming from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| So I think when this discussion was had on May 30th, there was an assumption made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6675)|
| 1:51:25| plans review would have increased staff to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| So since they're not, Scenic Knoxville would like to suggest that this go back to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| I want to call on Mr. Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| Yeah, we were waiting to see when RECO would be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| We're planning on adding additional staff with those skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| So that discussion about having a single location for review for developers so they didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| bounced, although we have a great working relationship with Knox Planning, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| But we were waiting to see when the adoption would happen, and we're prepared to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| This fiscal year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6733)|
| 1:52:14| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| Do you need a motion there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| We need a motion to approve that moving to Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| So do you need a motion to adjust Article 12 as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| So you're on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| What page are you on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Just help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Page 12-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| She's freewheeling right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| I'm not freewheeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| Am I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6763)|
| 1:52:44| It's related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| Let's not get lost in landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| We're going to get to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Oh, we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| So just note to yourself that it doesn't have a blank box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| It looks like we already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| We did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| It's on page 12-2 at Part C, Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| I mean, what page in the blue packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| Number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| Line number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| I just want to make all our C references square up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6781)|
| 1:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| This was when...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| This is where it gets confusing because you gave it to Planning 12C with that blank box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| So I'm not sure what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| I'm talking about the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6786)|

| 1:54:51| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| It's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| It's on page 16-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| 16-32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| The new page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| If you look at subsection A5, you see it is, it shows that we removed A5, this is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6915)|
| 1:55:36| staff, we moved A5, that is in green, struck out, and if this is, 30 day limit is removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6936)|
| 1:55:46| then this subsection likely becomes unnecessary, the reviewing body is in subpart A3, so basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6946)|
| 1:55:57| we want to delete that A.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6957)|
| 1:56:15| So the only thing I have is I have a note here from last time when we discussed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| about public notice, so 30 day time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6980)|
| 1:56:31| If the 30 day time limit is removed, the subsection is unnecessary, so we're saying that A5 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=6991)|
| 1:56:46| unnecessary because the reviewing body is in subpart A3 above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7006)|
| 1:56:59| So Lauren, you see that the Board of Zoning Appeals must evaluate the application based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| upon the evidence presented at the public hearing, so this is where you get in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| hearing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7027)|
| 1:57:18| So I think the question that arose last time was, the Board of Zoning Appeals takes formal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7038)|
| 1:57:25| action on appeals of the decisions made by the zoning administrator, so if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| appeal a decision made by the zoning administrator, or the director of plans review, it goes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| BZA, the planning commission takes formal action on all other decisions made by Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7054)|
| 1:57:41| Knox County planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| What are those decisions and are they public noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| And didn't we have a discussion last time, things aren't public noticed because they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7068)|
| 1:57:55| in the office, they're administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| They're in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| If you look on page 15-2, the table 15-2, it states the approvals that are granted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7078)|
| 1:58:07| how the notice type for those approvals, if there's a staff approval, actually I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| to think under the new three code, planning staff makes recommendations to the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7093)|
| 1:58:21| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Basically the infill housing is for the downtown design review, all those are publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7103)|
| 1:58:30| There are no decisions such as the issuance of a building permit that would be done by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| the plans review director that are made that are not publicly, somewhere in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7114)|
| 1:58:40| realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| They're not in that boat of making those decisions without some public awareness of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7123)|
| 1:58:54| I think the interpretations of the zoning ordinance are handled by the director of plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7134)|
| 1:59:01| review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Those would be without a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| The issuance of a zoning letter or zoning letter are by the director of plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| I'll let Mr. Ahrens address how those might be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| That was one of the reasons for removing that 30 day time limit for appealing because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7155)|
| 1:59:19| is no public notice of those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| That enables a citizen, when they become aware of that decision, to then appeal the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| We make about 20 zoning interpretations a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| We're really working hard to help promote development and help folks work through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| bureaucratic processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Right now, there's not a public notice for every permit application that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| That would be a daunting task to publicly notify everybody of if you want to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7195)|
| 2:00:03| your basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| It's not something we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| Again, removing that 30 day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7208)|
| 2:00:12| These are decisions about you need to do it this way or that way to get your building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| Those things are not normally public noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| You either meet the code or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| A lot of times, it's the applicants who are displeased with us because they want us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7223)|
| 2:00:31| see it in their favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| That's when they will appeal us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| That's what the Board of Zoning Appeals hears from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| Ms. Malone, do you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7245)|
| 2:00:46| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| At present, there is no time limit on the appeal of a decision, issuance of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7248)|
| 2:00:56| permit or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Those decisions are made many, many times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| They are made administratively in an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| The public doesn't know a decision has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Very often, the unhappy person is the person trying to get the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| That person knows when the decision is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7275)|
| 2:01:20| Very often also, it's the neighbors who dispute what sometimes are not black and white decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7280)|
| 2:01:28| that are questions of interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| If you have a 30-day notice, the public is cut out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7290)|
| 2:01:33| There aren't many appeals of this type, but when there is a need for one, if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| a 30-day notice, the public is just out of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| They won't know about it until you wait until the 31st day and then start doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7310)|
| 2:01:51| It will be too late to appeal and it's a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Very often, I think the appeals that do go before the BZA, initiated by the public, don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7315)|
| 2:02:02| affect what's happening on the property at the time, but it clarifies the position of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7322)|
| 2:02:08| the city going forward on similar cases that's frequently how the zoning ordinance ends up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7328)|
| 2:02:15| being tweaked because somebody says, we didn't know this would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7335)|
| 2:02:21| Yes, it is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| We've already issued a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| We can't take it back, but going forward, we ought to put in some provisions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7343)|
| 2:02:29| zoning ordinance so it can't happen again in some other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| Leaving the 30 days out is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7353)|
| 2:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Which is what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| We're cutting it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| We're just clarifying based on our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I think that's what I'm confused about because I thought we got rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| It wasn't a formal vote on removing it at the last meeting, and that's why you see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7372)|
| 2:02:57| as being stricken but not fully removed from this document because we still needed a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| But that was really the only point of that subsection was to put the 30-day time limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| in place, but if we remove that and get a vote on it, we're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| I'll make a motion to remove that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| We already have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| And again, that's A5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| 8.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7401)|
| 2:03:23| And a motion and a second on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| Mayor, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7406)|
| 2:03:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Director Green, we're talking about plan development here in Article 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7408)|
| 2:03:36| Will the deletion of this, it's my understanding that this would come to council in the form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7416)|
| 2:03:42| of a preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Would this change happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7424)|
| 2:03:45| I mean, there's not any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| There's no staff decision out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| There's a staff recommendation that goes to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| Planning Commission recommendation then comes to the City Council, so there would be all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| those public hearings, public notices, posting of the property, postcards to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| owners within 300 feet, legal ad on the agenda on the planning, Knoxville, Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7444)|
| 2:04:12| website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| So, by making this change, we're not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| We're not impacting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| We're not changing the amount of public notice someone would have about these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| We are now on row 52, Article 17, nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7472)|
| 2:04:40| You all ask staff to propose revisions to clarify nonconforming buildings, uses, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| structures, as well as when each subsection applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7486)|
| 2:04:50| So we're on 17-1, page 17-1, I'm sorry, and it's 17.1.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7490)|
| 2:05:01| So you can see in green, it says to add the title, nonconforming use and or structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7501)|
| 2:05:10| and or structure building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7510)|
| 2:05:16| You see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| And then under 17.1.A.2, to add the title, nonconforming structures slash buildings only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7517)|
| 2:05:27| Both of those are in green, underlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7527)|
| 2:05:32| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7534)|
| 2:05:35| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7535)|

| 2:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| On both of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7540)|
| 2:05:41| On both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| That's the two of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7542)|
| 2:05:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7543)|
| 2:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| So that is the end of this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7545)|
| 2:05:47| We can now start circling back if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| Just so you all know, when we finish this at some point soon, we will take a brief break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| within sitting here two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| I want to go back to 36, Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| This is the number of people in a home, in a house, for rental purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7566)|
| 2:06:12| I'd like to call on Elizabeth Rowland to come speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| I don't know if she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| She comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Ms. Rowland, as you come, this is Article 10 in the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7580)|
| 2:06:28| Residential occupancy standards is really where we left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| So it should be page 10.10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| I believe if we're talking about the residential occupancy standards, I believe those might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| be in Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| I'm on the wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7601)|

| 2:06:51| This Article 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| 4.2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7612)|

| 2:07:02| It's page 4 and number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7622)|

| 2:07:08| You see Article 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7628)|
| 2:07:09| This was a 5-4 vote then, and I think it's probably 1-4 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7629)|

| 2:07:53| On behalf of the Knox County Democratic Party Progressive Action Committee, I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| to express concern regarding the residential occupancy standards 4.2.C and D recently added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7677)|
| 2:08:04| into the recode text draft 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| I would also like to express our support for an amendment as proposed by the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| Area Association of Realtors that I believe you have received by email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| The occupancy standards recently added into recode are unclear, unenforceable, confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7697)|
| 2:08:24| and discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| When I contacted some council members and staff, I was unable to receive a clear and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7705)|
| 2:08:32| consistent explanation as to what the verbiage of the standards even means or requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| For example, 4.2.C starts by laying out three categories of groups that can reside in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| One, a family, two, a functional family, or three, any one of the following groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7725)|
| 2:08:53| quote, any one of the following groups or persons where one or more of whom is not related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| So let's start with that third group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| 4.2.C. 3 provides one example of such a group that would be permitted in all zones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7746)|
| 2:09:14| allow residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| It says up to three people in quote, houses, attached houses, and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7756)|
| 2:09:24| If you combine that with criteria from 4.2.C, I read that as meaning a group of three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7764)|
| 2:09:34| where one or more of those three people is not related by blood, marriage, adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| or guardianship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| That means if you have a house, say with four bedrooms, only three people are allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| to live there if one or more of those three people is not related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7788)|
| 2:09:53| So if you have two parents and a child, you apparently aren't allowed to have a live-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7793)|
| 2:09:57| nanny in your home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| When asking for clarification, I was told that the three-person limit only applies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| the number of unrelated people, not to the number of related people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| So you could have three unrelated people, but as many related people as you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| However, the text simply does not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7815)|
| 2:10:18| It allows quote, any one of the following groups or persons where one or more of whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7818)|
| 2:10:26| is not related by blood, marriage, adoption, or guardianship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| And the number limit given for that group for houses, attached houses, and duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| in all zones that allow residential uses is up to three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7837)|
| 2:10:42| It doesn't say up to three unrelated people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7842)|
| 2:10:45| It says up to three persons, quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7845)|
| 2:10:48| And that's three persons regardless of the size of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| That is clearly too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| And if the number limit is not meant to apply to the related people within that group, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7854)|
| 2:11:01| which at least one of the person is unrelated, then the text is very poorly written and needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| to be revised anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Are you confused yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| So am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| And that is one of the many examples I could give of the lack of clarity in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| residential occupancy standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| Now let's go back to the second category of groups allowed to live together, the quote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| In recent decades, the societal definition of a family has evolved, expanded, and modernized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7885)|
| 2:11:31| As we modernize our zoning code, we should also modernize our occupancy standards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| be respectful of all kinds of families, whether the individuals are related by marriage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| blood or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| It should not be the role of city government to tell our residents who they are and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| not allowed to live with, whether or not they are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| In summary, KCDP, Progressive Action Committee, believes the occupancy standards recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| added to the recode are unclear, unenforceable, confusing, and discriminatory, and they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| We also, we do support reasonable and appropriate residential occupancy standards based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| characteristics of the dwelling unit so that the city can fulfill its duty to protect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7933)|
| 2:12:18| health, the safety, and welfare of our city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| We do not support incorporating characteristics of the people in the dwelling units into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| standards as that is inevitably discriminatory and unenforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| We support the amendment proposed by the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors, which draws on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7952)|
| 2:12:37| language based on various floor space requirements found in the city's property maintenance code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7957)|
| 2:12:43| HUD guidelines, and other resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| We just ask that in defining bedroom in their amendment that you allow for studio apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7965)|
| 2:12:52| and lofts that may not have a separate bedroom because they are open layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7972)|
| 2:12:57| That is all I have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| And just one other addition, the Progressive Action Committee does support the recode text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7979)|
| 2:13:05| as a compromised document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| It is not perfect, but we support the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| We think the map needs work with more R and 3 and more R and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7993)|
| 2:13:14| Thank you very much, Alyssa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| So the recommendation that I am coming with is the language is based on various floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=7995)|
| 2:13:23| space requirements and using HUD guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8003)|
| 2:13:27| So what I am recommending is eliminate the number of persons and all that and replace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| it with minimum space requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| It shall be unlawful for any person to occupy or let another for occupancy any dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| unit which does not contain at least 150 square feet of floor space for each occupant thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8022)|
| 2:13:51| including at least 50 square feet of bedroom space for each occupant thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8031)|
| 2:13:54| The floor space shall be calculated on the basis of total enclosed habitable space within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8034)|
| 2:14:00| dwelling, no attached garage, basement, or cellar space shall be used for floor space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8040)|
| 2:14:05| under this section unless such space was lawfully improved and finished for occupancy in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8045)|
| 2:14:12| with all applicable requirements of the City Code as it existed at the time of the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| Accessory structures, except those that are accessory dwelling units, shall not be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| for occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| So it is based on floor space and it is based on finished floor space instead of who the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| occupants are and their relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| Councilman Walsh, would you, just to clarify your motion, are you, sorry, I am muting myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8070)|
| 2:14:39| you are talking about eliminating all of the text that is in green in 4.2 that talks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8079)|
| 2:14:48| in section C and D around functional family, which I totally support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| I just want to make sure that you are...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| 4.2C, residential occupancy standards, that would all be strict and then we would add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| this that is based on square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| And D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| And D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8104)|
| 2:15:05| And D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| And what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| And D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| 4.2C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8109)|
| 2:15:10| In the document, page 4-2 and 4-3, in the zoning code, you would, on 4-2, you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8110)|
| 2:15:21| delete C, it is 4.2C, residential occupancy standards, going over on to the next page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8121)|
| 2:15:29| and D, which is the criteria for functional family determination, those would all be stricken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8129)|
| 2:15:36| It goes on to the next page as well, correct, all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8136)|
| 2:15:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8139)|
| 2:15:40| And instead it would have this paragraph that we received in an e-mail that D just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| I was trying to see what else is in D that, you know, that we are wiping out there, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8143)|
| 2:15:48| I do not know if that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| I think it is the definition of the functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8151)|
| 2:15:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Did you all review this from Jennifer Rocha?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8156)|
| 2:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8158)|
| 2:15:59| So is there anything else that would that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| Is that what she said, all of D, D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Is there anything else that is missing if that paragraph in yellow was, that he just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8161)|
| 2:16:07| read, would be replaced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| No, as long as parts C and D were removed as well, that would be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8169)|
| 2:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8173)|
| 2:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| That would be my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| That is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| I second that, but I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| Would you be willing to add to your motion something that accounts for studio apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8182)|
| 2:16:29| or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| Where would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| That is what Ms. Rowland referred to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8194)|
| 2:16:36| Again, where is that, Ms. Rowland, that you would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Mayor, one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| I think the property maintenance code...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| Addresses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| We're trying to shove a lot of the property maintenance into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8203)|
| 2:16:47| I think that would be covered under property maintenance, and you wouldn't need to duplicate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| But I'm going to look at Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| I'm going to look at Christina and see if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8214)|
| 2:16:56| Am I wrong on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| A version of this is included in the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| The change that's recommended here, though, my understanding from Jennifer Roche, is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8222)|
| 2:17:08| we wanted to make allowances for smaller bedroom sizes, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8228)|
| 2:17:12| in historic homes that were built with different dimensional requirements and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8232)|
| 2:17:16| So that's why it's a little bit different than the property maintenance code, but not by very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| So that may not need to be addressed, the studio space, if it's already addressed in the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8242)|
| 2:17:29| You say you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| It is addressed in the property maintenance code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| Then I will second the motion as presented by Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| I just have an issue with tiny homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| That might not be covered under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| The space is pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| We've adopted the appendix in the International Residential Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| which specifically addresses tiny homes, and they're not inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8272)|
| 2:17:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| So we're still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| Do you have more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8279)|
| 2:18:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| Director Ahrens, this floor space model that Councilmember Wallace has proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8282)|
| 2:18:12| in order for you to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| Do you have access to blueprints and plans for residents that you might be able to check on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8293)|
| 2:18:25| We do not have historic records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| We are moving towards keeping records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| but I don't have access to every floor plan of the houses in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| So for you to enforce this, would you have to knock on the door and actually enter the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8322)|
| 2:18:43| I think we could get a rough estimate from KGIS using a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8323)|
| 2:18:47| Because we're talking gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| We can get the area of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| We can tell if it's a one-story or two-story or split level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| So we can get a good ballpark idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| But you won't know how many bedrooms there are unless you go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| That is a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| So in essence, in order to enforce this as amended, you'd have to enter the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8346)|
| 2:19:11| We would ask to enter the house, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| The current language, I would agree with Ms. Rowland, that the current language needs updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8353)|
| 2:19:19| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| But I don't think this is the forum to do that updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| And I will commit to working on that language in the future, in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8364)|
| 2:19:31| probably looking at it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| It does need to get updated, and I think there's a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| What's important here is that this, and we've had this discussion now, this is the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8377)|
| 2:19:42| these are guardrails that 90% of the population will obey, and you'll have a few people who don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8382)|
| 2:19:49| But when you get rid of these rules and you make them completely unenforceable without entering the premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| then when Peter goes to the door and knocks on it, you know, what happens now is he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| how many people live here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| And they say, you know, six people live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| And he tells them, well, you can't have that many folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| You know, these are the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| I've heard from multiple neighborhoods, many of whom are represented here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8411)|
| 2:20:16| all already said that they support maintaining this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| If you don't do this, then you could end up with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| a real parking problem next door, a noise problem next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8425)|
| 2:20:28| and you just made it impossible for Director Ahrens to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8428)|
| 2:20:34| I might add, typically when we go the first time, we get an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| So if we were to go out and ask, how many bedrooms do you have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| And they say, oh, we've got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| But you can't just magically add bedrooms where you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Well, you can illegally, but at least you've got them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| But, no, we wouldn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| And that would authorize us to go in and enter the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| versus you can magically make people disappear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| So from that perspective, I see some value added here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| only because most people are pretty honest the first time you come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| Well, I still think that I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| This language needs updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| We could spend the next four hours updating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| I still support it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| but I do think we need to commit to changing it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| And so, Council, I think you guys recall we had a very extensive conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| on this section at one of the work sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| And so a lot of it did go back to how do you prove who lives there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8497)|
| 2:21:43| how do you prove who's related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| And normally, and I think you actually admitted that it's very hard to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| Normally you guys would not go out unless someone, a neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| has called in a complaint that there is an excessive amount of people living in a particular home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8514)|
| 2:22:00| So what we're saying with this amendment is that if you receive that complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| you would then go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| I don't know if you would have equipped in advance the square footage of the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| Would that be correct if we changed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| If we were to enforce those proposed occupancy standards, once we received a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8534)|
| 2:22:20| we'd go on KGIS, we'd do our research ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| we'd find out how many stories ballparked the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8542)|
| 2:22:25| And actually we can probably go through the tax records and get square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| There's ways where we can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| And then knock on the door, ask the question, how many bedrooms do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| And actually we might even have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8557)|
| 2:22:40| I don't know how reliable Zillow is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| but a lot of times you can find information on houses through the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| So, and I'm not opposed to updating the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8569)|
| 2:22:52| I am concerned with item number four that's listed under D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| that actually includes society, club, fraternity, sorority, association, lodge, organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8578)|
| 2:23:04| groups of students or other individuals with a common living arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| or basis for the establishment of the household is temporary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| or any group of individuals who are in a group living arrangement as a result of criminal offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8591)|
| 2:23:20| So I'd like to get some clarification because I don't recall that part about criminal offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8600)|
| 2:23:28| But I do feel that it could be a detriment to neighborhoods to have fraternities living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8608)|
| 2:23:38| a bunch of fraternity kids living in a house that's not zoned for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| But if you could give us some clarification on the group of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8623)|
| 2:23:47| who are in a group living arrangement as a result of criminal offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8627)|
| 2:23:50| are you referring to a halfway house or transitional house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| So in that instance, if that is the purpose of a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| then that home should be, if it is truly a transitional living type home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| that is not being, following the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| someone just has a house and decides that they want to make it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| without going through the proper channels, then would they be fined at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8655)|
| 2:24:21| What would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| So there's different protections for those other types of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8663)|
| 2:24:27| where we work closely with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| If they're not going through those other channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| and it's just a house with several people living in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| then yes, we would issue a notice of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| and follow up with them through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| If we were to take this out, would we still have that same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| and I'm not necessarily just singling out someone that's running a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| and a home illegally as a halfway house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| but even for the examples of fraternity houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8695)|
| 2:24:59| where you have a group of kids living there and are in and out quite a bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8699)|
| 2:25:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| I think I'd have to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| I know I haven't searched our tax records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8712)|
| 2:25:15| but I'm sure that we can find the number of bedrooms in each residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| so we'll have the information ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| We can ask the number of people, the number of bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| I think this gives us better tools to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8728)|
| 2:25:36| I may have lost track of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| If we were to take number four out under D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| would this kind of open the door for people to potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| just kind of rent a house out for fraternity kids on a temporary basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8751)|
| 2:26:01| Sororities, other groups where people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| they're not even necessarily considered like a renter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8764)|
| 2:26:07| but it's temporary housing and someone's capitalizing off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| I'll say practically we don't dive into Part D, which is in the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8771)|
| 2:26:16| It becomes real invasive for the inspector to go start asking those very personal questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8776)|
| 2:26:24| Right now, practically speaking, we focus on the number of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| and if somebody offers us, hey, this is my sister,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8788)|
| 2:26:34| they tell us the makeup, but we generally don't probe that deep into who the people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8794)|
| 2:26:41| We really focus on the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| Okay. So let me shift gears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8804)|
| 2:26:45| If this is removed, if we take all of this out because it is not enforceable by your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8805)|
| 2:26:52| then if neighbors have complaints on any type of housing situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| that they feel is very disruptive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| then that would then become a legal matter where they would just call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8819)|
| 2:27:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| Yes. That happens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| If they're disruptive, they're going to call the cops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| and the cops are going to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| If item number D is removed in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8832)|
| 2:27:18| we focus less on who you are and how you're related to the person you're living with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| and we're focusing strictly on the size of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| the number of bedrooms, and the number of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| I think that's the only thing that it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| is it takes out that extra factor of inquiring as to how people are related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8854)|
| 2:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Yeah, I am inclined to support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8867)|
| 2:27:51| I have been hearing about this since I arrived in Knoxville in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| It was a lengthy conversation before I got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| I think it was voted on by MPC, the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| It exists, and it's in the code, but it was taken out for recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| and then we voted to put it back in, and I certainly supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| But if you look at page 15 of the white packet we've been going through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| items for future discussion or possible action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| revisit residential occupancy standards and functional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| Is there a better way to address the issues, but an enforceable and more meaningful way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8900)|
| 2:28:25| If I had more time to burn, I might go back and watch those ancient meetings from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190716?start=8905)|
